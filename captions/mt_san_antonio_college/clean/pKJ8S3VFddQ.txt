[00:02:49 - 00:02:53] done with negotiations i want
[00:02:53 - 00:02:53] to give a very special
[00:02:53 - 00:02:56] thank you to soa and
[00:02:56 - 00:02:59] alexis for working closely with
[00:02:59 - 00:02:59] the fa the last few
[00:02:59 - 00:03:02] weeks in order to bring
[00:03:02 - 00:03:02] negotiations to a close i
[00:03:02 - 00:03:04] also want to thank the
[00:03:04 - 00:03:06] rest of the district team
[00:03:06 - 00:03:06] that's tammy back there thank
[00:03:09 - 00:03:09] you tammy uh lance cooji
[00:03:09 - 00:03:11] kelly and adam it's been
[00:03:11 - 00:03:12] a pleasure working with all
[00:03:12 - 00:03:15] of them the rapid pace
[00:03:15 - 00:03:15] in which we worked to
[00:03:17 - 00:03:20] close negotiations required multiple emails
[00:03:20 - 00:03:23] phone calls text messages emergency
[00:03:23 - 00:03:25] meetings sometimes they were all
[00:03:25 - 00:03:25] at the same time and
[00:03:25 - 00:03:27] multiple times within a day
[00:03:27 - 00:03:29] while we are glad negotiations
[00:03:29 - 00:03:29] are over it is worth
[00:03:31 - 00:03:31] noting that the pressure to
[00:03:31 - 00:03:33] close negotiations ramped up this
[00:03:33 - 00:03:35] kind of communication as we
[00:03:35 - 00:03:38] move into a new negotiation
[00:03:38 - 00:03:38] cycle the fa wants to
[00:03:38 - 00:03:40] see this kind of invigoration
[00:03:40 - 00:03:43] from the district from the
[00:03:43 - 00:03:43] start if we want to
[00:03:46 - 00:03:46] meet whatever deadline we set
[00:03:46 - 00:03:49] for next year let's get
[00:03:49 - 00:03:52] some very clear logical proposals
[00:03:52 - 00:03:52] written from day one so
[00:03:52 - 00:03:54] they can begin negotiated and
[00:03:54 - 00:03:58] approved as quickly as possible
[00:04:00 - 00:04:00] also i get a sense
[00:04:00 - 00:04:02] that there's going to be
[00:04:02 - 00:04:02] a theme for negotiations during
[00:04:04 - 00:04:04] the next cycle and i
[00:04:04 - 00:04:06] want to talk a little
[00:04:06 - 00:04:06] about that um the country
[00:04:06 - 00:04:08] is going through a sort
[00:04:08 - 00:04:08] of what i call an
[00:04:10 - 00:04:10] existential crisis and if any
[00:04:10 - 00:04:12] of you just looked at
[00:04:12 - 00:04:15] the news um that continues
[00:04:15 - 00:04:15] to this very moment um
[00:04:15 - 00:04:17] and i believe this sense
[00:04:17 - 00:04:20] of dread is affecting our
[00:04:20 - 00:04:20] students imagine you're a student
[00:04:23 - 00:04:23] today and you wake up
[00:04:23 - 00:04:26] to the news you wake
[00:04:26 - 00:04:26] up to new laws new
[00:04:26 - 00:04:29] rules new policies new guidelines
[00:04:29 - 00:04:32] new acts of violence and
[00:04:32 - 00:04:32] this affects who you are
[00:04:36 - 00:04:36] your family your work your
[00:04:36 - 00:04:39] career and your education i
[00:04:39 - 00:04:39] want to emphasize that mount
[00:04:39 - 00:04:42] sack needs to continue to
[00:04:42 - 00:04:42] be a safe place for
[00:04:44 - 00:04:44] students um where they can
[00:04:44 - 00:04:47] find support and solace in
[00:04:47 - 00:04:50] this everchanging world faculty and
[00:04:50 - 00:04:50] staff need to continue to
[00:04:50 - 00:04:52] be empathetic and professional in
[00:04:52 - 00:04:55] order to give students the
[00:04:55 - 00:04:55] keys to success and i
[00:04:57 - 00:04:57] want to ask that you
[00:04:57 - 00:04:59] keep this in mind when
[00:04:59 - 00:04:59] we enter the next cycle
[00:04:59 - 00:04:59] of when we enter the
[00:05:00 - 00:05:00] next cycle of negotiations negotiations
[00:05:03 - 00:05:03] finally uh you've heard me
[00:05:03 - 00:05:04] ask quite a few times
[00:05:04 - 00:05:04] and so i'm going to
[00:05:04 - 00:05:07] ask one more time that
[00:05:07 - 00:05:09] lead negotiators have additional time
[00:05:09 - 00:05:11] to give you important updates
[00:05:11 - 00:05:14] and important information regarding negotiations

[03:03:07 - 03:03:09] to the college and the
[03:03:09 - 03:03:11] students are inspiring for over
[03:03:11 - 03:03:11] 20 years i've been fortunate
[03:03:12 - 03:03:12] to serve as a professional
[03:03:12 - 03:03:14] trumpet player composer arranger and
[03:03:16 - 03:03:16] educator my career has taken
[03:03:16 - 03:03:18] me from high school to
[03:03:18 - 03:03:19] college programs to the national
[03:03:19 - 03:03:21] stage with drumcore international and
[03:03:21 - 03:03:22] wintergard international and i've had
[03:03:22 - 03:03:23] the privilege of helping build
[03:03:23 - 03:03:25] ensembles from the ground up
[03:03:25 - 03:03:27] each of those experiences has
[03:03:27 - 03:03:29] prepar prepared me for this
[03:03:29 - 03:03:29] moment and i can honestly
[03:03:29 - 03:03:31] say this is my dream
[03:03:31 - 03:03:34] job what makes mount sack
[03:03:34 - 03:03:36] so special is its mission
[03:03:36 - 03:03:36] to access and excellence this
[03:03:38 - 03:03:38] is a place where students
[03:03:38 - 03:03:39] of all backgrounds and experiences
[03:03:39 - 03:03:42] can come together discover their
[03:03:42 - 03:03:43] voice and be part of
[03:03:43 - 03:03:45] something larger than themselves the
[03:03:45 - 03:03:48] marching man embodies that spirit
[03:03:48 - 03:03:48] it's a melting pot of
[03:03:48 - 03:03:50] our entire community where students
[03:03:50 - 03:03:51] with many years of experience
[03:03:51 - 03:03:52] stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those picking
[03:03:55 - 03:03:55] up instruments for the first
[03:03:55 - 03:03:57] time together they learn they
[03:03:57 - 03:03:59] grow and they create something
[03:03:59 - 03:04:01] that none of us could
[03:04:01 - 03:04:01] do alone i am humbled
[03:04:01 - 03:04:03] to lead this effort and
[03:04:03 - 03:04:03] i'm eager to see the
[03:04:05 - 03:04:05] marching man become a visible
[03:04:05 - 03:04:08] symbol of pride for this
[03:04:08 - 03:04:10] college i look forward to

[03:05:21 - 03:05:21] uh take over one of
[03:05:21 - 03:05:23] the full-time tenure track positions
[03:05:23 - 03:05:25] here in communication studies um
[03:05:25 - 03:05:27] this is my 13th year
[03:05:27 - 03:05:27] of teaching i'm a southern
[03:05:29 - 03:05:29] california native um i spent
[03:05:29 - 03:05:30] the last decade or so
[03:05:30 - 03:05:32] working at different institutions between
[03:05:32 - 03:05:34] california and the midwest um
[03:05:34 - 03:05:34] and when i first applied
[03:05:36 - 03:05:36] for this job much like
[03:05:36 - 03:05:37] anyone who's applying for a
[03:05:37 - 03:05:37] job you try to do
[03:05:37 - 03:05:39] due diligence to make sure
[03:05:39 - 03:05:42] that you say the right
[03:05:42 - 03:05:42] things in the room and
[03:05:42 - 03:05:44] uh there was uh a
[03:05:44 - 03:05:44] quotation that came to mind
[03:05:46 - 03:05:46] when i first started doing
[03:05:46 - 03:05:48] research for this job um
[03:05:48 - 03:05:48] it was from a movie
[03:05:48 - 03:05:49] that came out in the
[03:05:49 - 03:05:51] early 2000s called acceptance that
[03:05:51 - 03:05:51] was about a guy who
[03:05:51 - 03:05:52] was trying to find his
[03:05:52 - 03:05:54] place in the world and
[03:05:54 - 03:05:54] couldn't find the right college
[03:05:54 - 03:05:56] for himself so he made
[03:05:56 - 03:05:58] his own um and there's
[03:05:58 - 03:05:58] a line in that movie
[03:05:58 - 03:05:59] that says that there are
[03:05:59 - 03:06:00] so few truths in this
[03:06:01 - 03:06:01] world that when you see
[03:06:01 - 03:06:03] one you know it and
[03:06:03 - 03:06:03] when going through and doing
[03:06:04 - 03:06:05] due diligence for the job
[03:06:05 - 03:06:08] despite having been at other
[03:06:08 - 03:06:11] colleges and universities i saw
[03:06:11 - 03:06:11] a campus and a faculty
[03:06:11 - 03:06:14] and a set of staff
[03:06:14 - 03:06:14] and a board and a
[03:06:14 - 03:06:16] community that cared and i
[03:06:16 - 03:06:19] spent the last 13 years
[03:06:19 - 03:06:19] learning how to reall in
[03:06:19 - 03:06:20] love with education and every
[03:06:20 - 03:06:23] year the students make that
[03:06:23 - 03:06:23] job so much easier and
[03:06:23 - 03:06:25] when i was doing doing
[03:06:25 - 03:06:27] research and looking around on
[03:06:27 - 03:06:27] this campus it was very
[03:06:27 - 03:06:29] clear that our goals aligned
[03:06:29 - 03:06:31] and i wanted nothing but
[03:06:31 - 03:06:31] to nothing more than to
[03:06:31 - 03:06:34] be part of a college
[03:06:34 - 03:06:36] whose uh ethos and identity
[03:06:36 - 03:06:38] and passion overlapped with mine
[03:06:38 - 03:06:38] so when coming to apply
[03:06:38 - 03:06:40] for the job um it
[03:06:40 - 03:06:40] was a tremendous honor to
[03:06:40 - 03:06:42] be offered the position and
[03:06:42 - 03:06:44] in just three weeks it
[03:06:44 - 03:06:44] is very clear that not
[03:06:44 - 03:06:46] only is this a place
[03:06:46 - 03:06:46] that i feel welcomed and
[03:06:48 - 03:06:48] supported but i'm surrounded by
[03:06:49 - 03:06:49] colleagues who care about students
[03:06:50 - 03:06:51] in the way that i
[03:06:51 - 03:06:52] do and i'm so honored
[03:06:53 - 03:06:53] and blessed to be here

[03:07:23 - 03:07:25] supporting me in the other
[03:07:25 - 03:07:28] room for those watching my
[03:07:28 - 03:07:28] name is dr silia tosskano
[03:07:31 - 03:07:31] my pronouns are she her
[03:07:31 - 03:07:33] and aya what being employed
[03:07:33 - 03:07:33] at mount sack means to
[03:07:33 - 03:07:37] me is coming full circle
[03:07:37 - 03:07:39] we have a 40-year history
[03:07:39 - 03:07:39] in my family connected to
[03:07:39 - 03:07:42] mount sack starting with my
[03:07:42 - 03:07:45] mom who's in the other
[03:07:45 - 03:07:45] room she was a non-traditional
[03:07:50 - 03:07:50] student and uh was a
[03:07:50 - 03:07:53] housewife for 10 18 years
[03:07:53 - 03:07:53] or so and then decided
[03:07:53 - 03:07:55] to go back so it
[03:07:55 - 03:07:55] was between mount sack and
[03:07:55 - 03:07:58] citrus college and i was
[03:07:58 - 03:08:00] that little girl that would
[03:08:00 - 03:08:00] sit with her in class
[03:08:00 - 03:08:02] and get chips out of
[03:08:02 - 03:08:02] the vending machine and all
[03:08:06 - 03:08:06] of that so i witnessed
[03:08:06 - 03:08:08] how she gained empowerment and
[03:08:08 - 03:08:11] how she gained independence and
[03:08:11 - 03:08:13] also workplace skills that made
[03:08:13 - 03:08:17] a significant contribution to our
[03:08:17 - 03:08:17] household income and she later
[03:08:19 - 03:08:19] became a preschool teacher in
[03:08:19 - 03:08:21] basset and hassienda heights and
[03:08:21 - 03:08:26] is still subbing there to

[03:08:34 - 03:08:37] and then transferred to cal
[03:08:37 - 03:08:37] state la i have then
[03:08:37 - 03:08:39] gone on to earn several
[03:08:39 - 03:08:42] degrees including a doctoral degree

[03:10:21 - 03:10:24] an immigrant first generation esl
[03:10:24 - 03:10:25] student who didn't know how
[03:10:25 - 03:10:27] much she had to offer
[03:10:27 - 03:10:27] until she came to the
[03:10:27 - 03:10:29] community college when i got
[03:10:29 - 03:10:31] hired here i reflected on
[03:10:31 - 03:10:31] all the steps of my
[03:10:32 - 03:10:34] full circle journey and i
[03:10:34 - 03:10:37] truly allowed myself to feel
[03:10:37 - 03:10:39] proud which is not something
[03:10:39 - 03:10:39] i allowed myself to do
[03:10:39 - 03:10:41] often as an asian student
[03:10:41 - 03:10:43] growing up struggling with the
[03:10:43 - 03:10:46] pressures of the model minority
[03:10:46 - 03:10:46] myth now as a full-time
[03:10:48 - 03:10:48] faculty at mount sack i

[03:10:56 - 03:10:56] but to strive to become
[03:11:00 - 03:11:00] even more to be even
[03:11:00 - 03:11:02] better to be my students
[03:11:02 - 03:11:02] first point of contact to
[03:11:04 - 03:11:04] everything our school has to
[03:11:04 - 03:11:06] offer to be their safe
[03:11:06 - 03:11:06] space to be their point
[03:11:09 - 03:11:09] of access to intergenerational mentoring
[03:11:11 - 03:11:11] as i stand on the
[03:11:11 - 03:11:13] shoulders of my mentors and
[03:11:13 - 03:11:15] elevate my students even higher

[03:11:25 - 03:11:27] a job where the work
[03:11:27 - 03:11:27] is never finished but always

[03:13:10 - 03:13:12] at ucla and i have
[03:13:12 - 03:13:12] to say that out of
[03:13:12 - 03:13:14] all of these schools my
[03:13:14 - 03:13:14] students at mount sack have
[03:13:16 - 03:13:16] been the most engaged and
[03:13:16 - 03:13:19] warm and curious and enthusiastic
[03:13:19 - 03:13:21] about their learning i'm proud
[03:13:21 - 03:13:24] to introduce myself to you
[03:13:24 - 03:13:24] as the first and only
[03:13:24 - 03:13:26] for now professor of asian-american
[03:13:26 - 03:13:29] and pacific islander studies here
[03:13:29 - 03:13:31] at mount sack i come
[03:13:31 - 03:13:31] to you as a scholar
[03:13:31 - 03:13:33] of the field of asian-american
[03:13:33 - 03:13:33] studies for the past 11
[03:13:35 - 03:13:35] years who began my journey
[03:13:35 - 03:13:37] in ethnic studies at the
[03:13:37 - 03:13:39] college of william and mary
[03:13:39 - 03:13:39] in southern virginia which is
[03:13:39 - 03:13:41] my home state as a
[03:13:41 - 03:13:43] teenager and young adult i
[03:13:43 - 03:13:43] was part of a coalition
[03:13:43 - 03:13:45] of students and faculty members
[03:13:45 - 03:13:47] who created the field of
[03:13:47 - 03:13:50] asian and pacific islander american
[03:13:50 - 03:13:50] studies at my school in
[03:13:50 - 03:13:52] 2016 to create an academic
[03:13:52 - 03:13:54] home for an overlooked and
[03:13:54 - 03:13:56] underserved population of asian-americans and
[03:13:56 - 03:13:59] pacific islanders at our school
[03:13:59 - 03:14:01] asian-american studies helped to teach
[03:14:01 - 03:14:01] us that we belong and
[03:14:03 - 03:14:03] if that date sounds familiar
[03:14:03 - 03:14:05] to you all that's um
[03:14:05 - 03:14:05] you know this was essentially
[03:14:07 - 03:14:07] what connected me to mount
[03:14:07 - 03:14:09] sack and what made me
[03:14:09 - 03:14:09] know that this was the
[03:14:09 - 03:14:12] place for me um but
[03:14:12 - 03:14:12] in 2016 is when at
[03:14:12 - 03:14:14] mount sack the efforts to
[03:14:14 - 03:14:16] create ethnic studies began um
[03:14:16 - 03:14:16] so i feel very connected
[03:14:16 - 03:14:18] to the lineage here even
[03:14:18 - 03:14:20] though i was all the
[03:14:20 - 03:14:20] way across the country in
[03:14:20 - 03:14:22] southern virginia as a young
[03:14:22 - 03:14:25] brown south asian-american growing up
[03:14:25 - 03:14:27] in post 911 america asian-american
[03:14:27 - 03:14:29] studies helped me to understand
[03:14:29 - 03:14:31] my unique and often difficult
[03:14:31 - 03:14:33] racial position in this country
[03:14:33 - 03:14:33] as an instructor i feel
[03:14:35 - 03:14:35] blessed to impart this knowledge
[03:14:35 - 03:14:37] upon my students asian-american and
[03:14:37 - 03:14:39] pacific islander studies means learning
[03:14:40 - 03:14:41] the erased histories of significant
[03:14:43 - 03:14:43] communities in the united states
[03:14:44 - 03:14:46] and their ongoing lived experiences
[03:14:46 - 03:14:49] whether you're aapi or not
[03:14:49 - 03:14:51] for my mount sack students
[03:14:51 - 03:14:51] it means that i want
[03:14:51 - 03:14:53] them to not just learn
[03:14:53 - 03:14:55] about these erased histories but
[03:14:55 - 03:14:57] also to build solidarities and
[03:14:57 - 03:14:59] connections to the communities around
[03:14:59 - 03:15:01] us supporting and serving minoritized
[03:15:01 - 03:15:03] student populations has been at
[03:15:03 - 03:15:03] the core of my mission
[03:15:03 - 03:15:04] that i've undertaken since entering
[03:15:04 - 03:15:07] the workforce in 2017 in
[03:15:07 - 03:15:09] my roles as youth worker

[03:15:13 - 03:15:13] campaign i bring not only
[03:15:13 - 03:15:15] expertise in the content of
[03:15:15 - 03:15:17] asian-american and pacific islander studies
[03:15:17 - 03:15:19] but also the heart of
[03:15:19 - 03:15:21] community support and liberation which
[03:15:21 - 03:15:23] all translates to healing centered
[03:15:23 - 03:15:26] engagement that is central to
[03:15:26 - 03:15:26] ethnic studies and i also
[03:15:27 - 03:15:27] bring years of supporting youth
[03:15:27 - 03:15:29] and young adult populations as
[03:15:29 - 03:15:31] well as all ages learners
[03:15:31 - 03:15:31] that is so important when
[03:15:33 - 03:15:33] it comes to our mission

[03:25:46 - 03:25:49] mal uh a few of
[03:25:49 - 03:25:49] you may know me um
[03:25:49 - 03:25:52] i started here in 20
[03:25:52 - 03:25:52] in fall of 2023 and
[03:25:52 - 03:25:55] i graduated spring 2025 with
[03:25:55 - 03:25:57] my associates in fire technology
[03:25:57 - 03:25:58] and sociology and i'm currently
[03:25:58 - 03:25:58] a cal state long beach
[03:25:58 - 03:26:00] student majoring in healthcare administration
[03:26:03 - 03:26:03] with a minor in emergency
[03:26:03 - 03:26:05] management so public service has
[03:26:05 - 03:26:08] always been really big close
[03:26:08 - 03:26:08] and dear to my heart
[03:26:08 - 03:26:10] um and honestly like having
[03:26:10 - 03:26:12] transferred the one thing i
[03:26:12 - 03:26:12] can say about mount zach
[03:26:12 - 03:26:15] is like mount sack truly
[03:26:15 - 03:26:17] did care about me like
[03:26:17 - 03:26:17] especially now that i'm paying
[03:26:17 - 03:26:20] like 15 000 for a
[03:26:20 - 03:26:20] dorm room 630 for a
[03:26:23 - 03:26:23] year-long parking pass like it's
[03:26:23 - 03:26:24] a lot of money and
[03:26:24 - 03:26:24] at a big school big
[03:26:26 - 03:26:26] schools make it's really difficult
[03:26:26 - 03:26:28] for them to like in
[03:26:28 - 03:26:31] uh sorry to individualize their
[03:26:31 - 03:26:34] like care to each student
[03:26:34 - 03:26:34] that did really well right
[03:26:34 - 03:26:37] but um as a few
[03:26:37 - 03:26:37] of you guys may know
[03:26:37 - 03:26:39] i am also really big
[03:26:39 - 03:26:41] on advocating so wherever i
[03:26:41 - 03:26:41] see pitfalls i will make
[03:26:43 - 03:26:43] sure to call them out
[03:26:43 - 03:26:45] and the one thing that
[03:26:45 - 03:26:45] i will hold against mount
[03:26:45 - 03:26:48] sack is that although yes
[03:26:48 - 03:26:50] mount sack does truly care
[03:26:50 - 03:26:50] about its students mount sack
[03:26:50 - 03:26:52] can be doing a better
[03:26:52 - 03:26:54] job about listening to its
[03:26:54 - 03:26:54] students and i mean truly
[03:26:54 - 03:26:56] listening to their students asking
[03:26:56 - 03:26:58] the students what they want
[03:26:58 - 03:27:01] and then implementing that right
[03:27:01 - 03:27:01] so a great example of
[03:27:01 - 03:27:04] that is as we can
[03:27:04 - 03:27:07] see especially last semester with
[03:27:07 - 03:27:08] the um with the president's
[03:27:08 - 03:27:10] forums and the discussions about
[03:27:10 - 03:27:10] ar-15s it was brought to
[03:27:10 - 03:27:12] the board's attention and to
[03:27:12 - 03:27:14] the president's attention as well
[03:27:14 - 03:27:17] that the students want more
[03:27:17 - 03:27:17] want more housing support want
[03:27:19 - 03:27:19] more financial support want more
[03:27:19 - 03:27:22] uh want more basic needs
[03:27:22 - 03:27:25] period and what i've seen
[03:27:25 - 03:27:25] over the summer is that
[03:27:25 - 03:27:28] we moved forward with getting
[03:27:28 - 03:27:30] new police cars but we
[03:27:30 - 03:27:32] haven't moved forward with increasing
[03:27:32 - 03:27:32] the budget for basic needs
[03:27:34 - 03:27:34] right we haven't move forward
[03:27:34 - 03:27:37] with um trying to solve
[03:27:37 - 03:27:37] any of like the housing
[03:27:38 - 03:27:38] issues and i understand these
[03:27:38 - 03:27:41] are really big issues to
[03:27:41 - 03:27:42] solve these aren't like one
[03:27:42 - 03:27:42] community college is not going
[03:27:44 - 03:27:44] to solve the entire housing
[03:27:44 - 03:27:46] crisis in the united states
[03:27:46 - 03:27:46] but if we can make
[03:27:46 - 03:27:48] an effort to make our
[03:27:48 - 03:27:50] students feel heard that's really
[03:27:50 - 03:27:52] really important another major thing
[03:27:52 - 03:27:52] is in this day and
[03:27:52 - 03:27:54] age especially in this political
[03:27:54 - 03:27:57] climate we need we need
[03:27:57 - 03:27:57] to put more money and
[03:27:57 - 03:27:59] more just care and support
[03:27:59 - 03:28:02] into our ethnic studies programs
[03:28:02 - 03:28:04] they don't have a department
[03:28:04 - 03:28:04] budget right now they have
[03:28:06 - 03:28:06] i think only one or
[03:28:06 - 03:28:08] two full-time staff members they
[03:28:08 - 03:28:08] need more than that this
[03:28:10 - 03:28:10] is a growing department and
[03:28:10 - 03:28:12] a department that means quite
[03:28:12 - 03:28:12] a lot to the pe
[03:28:12 - 03:28:14] the students that you guys
[03:28:14 - 03:28:17] serve you guys primarily serve
[03:28:17 - 03:28:17] uh students of color so
[03:28:19 - 03:28:19] ethnic studies is a really
[03:28:19 - 03:28:21] big part of their life
[03:28:21 - 03:28:23] but that department doesn't even
[03:28:23 - 03:28:23] have its own budget to
[03:28:23 - 03:28:25] be able to support all
[03:28:25 - 03:28:27] these students so again it's
[03:28:27 - 03:28:27] just about listening to your
[03:28:29 - 03:28:29] students and again truly listening
[03:28:32 - 03:28:32] listening to what they want
[03:28:32 - 03:28:34] and as a board deciding
[03:28:34 - 03:28:34] what can we do what
[03:28:34 - 03:28:35] can we afford to do
[03:28:35 - 03:28:35] and how are we going
[03:28:35 - 03:28:38] to do it all that
[03:28:38 - 03:28:38] being said like i said
[03:28:39 - 03:28:39] i love mount sack i
[03:28:39 - 03:28:41] love mount zach so much
[03:28:41 - 03:28:41] that i am making the
[03:28:41 - 03:28:43] hourlong commute just to come
[03:28:43 - 03:28:45] work here instead of working
[03:28:45 - 03:28:45] in long beach so i
[03:28:45 - 03:28:47] really do love mount sack

[03:28:51 - 03:28:51] much next up is alan
[03:29:00 - 03:29:00] and then after allan will
[03:29:00 - 03:29:01] be uh caesar and then
[03:29:01 - 03:29:03] after allan will be uh
[03:29:03 - 03:29:06] caesar alvarado hello i talk
[03:29:06 - 03:29:06] a lot about the technology
[03:29:09 - 03:29:09] and our students rights that
[03:29:09 - 03:29:11] are being violated i just
[03:29:11 - 03:29:11] want to say there are
[03:29:12 - 03:29:12] solutions that would take a
[03:29:12 - 03:29:13] long time to talk about
[03:29:13 - 03:29:15] there's self-hosting there's proper encryption
[03:29:15 - 03:29:17] like publicly keyed cryptography between
[03:29:17 - 03:29:19] students and teachers there are
[03:29:19 - 03:29:19] applications with no teachers there
[03:29:19 - 03:29:21] are applications with no logs
[03:29:21 - 03:29:22] logs they're allowing companies to
[03:29:22 - 03:29:25] collect more data than they
[03:29:25 - 03:29:27] need on students is a
[03:29:27 - 03:29:27] security risk forcing students into
[03:29:29 - 03:29:29] legal agreements with corporations where
[03:29:31 - 03:29:31] they take our data and
[03:29:31 - 03:29:33] take our rights away is
[03:29:33 - 03:29:35] just horrible i think leadership
[03:29:35 - 03:29:35] should be liable and your
[03:29:36 - 03:29:36] wealth should be on the
[03:29:36 - 03:29:39] line if you're going to
[03:29:39 - 03:29:39] do this to us we
[03:29:39 - 03:29:40] use k16 anti-ai cheat cheat
[03:29:40 - 03:29:45] cheat cheat cheating which uses
[03:29:45 - 03:29:45] chat gpc or gpt0 sorry
[03:29:45 - 03:29:47] um in gpt0's own test
[03:29:47 - 03:29:47] they said own text they
[03:29:49 - 03:29:49] say the nature of ai
[03:29:49 - 03:29:52] generated content is changing constantly
[03:29:52 - 03:29:53] as such these results should
[03:29:53 - 03:29:53] not be used to punish
[03:29:55 - 03:29:55] students which they are they
[03:29:55 - 03:29:57] are always existing on there
[03:29:57 - 03:29:59] are always existing edge cases
[03:29:59 - 03:30:01] cases with both instances where
[03:30:01 - 03:30:01] ai is classified as human
[03:30:01 - 03:30:05] and human is classified as
[03:30:05 - 03:30:06] ai james o'brien professor of
[03:30:06 - 03:30:08] computer science berkeley has some
[03:30:08 - 03:30:08] questions questions that i have
[03:30:10 - 03:30:10] quoted is a student or
[03:30:10 - 03:30:11] parent or the parent of
[03:30:11 - 03:30:11] the student someone with the
[03:30:13 - 03:30:13] english a second language if
[03:30:13 - 03:30:15] yes there are there may
[03:30:15 - 03:30:17] be a discrimination aspect to
[03:30:17 - 03:30:17] the case people with english
[03:30:17 - 03:30:19] a second language often directly
[03:30:19 - 03:30:21] translate idioms or other common
[03:30:21 - 03:30:22] phrases and expressions from their
[03:30:22 - 03:30:25] first language the resulting text
[03:30:25 - 03:30:26] ends up with unusual phrases
[03:30:26 - 03:30:26] that are known to falsely
[03:30:29 - 03:30:29] trigger ai detectors if the
[03:30:29 - 03:30:31] student is a member of
[03:30:31 - 03:30:31] a minority group that makes
[03:30:33 - 03:30:33] use of these of use
[03:30:33 - 03:30:35] of their own idioms or
[03:30:35 - 03:30:35] english dialect as with a
[03:30:35 - 03:30:37] second language speaker these these
[03:30:37 - 03:30:39] these less common phrases can
[03:30:39 - 03:30:42] falsely trigger ai detectors is
[03:30:42 - 03:30:44] is the student accused neurodeiverse
[03:30:44 - 03:30:44] if yes then this is
[03:30:46 - 03:30:48] another possible discrimination aspect to
[03:30:48 - 03:30:48] the case people with autism
[03:30:48 - 03:30:51] for example may use expressions
[03:30:51 - 03:30:53] that make perfect sense to
[03:30:53 - 03:30:55] them but that others find
[03:30:55 - 03:30:55] odd there is nothing wrong
[03:30:55 - 03:30:57] with these expressions but they
[03:30:57 - 03:30:59] are they are unusual and
[03:30:59 - 03:31:01] ai detectors can be triggered
[03:31:01 - 03:31:01] by them we are paying
[03:31:01 - 03:31:03] these companies that are profiting
[03:31:03 - 03:31:05] profiting off of our student
[03:31:05 - 03:31:08] data and work also doing
[03:31:08 - 03:31:08] false student false assessments on
[03:31:11 - 03:31:11] students that are violating many
[03:31:11 - 03:31:14] student rights and most of
[03:31:14 - 03:31:16] our leadership hasn't acknowledged how
[03:31:16 - 03:31:18] surveillance technology erodess these rights
[03:31:20 - 03:31:20] i have a lot more
[03:31:20 - 03:31:20] to talk about but i
[03:31:23 - 03:31:23] can't do it justice right
[03:31:23 - 03:31:26] now so that that will
[03:31:26 - 03:31:26] be i think supporting mass
[03:31:30 - 03:31:30] surveillance of our students shows
[03:31:30 - 03:31:33] that these that the leadership
[03:31:33 - 03:31:36] is not fit to be
[03:31:36 - 03:31:36] serving in the education sector
[03:31:37 - 03:31:40] thank you thank you very
[03:31:40 - 03:31:40] much and next up is
[03:31:43 - 03:31:46] caesar alvarado hey how are
[03:31:46 - 03:31:48] you welcome i'm doing great
[03:31:48 - 03:31:52] i don't think i've ever
[03:31:52 - 03:31:52] sat in this chair before
[03:31:52 - 03:31:53] but welcome you have three
[03:31:53 - 03:31:56] minutes thank you very much
[03:31:59 - 03:31:59] good evening dr garcia trustees
[03:32:02 - 03:32:02] members of the das and
[03:32:02 - 03:32:04] campus community for anyone who
[03:32:04 - 03:32:04] doesn't know my name is
[03:32:07 - 03:32:07] cesat latan vado and i'm
[03:32:07 - 03:32:09] here today to call on
[03:32:09 - 03:32:11] this institution to follow through
[03:32:11 - 03:32:11] on some of its commitments
[03:32:11 - 03:32:13] to take bold and necessary
[03:32:13 - 03:32:16] steps toward justice and equity
[03:32:18 - 03:32:18] first i would like the
[03:32:18 - 03:32:21] board to begin the process
[03:32:21 - 03:32:21] of renaming our college from
[03:32:24 - 03:32:24] mount san antonio college or
[03:32:24 - 03:32:26] mount sack to mount yoat
[03:32:29 - 03:32:29] names carry weight and this
[03:32:29 - 03:32:32] current name reflects a colonial
[03:32:32 - 03:32:35] legacy that erases original peoples
[03:32:35 - 03:32:38] languages and cultures of this
[03:32:38 - 03:32:41] land by embracing mount yoat
[03:32:41 - 03:32:41] we not only just change
[03:32:41 - 03:32:44] a name but we acknowledge
[03:32:44 - 03:32:47] history honor indigenous roots and
[03:32:47 - 03:32:47] take steps toward indigenous roots
[03:32:47 - 03:32:49] and take steps toward decolonization
[03:32:49 - 03:32:51] decolonization i understand that this
[03:32:51 - 03:32:53] is a difficult conversation but
[03:32:53 - 03:32:56] i understand as well that
[03:32:56 - 03:32:56] it benefits all of us
[03:32:56 - 03:32:59] it fosters a stronger sense
[03:32:59 - 03:33:01] of belonging strengthens community trust
[03:33:01 - 03:33:04] and shows our students and
[03:33:04 - 03:33:04] neighbors that we are unafraid
[03:33:04 - 03:33:06] to lead by example in
[03:33:06 - 03:33:10] creating a more inclusive and
[03:33:10 - 03:33:12] truthful future second i would
[03:33:12 - 03:33:12] like to ask the board
[03:33:12 - 03:33:14] to address another urgent need
[03:33:14 - 03:33:17] in our student community mental
[03:33:17 - 03:33:19] health and psychiatric care while
[03:33:19 - 03:33:23] our college provides some health
[03:33:23 - 03:33:26] services we lack dedicated psychiatrists
[03:33:26 - 03:33:28] and on-ampusies neurodeivergent students and
[03:33:28 - 03:33:29] those living with mental health
[03:33:29 - 03:33:32] conditions often face months long
[03:33:32 - 03:33:34] waits and significant financial barriers
[03:33:34 - 03:33:39] when seeking care this gap
[03:33:39 - 03:33:42] directly impacts our students ability
[03:33:42 - 03:33:44] to succeed by hiring dedicated
[03:33:44 - 03:33:46] psychiatrists and implementing pharmacies within
[03:33:46 - 03:33:48] our health centers things that
[03:33:48 - 03:33:51] have already been done by
[03:33:51 - 03:33:51] around 50 of the csu
[03:33:53 - 03:33:53] system our college could be
[03:33:53 - 03:33:56] the first in our system
[03:33:56 - 03:33:58] to provide lifesaving care reduce
[03:33:58 - 03:34:01] barriers to medication access and
[03:34:01 - 03:34:03] create pathways for more students
[03:34:03 - 03:34:03] to graduate and transfer the
[03:34:05 - 03:34:05] research is clear when students
[03:34:06 - 03:34:08] mental health needs are met
[03:34:08 - 03:34:11] retention graduation and transfer rates
[03:34:11 - 03:34:14] all rise this is both
[03:34:14 - 03:34:14] a moral and practical call
[03:34:17 - 03:34:17] to action renaming our institution
[03:34:17 - 03:34:19] to mount yoat and expanding
[03:34:19 - 03:34:21] psychiatric services are not separate
[03:34:21 - 03:34:24] goals but they are both
[03:34:24 - 03:34:26] steps toward building a college
[03:34:26 - 03:34:26] that is inclusive just and
[03:34:28 - 03:34:28] supportive of every student thank
[03:34:28 - 03:34:31] you for your time and
[03:34:31 - 03:34:33] for your leadership and i

[03:38:08 - 03:38:08] appreciative of that and we
[03:38:08 - 03:38:10] look forward to continue to
[03:38:10 - 03:38:14] work on those issues in
[03:38:14 - 03:38:18] the coming process in terms
[03:38:18 - 03:38:18] of the budget for the
[03:38:18 - 03:38:21] 2526 year um we do
[03:38:21 - 03:38:21] see that that is on
[03:38:21 - 03:38:24] your agenda this evening for
[03:38:24 - 03:38:27] approval and i know it's
[03:38:27 - 03:38:27] going to go through um
[03:38:27 - 03:38:30] what is concerning to us
[03:38:30 - 03:38:32] is to see the college
[03:38:32 - 03:38:32] once again predicts an ongoing
[03:38:36 - 03:38:36] budget deficit for the college
[03:38:36 - 03:38:40] we see year after year
[03:38:40 - 03:38:40] that we um the ending
[03:38:43 - 03:38:43] balance continues to grow and
[03:38:43 - 03:38:45] for several years we have
[03:38:45 - 03:38:49] exceeded board policy 6250's requirement
[03:38:49 - 03:38:53] to have an ending balance
[03:38:53 - 03:38:55] over 18 5 so i
[03:38:55 - 03:38:55] just want to share that
[03:38:55 - 03:38:57] faculty members will question narratives
[03:38:57 - 03:39:00] that our college faces financial
[03:39:00 - 03:39:03] challenges and we are here
[03:39:03 - 03:39:03] to work with you to
[03:39:05 - 03:39:08] continue prioritizing the learning environment
[03:39:08 - 03:39:08] for our students and that
[03:39:10 - 03:39:10] includes the faculty and staff
[03:39:10 - 03:39:13] that make learning possible for
[03:39:13 - 03:39:16] our students as well as
[03:39:16 - 03:39:16] some of our community members
[03:39:18 - 03:39:18] and then lastly we have
[03:39:18 - 03:39:21] some upcoming events that we
[03:39:21 - 03:39:21] hope you will join us
[03:39:24 - 03:39:24] um one of them is
[03:39:24 - 03:39:27] an adjunct faculty celebration that
[03:39:27 - 03:39:29] is scheduled on october 21st
[03:39:29 - 03:39:29] and this is an event
[03:39:29 - 03:39:32] where departments recognize adjuncts and
[03:39:32 - 03:39:35] we are also celebrating milestone
[03:39:35 - 03:39:36] years so we have adjuncts
[03:39:36 - 03:39:39] that have been here many
[03:39:39 - 03:39:39] many years and we are
[03:39:39 - 03:39:40] taking that opportunity to celebrate
[03:39:40 - 03:39:43] those accomplishments so october 21st

[03:41:19 - 03:41:20] in this year has been
[03:41:20 - 03:41:21] a turning point in negotiations
[03:41:21 - 03:41:23] negotiations just today the last

[03:41:26 - 03:41:30] csea's 610 ratification process together

[03:41:30 - 03:41:33] three of the most urgent
[03:41:33 - 03:41:35] challenges facing our members outdated
[03:41:35 - 03:41:37] job descriptions unsustainable workloads and
[03:41:40 - 03:41:42] insufficient compensation we have also
[03:41:42 - 03:41:42] seen a welcome shift in
[03:41:44 - 03:41:44] approach between csea and the
[03:41:44 - 03:41:45] approach between csea and the
[03:41:45 - 03:41:48] administration administration president garcia recently
[03:41:48 - 03:41:50] extended an invitation for improved
[03:41:50 - 03:41:53] communication and i want to
[03:41:53 - 03:41:55] thank her for that strong
[03:41:55 - 03:41:58] communication is the foundation of
[03:41:58 - 03:42:00] any healthy relationship while challenges
[03:42:00 - 03:42:02] are inevitable open dialogue gives
[03:42:02 - 03:42:02] us the mean to o
[03:42:02 - 03:42:05] the means to overcome them
[03:42:05 - 03:42:06] together recent interactions give us
[03:42:06 - 03:42:09] real hope that this door
[03:42:09 - 03:42:09] is opening wider and we
[03:42:09 - 03:42:09] are door is opening wider
[03:42:10 - 03:42:10] and we are grateful grateful
[03:42:13 - 03:42:13] president garcia has also voiced
[03:42:13 - 03:42:15] her support for our members
[03:42:15 - 03:42:18] who need relief from heavy
[03:42:18 - 03:42:20] workloads our recent agreements commit
[03:42:20 - 03:42:23] the district to meet with
[03:42:23 - 03:42:23] us to identify areas most
[03:42:23 - 03:42:25] in need but her commitment
[03:42:25 - 03:42:28] has gone further even before
[03:42:28 - 03:42:29] that agreement takes effect she
[03:42:29 - 03:42:29] invited us to share our
[03:42:29 - 03:42:31] data with her cabinet to
[03:42:31 - 03:42:34] guide new staffing allocations she
[03:42:34 - 03:42:35] also expressed a willingness to
[03:42:35 - 03:42:37] partner with us on messaging
[03:42:37 - 03:42:37] to encourage a healthier work
[03:42:40 - 03:42:42] culture across campus i also
[03:42:42 - 03:42:42] want to acknowledge the district
[03:42:45 - 03:42:45] negotiating team and human resources
[03:42:47 - 03:42:47] this has been a challenging
[03:42:47 - 03:42:49] year due to the diff
[03:42:49 - 03:42:52] the distance between our positions
[03:42:52 - 03:42:54] at the bargaining table despite
[03:42:54 - 03:42:54] that the district's team acted
[03:42:57 - 03:42:57] with professionalism and respect i
[03:42:58 - 03:42:58] believe our strong working relationship
[03:43:01 - 03:43:01] with human resources prevented tensions
[03:43:03 - 03:43:03] from escalating we are grateful
[03:43:03 - 03:43:05] for that partnership and i
[03:43:05 - 03:43:07] believe we are leaving this
[03:43:07 - 03:43:07] year in a far better
[03:43:07 - 03:43:10] place than where we began
[03:43:10 - 03:43:13] special thanks as well to
[03:43:13 - 03:43:13] soa tika and alexis for
[03:43:13 - 03:43:14] their leadership in improving our
[03:43:16 - 03:43:16] classification and reclassification classification and
[03:43:17 - 03:43:19] reclassification processes processes while negotiations
[03:43:19 - 03:43:22] are still underway the progress
[03:43:22 - 03:43:22] we've made in the class
[03:43:22 - 03:43:25] and reclass committee and at
[03:43:25 - 03:43:27] the table has been substantial
[03:43:27 - 03:43:28] for the first time in
[03:43:29 - 03:43:29] many years we see a
[03:43:29 - 03:43:31] clear path to ensuring our
[03:43:31 - 03:43:35] job descriptions are finally brought
[03:43:35 - 03:43:35] up to date csea is
[03:43:36 - 03:43:36] grateful for the agreements we've
[03:43:38 - 03:43:38] reached this year but i
[03:43:38 - 03:43:41] want to be clear these
[03:43:41 - 03:43:41] agreements are not a gift
[03:43:43 - 03:43:43] they represent fair compensation that
[03:43:45 - 03:43:45] our members have long deserved
[03:43:45 - 03:43:47] our members need these terms
[03:43:47 - 03:43:49] to best support the students
[03:43:49 - 03:43:49] we serve and to ensure
[03:43:51 - 03:43:51] mount sack can continue to
[03:43:51 - 03:43:53] attract and retain the dedicated
[03:43:53 - 03:43:56] classified professionals who make this
[03:43:56 - 03:43:58] campus run after years of
[03:43:58 - 03:44:00] deferrals we are proud to
[03:44:00 - 03:44:00] have finally secured agreements that
[03:44:03 - 03:44:03] make progress towards both fairness
[03:44:03 - 03:44:04] and highlighting the essential role
[03:44:04 - 03:44:05] of our highlighting the essential
[03:44:05 - 03:44:06] role of our members members
[03:44:09 - 03:44:09] that said our work is
[03:44:09 - 03:44:11] not finished in the months
[03:44:11 - 03:44:13] ahead csea will begin preparing
[03:44:13 - 03:44:15] for next year's negotiations we
[03:44:15 - 03:44:15] will survey our members directly
[03:44:17 - 03:44:17] about pay and working conditions
[03:44:17 - 03:44:19] to allow their responses to
[03:44:19 - 03:44:22] drive our proposals at the
[03:44:22 - 03:44:23] table we will also conduct
[03:44:23 - 03:44:23] an in-depth review of the
[03:44:25 - 03:44:25] district's financials to ensure we
[03:44:26 - 03:44:28] come to the table informed
[03:44:30 - 03:44:30] we recognize that financial constraints
[03:44:32 - 03:44:32] are real and money does
[03:44:32 - 03:44:35] not appear from nowhere csea
[03:44:35 - 03:44:36] is committed to hearing and
[03:44:36 - 03:44:38] understanding the district's perspective and
[03:44:38 - 03:44:40] to approaching the conversation collaboratively
[03:44:40 - 03:44:42] but we also want to
[03:44:42 - 03:44:44] recognize that budgets are about
[03:44:44 - 03:44:44] priorities and we hope whatever
[03:44:47 - 03:44:47] the financial circumstances may be
[03:44:47 - 03:44:49] that the district will continue
[03:44:49 - 03:44:51] to prioritize the one and

[03:49:53 - 03:49:53] item 8 05 academic senate
[03:49:56 - 03:49:59] dr tanya anders welcome good
[03:49:59 - 03:49:59] evening board members dr garcia
[03:50:00 - 03:50:00] good to be here i'm
[03:50:00 - 03:50:03] going to talk to you
[03:50:03 - 03:50:03] about four things today um
[03:50:03 - 03:50:03] dual you about four things
[03:50:04 - 03:50:05] today um dual enrollment enrollment
[03:50:08 - 03:50:08] our senate structure and then
[03:50:08 - 03:50:10] appendix e positions as well
[03:50:10 - 03:50:13] as faculty hiring so regarding
[03:50:13 - 03:50:13] dual enrollment um the senate
[03:50:15 - 03:50:15] has been advocating for a
[03:50:15 - 03:50:17] dual enrollment faculty leaison position
[03:50:17 - 03:50:18] we used to have one
[03:50:18 - 03:50:18] and then we lost it
[03:50:20 - 03:50:20] dual enrollment is growing across
[03:50:20 - 03:50:23] the state part of vision
[03:50:23 - 03:50:25] 2030 and so we felt
[03:50:25 - 03:50:25] there was really a strong
[03:50:25 - 03:50:27] need to have a person
[03:50:27 - 03:50:29] that would link our departments
[03:50:29 - 03:50:29] and divisions with the dual
[03:50:31 - 03:50:31] enrollment team here within on
[03:50:31 - 03:50:33] our campus within student services
[03:50:33 - 03:50:36] but then also with the
[03:50:36 - 03:50:38] local school district so we're
[03:50:38 - 03:50:38] launching a pilot and with
[03:50:38 - 03:50:41] some release time for a
[03:50:41 - 03:50:43] faculty member who will have
[03:50:43 - 03:50:43] a number of key tasks
[03:50:43 - 03:50:46] that i listed here for
[03:50:46 - 03:50:46] you in the report and
[03:50:46 - 03:50:49] i did a call out
[03:50:49 - 03:50:49] and received a lot of
[03:50:51 - 03:50:51] applications which was amazing i
[03:50:51 - 03:50:53] had 20 faculty express interest
[03:50:53 - 03:50:57] in serving in the role
[03:50:57 - 03:50:57] um we had selection criteria
[03:50:58 - 03:50:58] that included experience teaching in
[03:51:00 - 03:51:00] dual enrollment potentially teaching at
[03:51:02 - 03:51:02] k through 12 system leadership
[03:51:04 - 03:51:07] experience curriculum experience and other
[03:51:07 - 03:51:07] things and so we narrowed
[03:51:07 - 03:51:10] it down to um a
[03:51:10 - 03:51:10] final candidate who will be
[03:51:13 - 03:51:13] appointed at senate exec tomorrow
[03:51:13 - 03:51:14] and then at full senate
[03:51:14 - 03:51:16] the week after and then
[03:51:16 - 03:51:16] we're looking forward to starting
[03:51:19 - 03:51:19] off the work in collaboration
[03:51:19 - 03:51:21] with um student services so
[03:51:21 - 03:51:25] really happy about that um
[03:51:25 - 03:51:25] last spring at the last
[03:51:25 - 03:51:27] senate meeting we approved a
[03:51:27 - 03:51:29] new senate committee and council
[03:51:29 - 03:51:32] structure that we worked on
[03:51:32 - 03:51:32] for a long time and
[03:51:32 - 03:51:34] so we eliminated a few
[03:51:34 - 03:51:36] committees added some new ones
[03:51:36 - 03:51:36] and so now is the
[03:51:36 - 03:51:37] first semester where we're really
[03:51:37 - 03:51:41] fully launching that so um
[03:51:41 - 03:51:43] you i added for you
[03:51:43 - 03:51:43] the the infographic here i
[03:51:43 - 03:51:45] guess you could call it
[03:51:45 - 03:51:47] our flowchart of the senate
[03:51:47 - 03:51:47] committees and councils that we
[03:51:51 - 03:51:51] have is you know we
[03:51:51 - 03:51:53] have three um well we
[03:51:53 - 03:51:53] have the 10 plus one
[03:51:53 - 03:51:55] three primary areas as i
[03:51:55 - 03:51:57] always say curriculum professional development
[03:51:57 - 03:51:59] and student preparation success that's
[03:51:59 - 03:52:01] why we have three councils
[03:52:01 - 03:52:01] that's what you see at
[03:52:03 - 03:52:03] the top there and then
[03:52:03 - 03:52:05] committee serving underneath so we're
[03:52:05 - 03:52:09] excited to get that going
[03:52:09 - 03:52:09] um and um faculty and
[03:52:09 - 03:52:12] others from across campus collaborating
[03:52:12 - 03:52:15] with us on those senate
[03:52:15 - 03:52:15] committees um so the two
[03:52:18 - 03:52:18] items that i am seeking
[03:52:18 - 03:52:21] your support with um one
[03:52:21 - 03:52:21] is our negotiation cycle in
[03:52:24 - 03:52:24] appendix e position so for
[03:52:24 - 03:52:25] example that um dual enrollment
[03:52:25 - 03:52:26] lea is on right now
[03:52:27 - 03:52:27] is a pilot but we're
[03:52:27 - 03:52:29] hoping at some point that
[03:52:29 - 03:52:29] position would be in our
[03:52:31 - 03:52:31] contract in appendix e and
[03:52:31 - 03:52:33] i listed a whole bunch
[03:52:33 - 03:52:33] of other positions that are
[03:52:36 - 03:52:36] in appendix e that allow
[03:52:36 - 03:52:38] faculty to step away from
[03:52:38 - 03:52:38] some of the teaching to
[03:52:38 - 03:52:40] help fulfill these important roles
[03:52:40 - 03:52:43] of serving our college so
[03:52:43 - 03:52:45] for example again think about
[03:52:45 - 03:52:45] the 10 plus one our
[03:52:45 - 03:52:47] curriculum le is on our
[03:52:47 - 03:52:51] professional development coordinator and so
[03:52:51 - 03:52:53] forth um we are always
[03:52:53 - 03:52:53] so late in negotiating our
[03:52:55 - 03:52:55] contract that i can't as
[03:52:55 - 03:52:57] senate president appoint people until
[03:52:57 - 03:53:00] we know well what what
[03:53:00 - 03:53:00] do we have what positions
[03:53:02 - 03:53:02] do we have and ideally
[03:53:02 - 03:53:04] we would appoint during the
[03:53:04 - 03:53:04] spring semester so that the
[03:53:07 - 03:53:07] faculty know this upcoming academic
[03:53:08 - 03:53:10] year say i have three
[03:53:10 - 03:53:10] l release time i don't
[03:53:12 - 03:53:12] need to teach one i
[03:53:12 - 03:53:13] can teach one class less
[03:53:13 - 03:53:13] and make room for a
[03:53:13 - 03:53:16] part-time faculty to teach that
[03:53:16 - 03:53:19] class and so that system
[03:53:19 - 03:53:19] is in a way broken
[03:53:19 - 03:53:21] for a long time we
[03:53:21 - 03:53:21] our contracts have gone through
[03:53:24 - 03:53:24] too late so what we're
[03:53:24 - 03:53:27] asking that may be a
[03:53:27 - 03:53:29] consideration for upcoming rounds of
[03:53:29 - 03:53:29] negotiations that maybe appendix e
[03:53:33 - 03:53:33] gets negotiated first so that
[03:53:33 - 03:53:35] we have that information so
[03:53:35 - 03:53:37] for example right now we're
[03:53:37 - 03:53:37] waiting for a desa plus
[03:53:39 - 03:53:39] coordinator to be appointed and
[03:53:39 - 03:53:41] if our contract goes through
[03:53:41 - 03:53:44] and we have that position
[03:53:44 - 03:53:44] then that person will now
[03:53:44 - 03:53:46] start working probably week five
[03:53:46 - 03:53:48] or six into the semester
[03:53:48 - 03:53:49] rather than with the beginning
[03:53:49 - 03:53:49] of the semester so we're
[03:53:51 - 03:53:51] asking for you to advocate
[03:53:51 - 03:53:54] for us if you can
[03:53:54 - 03:53:54] with the negotiation teams that
[03:53:57 - 03:53:57] would help us and then
[03:53:57 - 03:53:58] the other area where we're
[03:53:58 - 03:53:58] asking for your support is
[03:54:01 - 03:54:01] the hiring of faculty we
[03:54:01 - 03:54:03] will be entering the new
[03:54:03 - 03:54:06] cycle which is always exciting
[03:54:06 - 03:54:06] and may i say what
[03:54:06 - 03:54:09] an amazing group of faculty
[03:54:09 - 03:54:12] we are onboarding again amazing
[03:54:12 - 03:54:14] just absolutely amazing so many
[03:54:14 - 03:54:16] talented people and we're excited
[03:54:16 - 03:54:16] to get to know them
[03:54:16 - 03:54:19] better um so we would
[03:54:19 - 03:54:19] love to have a larger
[03:54:19 - 03:54:22] group of faculty to be
[03:54:22 - 03:54:22] hired we had two small
[03:54:25 - 03:54:25] hiring rounds seven in the
[03:54:25 - 03:54:27] last i know that expanded
[03:54:27 - 03:54:27] to 10 but originally was
[03:54:29 - 03:54:29] seven and then nine in
[03:54:29 - 03:54:31] the year before but we
[03:54:31 - 03:54:31] have a much larger group
[03:54:31 - 03:54:35] of retirees i over 20
[03:54:35 - 03:54:37] people retired plus we have
[03:54:37 - 03:54:40] we're helping with the growth
[03:54:40 - 03:54:40] we have enrollment growth uh
[03:54:40 - 03:54:43] we even have um some
[03:54:43 - 03:54:46] departments that are now way
[03:54:46 - 03:54:46] under we have some departments
[03:54:47 - 03:54:47] with one full-time faculty they're
[03:54:50 - 03:54:50] supposed to have three to
[03:54:50 - 03:54:53] be department so um we
[03:54:53 - 03:54:53] are asking you to please
[03:54:55 - 03:54:55] advocate for more faculty full-time
[03:54:58 - 03:54:58] faculty positions we have under
[03:54:58 - 03:55:00] 450 right now we have
[03:55:00 - 03:55:02] over 1 800 adjunct faculty
[03:55:02 - 03:55:02] there's clearly a need for
[03:55:02 - 03:55:04] more full-time faculty and we
[03:55:04 - 03:55:07] would love to have your
[03:55:07 - 03:55:07] support and finally i want

[04:01:03 - 04:01:14] trusty santos um this is
[04:01:14 - 04:01:18] a discussion item the question
[04:01:18 - 04:01:18] is um dr garcia trustee
[04:01:21 - 04:01:21] santos wants to know what
[04:01:21 - 04:01:26] would be the process to
[04:01:26 - 04:01:26] modify the the existing board
[04:01:28 - 04:01:28] compensation or all board the
[04:01:28 - 04:01:32] student trustee as well yeah
[04:01:32 - 04:01:32] everybody just changed this to
[04:01:34 - 04:01:36] from 750 to 780 to
[04:01:36 - 04:01:36] change this from 750 so
[04:01:36 - 04:01:41] you're saying 5 equals 780
[04:01:41 - 04:01:43] what what are the i
[04:01:43 - 04:01:43] i need direction from the
[04:01:43 - 04:01:46] board i'll modify the board
[04:01:46 - 04:01:48] policy bring it back for
[04:01:48 - 04:01:48] a first reading and then
[04:01:48 - 04:01:53] a final action and that
[04:01:53 - 04:01:53] would be the process to
[04:01:57 - 04:01:57] to mod to modify it
[04:01:57 - 04:02:00] and uh proceed if the
[04:02:00 - 04:02:00] board approves uh proceed if
[04:02:00 - 04:02:00] the board approves so so
[04:02:02 - 04:02:02] the first step is direction
[04:02:02 - 04:02:04] from the board if there's
[04:02:04 - 04:02:09] consensus to modify it and
[04:02:09 - 04:02:09] um you are able by
[04:02:09 - 04:02:11] action to increase the compensation
[04:02:11 - 04:02:14] for the board by 5
[04:02:16 - 04:02:16] if you choose to do
[04:02:16 - 04:02:21] so just one time yeah
[04:02:21 - 04:02:21] has it ever been increased
[04:02:24 - 04:02:25] it is uh director nelson
[04:02:28 - 04:02:28] no because you're at the
[04:02:28 - 04:02:30] max for our size district
[04:02:34 - 04:02:34] so uh it's my understanding
[04:02:34 - 04:02:36] that um the community college
[04:02:36 - 04:02:39] districts that that are as
[04:02:39 - 04:02:39] large as ours our maximum
[04:02:43 - 04:02:43] at this point is 750
[04:02:43 - 04:02:46] a month however correct the
[04:02:46 - 04:02:46] board has is allowed by
[04:02:46 - 04:02:50] law to increase it 5
[04:02:50 - 04:02:50] is it every year we
[04:02:53 - 04:02:53] are allowed to increase it
[04:02:53 - 04:02:57] 5 every year if the
[04:02:57 - 04:02:57] board so chooses the 5
[04:02:57 - 04:03:01] in this case as trustee
[04:03:01 - 04:03:05] santos has indicated is that
[04:03:05 - 04:03:16] correct um vice president 787
[04:03:16 - 04:03:16] would be the actual amount
[04:03:19 - 04:03:19] so that we're in discussion
[04:03:19 - 04:03:20] trustee so that we're in
[04:03:20 - 04:03:23] discussion trustee algo algo i
[04:03:23 - 04:03:23] would say that we i
[04:03:23 - 04:03:25] mean preferably i would prefer
[04:03:25 - 04:03:26] to have that conversation at
[04:03:26 - 04:03:26] a different time right now
[04:03:26 - 04:03:29] i just feel like this
[04:03:29 - 04:03:31] is for student trustee compensation
[04:03:31 - 04:03:31] so i i mean i'd
[04:03:31 - 04:03:33] be willing to entertain that
[04:03:33 - 04:03:36] conversation but for purposes of
[04:03:36 - 04:03:36] this agenda item i think
[04:03:38 - 04:03:38] it's important that we just
[04:03:38 - 04:03:40] do the student trustee compensation
[04:03:43 - 04:03:43] and look at other models
[04:03:43 - 04:03:44] at a different you know
[04:03:44 - 04:03:44] maybe at another board you
[04:03:44 - 04:03:44] know maybe at another board
[04:03:44 - 04:03:47] meeting meeting well well we
[04:03:47 - 04:03:49] had the the comparative last
[04:03:49 - 04:03:49] time at the first meeting
[04:03:49 - 04:03:50] we already had the comparatives
[04:03:53 - 04:03:53] so we don't we don't
[04:03:53 - 04:03:55] um when employee groups get
[04:03:55 - 04:03:55] a raise that doesn't apply
[04:03:57 - 04:03:57] to the board then that's
[04:03:57 - 04:03:57] not in our to the
[04:03:57 - 04:03:57] board then that's not in
[04:03:57 - 04:04:02] our bylaws bylaws okay so
[04:04:02 - 04:04:04] we're just flat okay trusty
[04:04:04 - 04:04:07] chow i i'd rather decline
[04:04:07 - 04:04:09] this this raise i think
[04:04:09 - 04:04:09] this is the best lowpaying
[04:04:09 - 04:04:13] job i've ever had and
[04:04:13 - 04:04:13] i i'm in it for
[04:04:13 - 04:04:19] the service and the uh
[04:04:19 - 04:04:19] seeing our success in our
[04:04:19 - 04:04:22] students and i feel the
[04:04:22 - 04:04:27] meals are outstanding okay so
[04:04:27 - 04:04:27] i would say i'm okay
[04:04:27 - 04:04:28] with the pay as it
[04:04:28 - 04:04:30] is all right would you

[04:06:36 - 04:06:36] of the old asphalt excavation
[04:06:36 - 04:06:39] putting the dirt back new
[04:06:39 - 04:06:41] concrete but it also includes
[04:06:41 - 04:06:47] sight lighting and outdoor furniture
[04:06:47 - 04:06:47] and some uh student focused
[04:06:47 - 04:06:52] um electrical components do do
[04:06:52 - 04:06:52] you have a rendering that
[04:06:52 - 04:06:52] we could do do you
[04:06:52 - 04:06:53] have a rendering that we
[04:06:53 - 04:06:56] could see see yeah we
[04:06:56 - 04:06:56] have a a full design
[04:06:56 - 04:06:57] that has been bid out
[04:06:57 - 04:07:00] we're reviewing those bids right
[04:07:00 - 04:07:00] now could could somebody pull
[04:07:00 - 04:07:02] it up for us to
[04:07:02 - 04:07:03] look at i don't think
[04:07:03 - 04:07:03] we have that right at
[04:07:03 - 04:07:13] this moment uh the the
[04:07:13 - 04:07:15] large cost component mostly most
[04:07:15 - 04:07:15] likely it's it's the site
[04:07:15 - 04:07:16] most likely it's it's the
[04:07:16 - 04:07:18] site preparation preparation there's a
[04:07:18 - 04:07:20] lot of asphalt there's asphalt
[04:07:20 - 04:07:20] up against the the embankment
[04:07:20 - 04:07:23] to the north right below
[04:07:23 - 04:07:25] uh building 16 does it
[04:07:25 - 04:07:26] involve environmental mitigation or anything
[04:07:26 - 04:07:29] that uh no no there's
[04:07:29 - 04:07:31] a retaining wall that will
[04:07:31 - 04:07:31] be installed at the north
[04:07:31 - 04:07:34] because of the tiered everything
[04:07:34 - 04:07:36] at mount sack is uphill
[04:07:39 - 04:07:39] so is the rendering on
[04:07:39 - 04:07:41] our website i don't believe
[04:07:41 - 04:07:41] it's been put on our
[04:07:42 - 04:07:44] construction website we we can
[04:07:44 - 04:07:44] get you a copy of
[04:07:44 - 04:07:44] the we we can get
[04:07:44 - 04:07:44] you a copy of the
[04:07:45 - 04:07:46] rendering rendering what what portion
[04:07:46 - 04:07:46] of the total cost is
[04:07:46 - 04:07:47] what what portion of the
[04:07:48 - 04:07:48] total cost is that that
[04:07:51 - 04:07:51] i don't have the breakdown
[04:07:51 - 04:07:52] on the bid in front
[04:07:52 - 04:07:52] of me front of me
[04:07:52 - 04:07:55] um um that's okay the
[04:07:55 - 04:07:55] the site prep i i
[04:07:57 - 04:07:57] would take an educated guess
[04:07:57 - 04:07:59] i i believe it's it's
[04:07:59 - 04:08:00] at least 50 of the
[04:08:00 - 04:08:00] believe it's it's at least
[04:08:00 - 04:08:00] 50 of the cost cost
[04:08:00 - 04:08:04] cost okay okay for site
[04:08:04 - 04:08:06] prep so can you describe
[04:08:06 - 04:08:09] it bp dominguez do you
[04:08:09 - 04:08:12] have the the cost in
[04:08:12 - 04:08:12] by any chance in your
[04:08:12 - 04:08:14] email yes so we have
[04:08:14 - 04:08:14] the the total bid at
[04:08:19 - 04:08:19] 1 38 million um but
[04:08:19 - 04:08:21] as stated um and then
[04:08:21 - 04:08:21] i was going to ask
[04:08:21 - 04:08:23] john uh if we table
[04:08:23 - 04:08:23] this to the next board
[04:08:24 - 04:08:26] meeting will that impact our
[04:08:26 - 04:08:28] project or i would not
[04:08:28 - 04:08:28] suggest that i would not
[04:08:28 - 04:08:30] suggest that okay okay i
[04:08:30 - 04:08:30] would not i think we
[04:08:30 - 04:08:35] need to provide responses to
[04:08:35 - 04:08:35] the board if pull up
[04:08:35 - 04:08:37] i we could take a
[04:08:37 - 04:08:37] minute or two to pull
[04:08:37 - 04:08:39] up the details i'm sure
[04:08:39 - 04:08:44] you have it an email
[04:08:44 - 04:08:44] so that you explain the
[04:08:44 - 04:08:47] the cost can you do
[04:08:47 - 04:08:49] that john yes yes we
[04:08:49 - 04:08:52] could do that okay um
[04:08:52 - 04:08:52] we we could send the
[04:08:52 - 04:08:54] rendering to the board of
[04:08:54 - 04:08:54] trustees but i want to
[04:08:57 - 04:08:57] make sure they respond to
[04:08:57 - 04:09:01] the cost which is the
[04:09:01 - 04:09:03] major concern what is generating
[04:09:03 - 04:09:03] the greatest cost in this
[04:09:04 - 04:09:06] project so i want to
[04:09:06 - 04:09:06] say there's probably a lot
[04:09:06 - 04:09:06] of i want to say
[04:09:06 - 04:09:07] there's probably a lot of
[04:09:07 - 04:09:09] concrete concrete can you pull
[04:09:09 - 04:09:09] it up can you pull
[04:09:09 - 04:09:11] up right now right now
[04:09:11 - 04:09:13] um um i would have
[04:09:13 - 04:09:17] to grab my computer yes
[04:09:17 - 04:09:17] we could that's fine yes
[04:09:18 - 04:09:19] we could that's fine dr
[04:09:19 - 04:09:22] dr is it possible to
[04:09:22 - 04:09:24] get um renderings included with
[04:09:24 - 04:09:26] these board documents in the
[04:09:26 - 04:09:26] future anytime we're talking about
[04:09:28 - 04:09:28] you know when a design
[04:09:28 - 04:09:31] is ready or it's in
[04:09:31 - 04:09:31] process just so we know
[04:09:31 - 04:09:32] you know what it looks
[04:09:32 - 04:09:34] like definitely we will do
[04:09:34 - 04:09:34] that moving definitely we will
[04:09:34 - 04:09:34] do that moving forward forward

[04:11:26 - 04:11:32] to be closed what's the
[04:11:32 - 04:11:34] plan i've never heard of
[04:11:34 - 04:11:37] uh it's the site where
[04:11:37 - 04:11:37] 9 f and g were
[04:11:37 - 04:11:37] it's the site where 9
[04:11:37 - 04:11:38] f and g were located
[04:11:38 - 04:11:42] located well this says that
[04:11:42 - 04:11:45] uh the student center replaces
[04:11:45 - 04:11:46] 9c student services that's what
[04:11:46 - 04:11:46] it says right services that's
[04:11:47 - 04:11:48] what it says right here
[04:11:48 - 04:11:51] here i believe that's a
[04:11:51 - 04:11:58] typo yeah that's what i'm
[04:11:58 - 04:11:59] leaving i'm trying to pull
[04:11:59 - 04:12:02] up the tabulations for you
[04:12:02 - 04:12:02] but i don't have there's
[04:12:02 - 04:12:07] no detail on open gov
[04:12:07 - 04:12:07] for me to pull up
[04:12:07 - 04:12:09] um angelique do you have
[04:12:09 - 04:12:10] them angelique do you have
[04:12:10 - 04:12:13] them detail detail yeah well
[04:12:13 - 04:12:13] i i would so what
[04:12:13 - 04:12:16] we're trying to determine is
[04:12:16 - 04:12:18] a breakdown of the cost
[04:12:18 - 04:12:18] so that we identify what
[04:12:18 - 04:12:21] is generating the greatest cost
[04:12:21 - 04:12:24] in this project do you
[04:12:24 - 04:12:24] have that yeah it's an
[04:12:24 - 04:12:25] project do you have that
[04:12:25 - 04:12:25] yeah it's an open open
[04:12:39 - 04:12:39] what does that mean open
[04:12:39 - 04:12:41] gov that's our bidding system
[04:12:41 - 04:12:44] so we have the um
[04:12:44 - 04:12:48] proposals the detailed proposals that
[04:12:48 - 04:12:48] we go over those costs
[04:12:48 - 04:12:50] with you so i have
[04:12:50 - 04:12:50] it here in front of
[04:12:50 - 04:12:52] me so the prime contractor
[04:12:52 - 04:13:00] who is study solutions uh
[04:13:00 - 04:13:00] they have multiple sub subcontractors
[04:13:02 - 04:13:02] that will be doing the
[04:13:02 - 04:13:05] concrete grading electrical demo and
[04:13:05 - 04:13:10] landscaping of that area uh
[04:13:10 - 04:13:10] so uh first um subcontractor
[04:13:12 - 04:13:12] who's doing the concrete and
[04:13:12 - 04:13:13] grading is who's doing the
[04:13:13 - 04:13:14] concrete and grading is 453
[04:13:15 - 04:13:16] 387 453 387 which is
[04:13:16 - 04:13:16] our biggest cost along with
[04:13:16 - 04:13:19] the general contractor as i
[04:13:19 - 04:13:20] stated before uh we have
[04:13:20 - 04:13:22] electrical that's going in me
[04:13:22 - 04:13:22] me me me me me
[04:13:22 - 04:13:22] me me me me me
[04:13:22 - 04:13:23] me me me me me
[04:13:23 - 04:13:23] me me me me me
[04:13:23 - 04:13:23] mentioned uh for me me
[04:13:23 - 04:13:24] me me me me me
[04:13:24 - 04:13:25] me mentioned uh for 41
[04:13:25 - 04:13:27] 76 41 76 um and
[04:13:27 - 04:13:27] then we have the demo
[04:13:27 - 04:13:28] of the area right so
[04:13:28 - 04:13:28] we have to break down
[04:13:31 - 04:13:31] the asphalt and remove all
[04:13:31 - 04:13:34] that um so that's another
[04:13:34 - 04:13:36] 84 916 the marina landscape
[04:13:36 - 04:13:38] who will be doing is
[04:13:38 - 04:13:38] another subcontractor who will be
[04:13:40 - 04:13:40] doing all of the landscape
[04:13:40 - 04:13:42] in that area is 139
[04:13:42 - 04:13:46] 250 and that equals our
[04:13:46 - 04:13:48] million58486 in addition to that
[04:13:48 - 04:13:51] there is an alternate uh
[04:13:51 - 04:13:54] to add in telecom infrastructure
[04:13:54 - 04:13:57] for security cameras low voltage
[04:13:57 - 04:13:57] for uh waps um which
[04:13:57 - 04:14:01] is the internet um for
[04:14:01 - 04:14:03] an additional 73 288 and
[04:14:03 - 04:14:03] i believe we built in
[04:14:03 - 04:14:05] a contingency in there as
[04:14:05 - 04:14:08] well for any unforeseen conditions
[04:14:08 - 04:14:08] so i do apologize for
[04:14:08 - 04:14:09] not having this information we're
[04:14:09 - 04:14:10] going to having this information
[04:14:11 - 04:14:15] we're going to have um
[04:14:15 - 04:14:15] it's possible uh that we
[04:14:15 - 04:14:17] can put the cameras there
[04:14:17 - 04:14:17] it does not mean that
[04:14:19 - 04:14:19] we're going to have cameras
[04:14:19 - 04:14:22] there so the cameras aren't
[04:14:22 - 04:14:24] included in this uh no
[04:14:24 - 04:14:26] the infrastructure for having security
[04:14:26 - 04:14:26] cameras is going to be
[04:14:26 - 04:14:29] built in but we haven't
[04:14:29 - 04:14:30] approved the actual cameras to
[04:14:30 - 04:14:32] be installed that would be
[04:14:32 - 04:14:35] another added cost so it's
[04:14:35 - 04:14:35] going to be concrete furniture
[04:14:35 - 04:14:35] so it's going to be
[04:14:35 - 04:14:37] concrete furniture yes yes and
[04:14:37 - 04:14:37] then some green some landscape
[04:14:40 - 04:14:40] mhm that's correct and we
[04:14:40 - 04:14:43] require irrigation to keep the
[04:14:43 - 04:14:46] grass green so that's part
[04:14:46 - 04:14:48] of it as well and
[04:14:48 - 04:14:48] this represents the lowest bid
[04:14:48 - 04:14:49] that was provided that is
[04:14:49 - 04:14:53] correct where bids went up
[04:14:53 - 04:14:54] beyond 2 2 million that
[04:14:54 - 04:14:56] is correct and then you'll

[04:14:58 - 04:14:58] will send you the renderings
[04:14:58 - 04:14:59] later this evening unfortunately i
[04:14:59 - 04:15:01] don't have those i apologize
[04:15:01 - 04:15:01] in advance for have those
[04:15:01 - 04:15:02] i apologize in advance for
[04:15:02 - 04:15:06] that that to follow up
[04:15:06 - 04:15:09] a little bit i know
[04:15:09 - 04:15:09] that some of the offices
[04:15:09 - 04:15:12] were 9c were moved to
[04:15:12 - 04:15:12] the student center what what
[04:15:12 - 04:15:16] is happening with that that
[04:15:16 - 04:15:21] uh that 9c i believe
[04:15:21 - 04:15:21] we don't have that correct
[04:15:23 - 04:15:23] we had 9f and 9g
[04:15:23 - 04:15:26] modular but the 9c what's
[04:15:26 - 04:15:28] happening with that they pick
[04:15:28 - 04:15:28] us up so currently that
[04:15:28 - 04:15:31] is the uh site for
[04:15:31 - 04:15:34] our basic needs um programming
[04:15:34 - 04:15:34] and also staff offices and
[04:15:36 - 04:15:36] so forth in addition to
[04:15:36 - 04:15:41] our international student programs okay
[04:15:41 - 04:15:41] so we're keeping it for
[04:15:41 - 04:15:44] a while um it is
[04:15:44 - 04:15:44] the the location for now
[04:15:44 - 04:15:49] until uh um any any
[04:15:49 - 04:15:49] potential uh changes into the
[04:15:49 - 04:15:51] future yeah 9c is a
[04:15:51 - 04:15:53] permanent building right yeah that's
[04:15:53 - 04:15:54] a permanent building there's no
[04:16:01 - 04:16:01] unless there's plans approved to
[04:16:01 - 04:16:02] move forward with another student
[04:16:02 - 04:16:04] services building but at the
[04:16:04 - 04:16:06] moment there's not so there's
[04:16:06 - 04:16:06] just a couple of programs
[04:16:06 - 04:16:12] in there and it's it's
[04:16:12 - 04:16:12] kind of not as busy
[04:16:12 - 04:16:14] as it was used to
[04:16:14 - 04:16:17] be and correct so uh
[04:16:17 - 04:16:17] there is uh again basic
[04:16:20 - 04:16:20] needs international student programs 9c
[04:16:23 - 04:16:23] stage is still used at
[04:16:23 - 04:16:30] times uh for additional discussion
[04:16:30 - 04:16:32] oh yeah i had a
[04:16:32 - 04:16:33] question about the concrete furniture
[04:16:35 - 04:16:35] is it is it going
[04:16:35 - 04:16:35] to be similar to what
[04:16:37 - 04:16:37] we have outside of the
[04:16:37 - 04:16:41] uh business technology center i
[04:16:41 - 04:16:41] think it's going to be
[04:16:41 - 04:16:43] uh more similar to what's
[04:16:43 - 04:16:43] outside of building 414 if
[04:16:43 - 04:16:44] i'm not mistaken is that
[04:16:46 - 04:16:46] yeah that and student center
[04:16:48 - 04:16:50] okay the shared quad i
[04:16:50 - 04:16:50] just remember the the concrete
[04:16:51 - 04:16:51] furniture there you have some
[04:16:51 - 04:16:57] really tall like chair concrete
[04:16:57 - 04:16:57] chairs and i'm not sure
[04:16:57 - 04:16:58] how usable they are maybe
[04:16:58 - 04:17:00] people love them but just
[04:17:00 - 04:17:00] want to make sure that
[04:17:00 - 04:17:02] whatever we're doing is actually
[04:17:02 - 04:17:04] usable and not just aesthetically
[04:17:04 - 04:17:07] interesting yeah i concur yeah
[04:17:07 - 04:17:08] we we will look into
[04:17:08 - 04:17:08] that but most definitely it's
[04:17:09 - 04:17:09] going to be closer to
[04:17:09 - 04:17:11] what's currently in front of
[04:17:11 - 04:17:11] student center and in front
[04:17:14 - 04:17:14] of building 414 to make
[04:17:14 - 04:17:14] that cohesive of building 414
[04:17:15 - 04:17:15] to make that cohesive look
[04:17:15 - 04:17:19] look what about charging stations
[04:17:19 - 04:17:21] or plugs um i want
[04:17:21 - 04:17:21] to say that there's probably
[04:17:22 - 04:17:22] going to be some there
[04:17:22 - 04:17:25] because we are adding electrical
[04:17:25 - 04:17:32] in that area any additional
[04:17:32 - 04:17:35] questions appreciate you uh being

[04:21:03 - 04:21:05] uh vice president joe dominguez
[04:21:05 - 04:21:10] of administrative services good good
[04:21:10 - 04:21:11] evening rosa royce um intering
[04:21:11 - 04:21:14] vice president of administrative services
[04:21:16 - 04:21:16] and just wanted to start
[04:21:16 - 04:21:18] off that uh the fiscal
[04:21:18 - 04:21:18] and budget team are committed
[04:21:21 - 04:21:21] to maximize our financial resources
[04:21:22 - 04:21:25] and support student success as
[04:21:25 - 04:21:29] we navigate um uh fiscal
[04:21:29 - 04:21:32] guidance and our state economy
[04:21:32 - 04:21:32] and here at mount sack
[04:21:32 - 04:21:34] and how to support the
[04:21:34 - 04:21:34] great work uh being done
[04:21:43 - 04:21:43] uh to give a context
[04:21:43 - 04:21:46] of the 2526 uh state
[04:21:46 - 04:21:46] budget so definitely uh testing
[04:21:49 - 04:21:49] times with the stock market
[04:21:49 - 04:21:51] uh challenging with the the
[04:21:51 - 04:21:55] impact of federal tariffs um
[04:21:55 - 04:21:58] and then uh federal cuts
[04:21:58 - 04:21:58] and then just general increases
[04:21:58 - 04:22:01] of state costs and inflation
[04:22:01 - 04:22:04] uh cost of goods and
[04:22:04 - 04:22:04] so we see that as
[04:22:04 - 04:22:08] well and with that um
[04:22:08 - 04:22:08] the state is facing a
[04:22:08 - 04:22:12] 12 billion deficit for 2526
[04:22:16 - 04:22:16] um however that does not
[04:22:16 - 04:22:18] include no major core reductions
[04:22:18 - 04:22:20] to community college programs in
[04:22:20 - 04:22:24] the state of california so
[04:22:24 - 04:22:24] um we do feel though
[04:22:24 - 04:22:27] the the fiscal impact of
[04:22:27 - 04:22:29] lack of deferred maintenance funding
[04:22:29 - 04:22:32] uh instruction equipment it and
[04:22:32 - 04:22:34] there's other items that we'll
[04:22:34 - 04:22:34] uh discuss in the that
[04:22:34 - 04:22:35] we'll uh discuss in the
[04:22:35 - 04:22:38] presentation presentation um the governor
[04:22:38 - 04:22:42] and the state legislature supported
[04:22:42 - 04:22:42] uh a cola a 2
[04:22:42 - 04:22:47] 3 which equates to 24
[04:22:47 - 04:22:51] uh4 2 million and provided
[04:22:51 - 04:22:51] 140 million across the 2425
[04:22:53 - 04:22:55] and 2526 budget years to
[04:22:55 - 04:22:57] support a combined enrollment growth
[04:22:57 - 04:23:00] of 2 35 um this
[04:23:00 - 04:23:00] was interesting and we reached
[04:23:02 - 04:23:02] out to the state and
[04:23:02 - 04:23:04] the chancellor's office and our
[04:23:04 - 04:23:06] district auditing firm and confirmed
[04:23:06 - 04:23:06] that uh when the governor
[04:23:10 - 04:23:10] did that we recognize it
[04:23:10 - 04:23:13] in 2425 and another portion
[04:23:13 - 04:23:13] in 2526 and we have
[04:23:16 - 04:23:16] slides later to break that
[04:23:16 - 04:23:18] down um in addition to
[04:23:18 - 04:23:18] uh the the context and
[04:23:18 - 04:23:20] the environment here in california
[04:23:20 - 04:23:23] with the wildfires uh the
[04:23:23 - 04:23:26] governor legislature also have a
[04:23:26 - 04:23:26] fire related tax backfill of
[04:23:30 - 04:23:30] 3 8 8 million for
[04:23:30 - 04:23:30] 2425 and 8 million and
[04:23:30 - 04:23:30] 3 8 8 million for
[04:23:30 - 04:23:31] 2425 and 8 million and
[04:23:31 - 04:23:34] 2526 2526 uh cash flow
[04:23:34 - 04:23:34] reserves and the prop 98
[04:23:37 - 04:23:37] split uh specific to the
[04:23:37 - 04:23:39] proposition 98 split that's in
[04:23:39 - 04:23:43] reference to transitional kinder um
[04:23:43 - 04:23:47] portion of that is k12
[04:23:47 - 04:23:47] and then the other portion
[04:23:47 - 04:23:49] is community college so there
[04:23:49 - 04:23:52] was a portion or a
[04:23:52 - 04:23:52] proposal um that was going
[04:23:54 - 04:23:54] to shift those funds from
[04:23:54 - 04:23:58] the community college system to
[04:23:58 - 04:24:01] the k12 system and through
[04:24:01 - 04:24:01] uh back and forth and
[04:24:01 - 04:24:04] through negotiations at the state
[04:24:04 - 04:24:06] level uh at the recent
[04:24:06 - 04:24:09] announcement they're returning the 260
[04:24:09 - 04:24:11] million as ongoing funding to
[04:24:11 - 04:24:14] the community college system so
[04:24:14 - 04:24:14] it's not going to k12
[04:24:14 - 04:24:16] uh as of what we
[04:24:16 - 04:24:16] have right now uh we
[04:24:16 - 04:24:17] don't know down the road
[04:24:17 - 04:24:17] but as of right now
[04:24:17 - 04:24:21] that's what it is um
[04:24:21 - 04:24:21] one of the other challenges
[04:24:21 - 04:24:25] as i mentioned is the
[04:24:25 - 04:24:27] um deferrals uh so even
[04:24:27 - 04:24:27] though uh in general funding
[04:24:27 - 04:24:31] was not reduced uh they
[04:24:31 - 04:24:33] submitted some ius uh to
[04:24:33 - 04:24:37] community college systems in california
[04:24:37 - 04:24:37] at the tune of 48
[04:24:37 - 04:24:41] 4 million for 2526 to
[04:24:41 - 04:24:44] go to 2627 so that's
[04:24:44 - 04:24:44] a delay of our skiff
[04:24:44 - 04:24:47] payment uh to our district
[04:24:47 - 04:24:50] uh that delay equates to
[04:24:50 - 04:24:50] 11 8 million for mount
[04:24:50 - 04:24:53] sack um the good news
[04:24:53 - 04:24:53] is we have um reserves
[04:24:56 - 04:24:56] and cash flow and we're
[04:24:56 - 04:24:58] healthy so we have full
[04:24:58 - 04:24:58] confidence that we can take
[04:25:01 - 04:25:01] that on uh that deferral
[04:25:01 - 04:25:04] and so we don't see
[04:25:04 - 04:25:04] a need that we need
[04:25:04 - 04:25:08] to borrow or do um
[04:25:08 - 04:25:08] any additional um steps to
[04:25:08 - 04:25:11] take that so we're good
[04:25:11 - 04:25:14] and then um proposition 98
[04:25:14 - 04:25:14] the governor is also authorized
[04:25:14 - 04:25:17] with the legislature uh to
[04:25:17 - 04:25:19] tip into uh tap into
[04:25:19 - 04:25:19] their reserves and the rainy
[04:25:19 - 04:25:22] day fund and so they'll
[04:25:22 - 04:25:25] continue uh to do so
[04:25:25 - 04:25:26] to address the state deficit
[04:25:28 - 04:25:28] uh in expanding access equity
[04:25:28 - 04:25:31] and workforce readiness some one-time
[04:25:31 - 04:25:34] funds i think that was
[04:25:34 - 04:25:36] also finalized uh and we'll
[04:25:36 - 04:25:36] go through briefly but uh
[04:25:36 - 04:25:37] tech and data systems at
[04:25:37 - 04:25:42] the state level 12 million
[04:25:42 - 04:25:42] 6 6 6 million for

[04:25:51 - 04:25:54] produced and participated and been
[04:25:54 - 04:25:56] successful there and then credit
[04:25:56 - 04:25:58] for prior learning and career

[04:26:18 - 04:26:20] to students uh 15 million
[04:26:20 - 04:26:23] one time to support dreamer
[04:26:23 - 04:26:23] resource leaison and kudos to
[04:26:25 - 04:26:25] our state of california because
[04:26:25 - 04:26:27] we definitely feel the um
[04:26:27 - 04:26:30] the difficulty at the federal
[04:26:30 - 04:26:30] level and then 5 1
[04:26:30 - 04:26:32] million one time for financial
[04:26:32 - 04:26:34] aid outreach through community- based
[04:26:34 - 04:26:36] organizations so a holistic approach
[04:26:36 - 04:26:39] with our community partners um
[04:26:39 - 04:26:44] in regards to our skiff
[04:26:44 - 04:26:44] um additional 100 million uh
[04:26:44 - 04:26:46] for growth bringing the total
[04:26:46 - 04:26:49] growth funding to 128 1
[04:26:49 - 04:26:49] million and repaying the skiff
[04:26:52 - 04:26:55] deferral of 243 7 uh
[04:26:55 - 04:26:55] that was impacted in that
[04:26:55 - 04:26:57] fiscal year and then reappropriates
[04:26:57 - 04:26:59] revenues to support fully funding
[04:26:59 - 04:26:59] the skiff for support fully
[04:27:00 - 04:27:01] funding the skiff for 2425
[04:27:01 - 04:27:03] 2425 and then for 2526
[04:27:03 - 04:27:06] the governor legislature have come
[04:27:06 - 04:27:09] to agreement to support skiff
[04:27:09 - 04:27:09] at 39 9 million and
[04:27:09 - 04:27:13] that is a 57 enrollment
[04:27:13 - 04:27:19] growth uh in addition 217
[04:27:19 - 04:27:19] 4 to support cola at
[04:27:19 - 04:27:21] 2 3 uh and however
[04:27:21 - 04:27:23] like i mentioned earlier uh
[04:27:23 - 04:27:23] they came to a consensus
[04:27:23 - 04:27:24] to defer uh they came
[04:27:24 - 04:27:25] to a consensus to defer
[04:27:25 - 04:27:29] 48 4 48 4 4
[04:27:29 - 04:27:29] million from 2526 to 2627
[04:27:31 - 04:27:31] but also reappropriated revenues to
[04:27:36 - 04:27:36] support fully funding the skiff
[04:27:36 - 04:27:38] and so um there is
[04:27:38 - 04:27:41] definitely need throughout the state
[04:27:41 - 04:27:41] system um but we are
[04:27:41 - 04:27:43] happy to see that those
[04:27:43 - 04:27:45] reappropriations have taken place to
[04:27:45 - 04:27:49] support our skiff funding model
[04:27:49 - 04:27:49] uh in addition the 100
[04:27:49 - 04:27:54] million for 2425 growth funding
[04:27:54 - 04:27:54] and the 39 uh 9
[04:27:58 - 04:27:58] uh and 2526 is a
[04:27:58 - 04:27:58] combined growth rate of uh
[04:27:58 - 04:27:59] and 2526 is a combined
[04:27:59 - 04:27:59] growth rate of 2 35
[04:27:59 - 04:28:02] 2 35 and we uh
[04:28:02 - 04:28:02] commend the state and it
[04:28:02 - 04:28:05] helps us reduce the amount
[04:28:05 - 04:28:08] of unfunded full-time uh equivalent
[04:28:08 - 04:28:11] students and so we are
[04:28:11 - 04:28:11] working very hard to do
[04:28:11 - 04:28:15] so and then our um
[04:28:15 - 04:28:15] in the process um the
[04:28:15 - 04:28:15] early then our um in
[04:28:15 - 04:28:16] the process um the early
[04:28:16 - 04:28:18] recalculation recalculation is usually done
[04:28:18 - 04:28:20] when the fiscal year comes
[04:28:20 - 04:28:20] to a close the legislature
[04:28:20 - 04:28:22] and the department of finance
[04:28:22 - 04:28:24] takes a look at that
[04:28:24 - 04:28:29] uh and makes adjustments themselves
[04:28:29 - 04:28:29] uh to align to uh
[04:28:29 - 04:28:32] funding based on actuals and
[04:28:32 - 04:28:34] audited data and because of
[04:28:34 - 04:28:37] that the additional 100 million
[04:28:37 - 04:28:37] in growth funding for 2425
[04:28:37 - 04:28:39] and then accounts for additional
[04:28:39 - 04:28:42] funds appropriated in the budget
[04:28:42 - 04:28:45] act and then for moving
[04:28:45 - 04:28:45] forward uh for 2425 the
[04:28:48 - 04:28:48] second principal a portionment was
[04:28:48 - 04:28:50] was used for the the
[04:28:50 - 04:28:53] calculations for that funding portion
[04:28:56 - 04:28:56] so i just wanted to
[04:28:56 - 04:28:59] remind everyone uh mount sack
[04:28:59 - 04:28:59] we are doing amazing work
[04:28:59 - 04:29:01] in supporting student success our
[04:29:01 - 04:29:05] faculty classified everyone uh from
[04:29:05 - 04:29:07] our trustees our president and
[04:29:07 - 04:29:09] all those that are supporting
[04:29:09 - 04:29:09] the cause but uh from
[04:29:09 - 04:29:13] the base in our our
[04:29:13 - 04:29:16] skiff formula is our enrollment
[04:29:16 - 04:29:16] numbers and then you add
[04:29:16 - 04:29:18] our supplemental which is the
[04:29:18 - 04:29:20] number of students receiving grants
[04:29:20 - 04:29:23] from college promise our pel
[04:29:23 - 04:29:25] and our california non-resident students
[04:29:25 - 04:29:28] that receive a grant and
[04:29:28 - 04:29:28] then you add to the
[04:29:28 - 04:29:31] success measures which is in
[04:29:31 - 04:29:34] regards to our earned degrees
[04:29:34 - 04:29:37] certificates transfers to four-year universities
[04:29:37 - 04:29:40] or completing level uh transfer
[04:29:40 - 04:29:42] level math in english and
[04:29:42 - 04:29:45] then that equals our skiff
[04:29:45 - 04:29:48] calculated revenue so i mentioned
[04:29:48 - 04:29:48] that because uh as we
[04:29:51 - 04:29:51] continue down that path to
[04:29:51 - 04:29:54] be successful um once again
[04:29:54 - 04:29:58] the one-time and then turning
[04:29:58 - 04:29:58] to ongoing funding for 2425
[04:30:02 - 04:30:02] we have funded 34 776
[04:30:05 - 04:30:05] full-time equivalent students we still
[04:30:08 - 04:30:08] have unfunded 810 uh full-time
[04:30:11 - 04:30:11] equivalent students so question mark
[04:30:13 - 04:30:13] uh with the governor the
[04:30:13 - 04:30:15] legislature the state economy and
[04:30:15 - 04:30:18] all the things that i
[04:30:18 - 04:30:18] mentioned um but let's see
[04:30:18 - 04:30:20] uh how that moves forward
[04:30:20 - 04:30:22] but of as of right
[04:30:22 - 04:30:22] now that is a commitment
[04:30:22 - 04:30:25] that we have to fund
[04:30:25 - 04:30:28] those 810 unfunded full-time equivalent
[04:30:28 - 04:30:31] students and so the funding
[04:30:31 - 04:30:33] formula and then uh lobbyists
[04:30:33 - 04:30:33] and just the community college
[04:30:38 - 04:30:38] system uh to push to
[04:30:38 - 04:30:38] get um additional system uh
[04:30:38 - 04:30:39] to push to get um
[04:30:40 - 04:30:43] additional funding funding kudos to
[04:30:43 - 04:30:46] instruction and everyone uh throughout
[04:30:46 - 04:30:46] our campus it's a team
[04:30:49 - 04:30:49] effort but we are uh
[04:30:49 - 04:30:52] credit enrollment trends overall uh
[04:30:52 - 04:30:52] we are on ticking up
[04:30:54 - 04:30:58] at 199 26 for 2425
[04:30:58 - 04:30:58] and the trend is still
[04:30:58 - 04:31:00] moving upward so uh kudos

[04:31:36 - 04:31:40] the work that we're doing
[04:31:40 - 04:31:40] and we'll continue to do
[04:31:40 - 04:31:44] so um and then regards
[04:31:44 - 04:31:47] to our actuals to our
[04:31:47 - 04:31:47] uh variance uh per se
[04:31:47 - 04:31:49] so i wanted to point
[04:31:49 - 04:31:51] out um the the highlight
[04:31:51 - 04:31:51] here so 2425 the skiff
[04:31:54 - 04:31:54] adjustments including growth approved by
[04:31:57 - 04:31:57] the governor on june 27th
[04:31:57 - 04:32:00] that was after our last
[04:32:00 - 04:32:04] uh budget presentation that 13
[04:32:04 - 04:32:04] 2 2 million 10 million
[04:32:04 - 04:32:07] is uh that funding that
[04:32:07 - 04:32:07] they announced on the 27th
[04:32:11 - 04:32:11] and then that supports the
[04:32:11 - 04:32:13] 1 351 uh full-time equivalent
[04:32:13 - 04:32:16] students and then the remaining
[04:32:16 - 04:32:16] is our p2 growth so
[04:32:16 - 04:32:19] that as we grow as
[04:32:19 - 04:32:19] a district so our 2425
[04:32:23 - 04:32:23] estimated revenues at 16 4
[04:32:25 - 04:32:25] uh million and then if
[04:32:25 - 04:32:31] you look at our 2425
[04:32:31 - 04:32:31] unexpended line items um the
[04:32:31 - 04:32:34] 8 3 are are our
[04:32:34 - 04:32:34] va our vacancies uh and
[04:32:36 - 04:32:36] benefits so salaries and benefits
[04:32:40 - 04:32:40] vacancies and then uh the
[04:32:40 - 04:32:43] 3 1 negative is the
[04:32:43 - 04:32:44] impact of hourly faculty hours
[04:32:45 - 04:32:45] and we're partnering up with
[04:32:45 - 04:32:47] instruction as we move forward
[04:32:47 - 04:32:49] and then we also have
[04:32:49 - 04:32:49] some good news that we
[04:32:49 - 04:32:53] are uh budgeting uh to
[04:32:53 - 04:32:55] hire additional faculty uh but
[04:32:55 - 04:32:55] we need to work on
[04:32:55 - 04:32:57] a balance between our hourly
[04:32:57 - 04:32:59] and our full-time faculty and
[04:32:59 - 04:32:59] so that's where you see
[04:32:59 - 04:33:01] the 3 1 so that's
[04:33:01 - 04:33:01] an area that we'll work
[04:33:04 - 04:33:04] in partnership uh as we
[04:33:04 - 04:33:07] move forward and then the
[04:33:07 - 04:33:07] parking uh support due to
[04:33:12 - 04:33:12] decrease in students um this
[04:33:12 - 04:33:14] is postco and so uh
[04:33:14 - 04:33:14] i just want to commend
[04:33:14 - 04:33:16] our instruction team though we
[04:33:16 - 04:33:20] have online instruction different modalities
[04:33:20 - 04:33:22] but now uh the ripple
[04:33:22 - 04:33:22] effect of that is the
[04:33:25 - 04:33:25] reduced parking permits and that
[04:33:25 - 04:33:26] is the amount that we're
[04:33:26 - 04:33:29] committing from the general fund
[04:33:29 - 04:33:29] to offset the reduction of
[04:33:32 - 04:33:36] our parking permits so we
[04:33:36 - 04:33:36] have approximately 1 9 uh
[04:33:36 - 04:33:38] million from the general fund
[04:33:38 - 04:33:40] to help support that so
[04:33:40 - 04:33:40] we are going to work
[04:33:40 - 04:33:43] together to to see what
[04:33:43 - 04:33:43] we can do um and
[04:33:43 - 04:33:45] then also as we mentioned
[04:33:45 - 04:33:45] if that is a trend
[04:33:47 - 04:33:47] then we need to have
[04:33:47 - 04:33:49] that budgeted um so we
[04:33:49 - 04:33:49] are are working with the
[04:33:49 - 04:33:52] team on that and then
[04:33:52 - 04:33:52] the other piece uh right
[04:33:57 - 04:33:57] below that at 7 1
[04:33:57 - 04:33:59] million um one thing that
[04:33:59 - 04:33:59] uh that is a challenge
[04:33:59 - 04:34:02] and it hasn't been mentioned
[04:34:02 - 04:34:02] on on any state um
[04:34:04 - 04:34:04] update but we know we
[04:34:04 - 04:34:06] have not been funded for
[04:34:06 - 04:34:09] 2 years in deferred maintenance
[04:34:09 - 04:34:11] and instruction technology and that's
[04:34:11 - 04:34:11] a challenge for us and
[04:34:12 - 04:34:14] so when that has taken
[04:34:14 - 04:34:16] place we have to from
[04:34:16 - 04:34:16] our general fund commit uh
[04:34:16 - 04:34:19] so we have to fix
[04:34:19 - 04:34:22] the broken things and systems
[04:34:22 - 04:34:24] and infrastructure and provide uh
[04:34:24 - 04:34:24] as much as we can
[04:34:24 - 04:34:26] the latest technology uh for
[04:34:26 - 04:34:29] our students and our faculty
[04:34:29 - 04:34:29] and our staff and so
[04:34:29 - 04:34:32] that is our commitment and
[04:34:32 - 04:34:34] um so we'll continue to
[04:34:34 - 04:34:34] do so um but that's
[04:34:34 - 04:34:37] a challenge that we're faced
[04:34:37 - 04:34:37] with um and then in
[04:34:40 - 04:34:40] addition uh utilities and so
[04:34:40 - 04:34:42] um the ongoing cost of
[04:34:42 - 04:34:44] utilities and we're working with
[04:34:44 - 04:34:47] our facilities team and maintenance
[04:34:47 - 04:34:47] and operations and how we
[04:34:49 - 04:34:49] could reduce our utility usage
[04:34:49 - 04:34:52] and i know um our
[04:34:52 - 04:34:54] facilities team is also working
[04:34:54 - 04:34:54] on a solar project we
[04:34:54 - 04:34:57] have more information coming at
[04:34:57 - 04:34:58] another board meeting but that's
[04:34:58 - 04:35:01] also an opportunity how do
[04:35:01 - 04:35:01] we reduce our utility costs
[04:35:01 - 04:35:02] and so that's an opportunity
[04:35:02 - 04:35:07] that we're looking at so
[04:35:07 - 04:35:10] in in total the positive
[04:35:10 - 04:35:10] variance of 6 4 4
[04:35:10 - 04:35:13] which gives us an ending
[04:35:13 - 04:35:13] fund balance uh before gsp
[04:35:18 - 04:35:18] b 101 at um 65
[04:35:18 - 04:35:21] 9 and gasp 101 is
[04:35:21 - 04:35:23] a new government accounting standard
[04:35:23 - 04:35:26] that establishes a single model
[04:35:26 - 04:35:28] uh for districts and government
[04:35:28 - 04:35:28] entities to follow and it
[04:35:31 - 04:35:31] recognizes and um measuring liabilities
[04:35:34 - 04:35:34] uh for compensated absences and
[04:35:34 - 04:35:36] we have our auditors uh
[04:35:36 - 04:35:40] here this evening with us
[04:35:40 - 04:35:40] to explain more but i
[04:35:40 - 04:35:42] just want you to know
[04:35:42 - 04:35:42] that we have implemented gazsby
[04:35:46 - 04:35:46] 101 as required and um
[04:35:46 - 04:35:48] in also in guidance with
[04:35:48 - 04:35:50] our district auditor we're navigating
[04:35:50 - 04:35:53] that and making sure that
[04:35:53 - 04:35:53] we do it correctly but
[04:35:53 - 04:35:58] you'll see that uh line
[04:35:58 - 04:35:58] item um of 12 3
[04:35:58 - 04:36:01] and so the ending fund
[04:36:01 - 04:36:01] balance with the gazsby 101
[04:36:04 - 04:36:04] adjustment brings us to 78
[04:36:04 - 04:36:06] 2 too um but we'll
[04:36:06 - 04:36:06] go ahead with that i'd
[04:36:06 - 04:36:08] like to bring up um
[04:36:08 - 04:36:13] introduce our district auditor alicia
[04:36:13 - 04:36:17] herrera from id bailey and
[04:36:17 - 04:36:17] we will do a brief
[04:36:17 - 04:36:18] uh gatsby 101 and we
[04:36:18 - 04:36:19] will do a brief uh
[04:36:19 - 04:36:21] gatsby 101 overview overview thank
[04:36:21 - 04:36:23] you you're welcome well good
[04:36:23 - 04:36:23] evening everyone um joe and
[04:36:25 - 04:36:25] rosa asked me to come
[04:36:25 - 04:36:28] here today to give you
[04:36:28 - 04:36:28] a brief summary of the
[04:36:28 - 04:36:30] gazsby 101 new accounting standard
[04:36:30 - 04:36:33] um as joe mentioned it
[04:36:33 - 04:36:33] is um a long time
[04:36:33 - 04:36:35] coming there it's been over
[04:36:35 - 04:36:38] 30 years since gazby has
[04:36:38 - 04:36:38] made any updates to accounting
[04:36:40 - 04:36:40] for compensated absences which is
[04:36:40 - 04:36:42] any type of um employee
[04:36:42 - 04:36:44] leave so for mount sack
[04:36:44 - 04:36:46] that's primarily vacation leave sick
[04:36:46 - 04:36:46] leave and faculty load banking
[04:36:49 - 04:36:49] leave this standard was put
[04:36:49 - 04:36:51] into place to modernize and
[04:36:51 - 04:36:53] standardize what governments are doing
[04:36:53 - 04:36:55] in practice because we saw
[04:36:55 - 04:36:55] that it was kind of
[04:36:55 - 04:36:56] a patchwork of old standards
[04:36:56 - 04:36:58] and people were accounting for
[04:36:58 - 04:37:00] things differently so every governmental
[04:37:00 - 04:37:02] entity in the nation will
[04:37:02 - 04:37:04] adopt this standard this year
[04:37:04 - 04:37:04] uh and i'm going to
[04:37:04 - 04:37:05] go over some of the
[04:37:05 - 04:37:05] key changes and how it's
[04:37:05 - 04:37:08] going to affect mount sack
[04:37:08 - 04:37:11] so the two major changes
[04:37:11 - 04:37:11] are uh a liability for
[04:37:11 - 04:37:12] sick leave will now be
[04:37:12 - 04:37:14] recognized by the district um
[04:37:14 - 04:37:16] historically the county standards have
[04:37:16 - 04:37:18] not provided for that so
[04:37:18 - 04:37:18] now mount sack will recognize
[04:37:18 - 04:37:20] a liability for its sick
[04:37:20 - 04:37:22] leave balances to its employees
[04:37:25 - 04:37:25] additionally gazsby uh clarified that
[04:37:27 - 04:37:30] liabilities for compensated absences will
[04:37:30 - 04:37:30] only be recorded in the
[04:37:30 - 04:37:32] full acral financial statements so
[04:37:32 - 04:37:34] those are the financial statements
[04:37:34 - 04:37:34] um that we bring to
[04:37:35 - 04:37:35] you in december when i
[04:37:35 - 04:37:38] go over the audited financial
[04:37:38 - 04:37:39] statements and they should not
[04:37:39 - 04:37:40] be recorded in the fund
[04:37:41 - 04:37:41] financial statements what are which
[04:37:41 - 04:37:42] is what you guys will
[04:37:42 - 04:37:44] look at when you're looking
[04:37:44 - 04:37:44] at the budget primarily the
[04:37:47 - 04:37:47] general fund this is consistent
[04:37:47 - 04:37:49] with other liabilities that the
[04:37:49 - 04:37:51] district has for example for
[04:37:51 - 04:37:51] its oped and pension so
[04:37:53 - 04:37:53] it makes it more consistent
[04:37:53 - 04:37:57] across the board where things
[04:37:57 - 04:38:00] are getting recorded oh sorry
[04:38:00 - 04:38:02] about that thanks um we
[04:38:02 - 04:38:02] are in the preliminary stages
[04:38:02 - 04:38:04] of the audit actually our
[04:38:04 - 04:38:06] official start is next week
[04:38:06 - 04:38:06] um but in working with
[04:38:08 - 04:38:08] the district in planning for
[04:38:08 - 04:38:11] this um we are estimating
[04:38:11 - 04:38:12] that the liability for all
[04:38:12 - 04:38:15] of your compensated absences vacation
[04:38:15 - 04:38:15] sick leave and load banking
[04:38:17 - 04:38:17] is going to be 67
[04:38:17 - 04:38:19] million it's very very large
[04:38:19 - 04:38:19] but you guys are a
[04:38:19 - 04:38:21] large district and from what
[04:38:21 - 04:38:22] i've seen from some of
[04:38:22 - 04:38:24] my other community college districts
[04:38:24 - 04:38:24] that are similar in size
[04:38:24 - 04:38:27] it's it's pretty comparable the
[04:38:27 - 04:38:30] impact on the general fund
[04:38:30 - 04:38:32] as i mentioned um there's
[04:38:32 - 04:38:32] no longer going to be
[04:38:32 - 04:38:34] a liability recorded in the
[04:38:34 - 04:38:36] funds to be in accordance
[04:38:36 - 04:38:36] with this new standard mount
[04:38:38 - 04:38:38] sac has historically recorded a
[04:38:38 - 04:38:40] portion of the liability for
[04:38:40 - 04:38:44] vacation and load banking uh
[04:38:44 - 04:38:44] so that will be reversed
[04:38:44 - 04:38:46] in accordance with um when
[04:38:46 - 04:38:48] we do changes in accounting
[04:38:48 - 04:38:48] standards we um do a
[04:38:48 - 04:38:50] prior period adjustment so it
[04:38:50 - 04:38:53] doesn't hit your income statement
[04:38:53 - 04:38:55] um but important to note
[04:38:55 - 04:38:55] that just because it's not
[04:38:55 - 04:38:57] recorded in the general fund
[04:38:57 - 04:38:59] any longer doesn't mean that
[04:38:59 - 04:38:59] mount sack is um alleviated
[04:38:59 - 04:39:02] of these liabilities to their
[04:39:02 - 04:39:04] employees for leave balances uh
[04:39:04 - 04:39:07] mount stack is still liable
[04:39:07 - 04:39:07] for um amounts for vacation
[04:39:07 - 04:39:10] load banking once employees uh
[04:39:10 - 04:39:11] take those leaves or they
[04:39:11 - 04:39:13] terminate from the district those
[04:39:13 - 04:39:14] payments still need to go
[04:39:14 - 04:39:14] out so just because it's
[04:39:14 - 04:39:16] not going to be recorded
[04:39:16 - 04:39:17] in the general fund anymore
[04:39:17 - 04:39:17] it's still a very real
[04:39:20 - 04:39:21] liability for the district uh
[04:39:21 - 04:39:21] i know you guys will
[04:39:21 - 04:39:23] have lots and lots of
[04:39:23 - 04:39:23] questions for rosa and joe
[04:39:23 - 04:39:25] on the budget but i'm
[04:39:25 - 04:39:27] happy to take questions specifically
[04:39:27 - 04:39:28] related to the new accounting
[04:39:28 - 04:39:32] standard should anybody it doesn't
[04:39:35 - 04:39:35] give us more money but
[04:39:35 - 04:39:37] it lets us do our
[04:39:37 - 04:39:37] accounting so that it looks
[04:39:37 - 04:39:39] like we have more money
[04:39:39 - 04:39:39] is that what it is
[04:39:42 - 04:39:42] yeah i i um actually
[04:39:42 - 04:39:44] joe put it better than
[04:39:44 - 04:39:44] i did as a um
[04:39:44 - 04:39:46] a really detailed accountant he
[04:39:46 - 04:39:48] said they're telling you where
[04:39:48 - 04:39:48] and when to record it
[04:39:48 - 04:39:50] not when to pay it
[04:39:50 - 04:39:50] out so um yes it's
[04:39:50 - 04:39:54] going to look like you
[04:39:54 - 04:39:54] do have um a higher
[04:39:54 - 04:39:56] fund balance but you still
[04:39:56 - 04:39:57] like i mentioned it's still
[04:39:57 - 04:39:59] liability of the district gatsby
[04:39:59 - 04:39:59] is something we got to
[04:39:59 - 04:40:00] district gatsby is something we
[04:40:00 - 04:40:02] got to pay pay no
[04:40:02 - 04:40:02] no no they set the
[04:40:02 - 04:40:04] accounting rules that you have
[04:40:04 - 04:40:06] to follow so that when
[04:40:06 - 04:40:06] you go out and issue
[04:40:06 - 04:40:07] bonds and you turn in
[04:40:07 - 04:40:07] your report to the chancellor's
[04:40:09 - 04:40:09] office every year that you're
[04:40:09 - 04:40:09] in office every year that
[04:40:09 - 04:40:12] you're in compliance compliance so
[04:40:12 - 04:40:12] it's how we note it
[04:40:12 - 04:40:14] within our budget documents it's
[04:40:14 - 04:40:17] how we note it and
[04:40:17 - 04:40:17] recognize it and so it's
[04:40:17 - 04:40:21] an accounting uh procedure and
[04:40:21 - 04:40:23] a standard and the the
[04:40:23 - 04:40:25] justification the real reason why
[04:40:25 - 04:40:28] i believe the legislature implemented
[04:40:28 - 04:40:28] is every college district or
[04:40:30 - 04:40:30] city did it differently and
[04:40:30 - 04:40:35] so there wasn't a one
[04:40:35 - 04:40:35] standard process on how to
[04:40:37 - 04:40:37] report vacation sick etc and
[04:40:38 - 04:40:40] so that's why they implemented
[04:40:40 - 04:40:43] gazby 101 so so but
[04:40:43 - 04:40:43] it's something we have to
[04:40:43 - 04:40:45] pay at some point at
[04:40:45 - 04:40:48] some point yes yes when
[04:40:48 - 04:40:48] i mean who do we
[04:40:48 - 04:40:48] pay it to what is
[04:40:51 - 04:40:51] it so it's it's when
[04:40:51 - 04:40:55] the employee takes vacation sick
[04:40:55 - 04:40:59] resigns retires etc so that
[04:40:59 - 04:40:59] liability is ongoing um means
[04:41:01 - 04:41:01] it's ongoing don't we just
[04:41:01 - 04:41:05] pay this that's right as
[04:41:05 - 04:41:05] you hire new employees uh
[04:41:05 - 04:41:07] as they acrue time we
[04:41:07 - 04:41:08] need to recognize those acrue
[04:41:08 - 04:41:10] time we need to recognize
[04:41:11 - 04:41:16] those absences okay i'll talk
[04:41:16 - 04:41:16] may i ask a question
[04:41:19 - 04:41:19] trusty chiao okay i have
[04:41:19 - 04:41:23] a i'm a little confused
[04:41:23 - 04:41:23] on this one here okay
[04:41:25 - 04:41:25] let me just uh go
[04:41:25 - 04:41:27] over this one sheet just
[04:41:27 - 04:41:27] make sure i understand we
[04:41:27 - 04:41:29] are projected i'm looking at
[04:41:29 - 04:41:37] the changes in that is
[04:41:37 - 04:41:41] the projected increase in revenues
[04:41:41 - 04:41:41] for the upcoming fiscal year
[04:41:45 - 04:41:49] it's it's i'm sorry i'm
[04:41:49 - 04:41:49] on your page 13 i'm
[04:41:49 - 04:41:50] sorry i'm on your page
[04:41:50 - 04:42:02] 13 okay okay that was
[04:42:02 - 04:42:05] our adopted budget okay i
[04:42:05 - 04:42:07] understand i'm just talking about
[04:42:07 - 04:42:07] your adopted budget right now
[04:42:10 - 04:42:10] okay so our adopted budget
[04:42:10 - 04:42:13] projects that we're going to
[04:42:13 - 04:42:17] have 16 5 million more
[04:42:17 - 04:42:17] revenues in the current year
[04:42:17 - 04:42:18] okay that's that's what i
[04:42:18 - 04:42:22] see there no that's 2425
[04:42:23 - 04:42:26] not 2526 yes so that's
[04:42:26 - 04:42:27] that's our 2425 adopted budget
[04:42:27 - 04:42:32] versus the actuals may i
[04:42:32 - 04:42:32] ask okay this 12 million
[04:42:32 - 04:42:34] that we're talking about you're
[04:42:34 - 04:42:38] gas this represents vacation time
[04:42:38 - 04:42:41] earned by vacation and sick
[04:42:41 - 04:42:44] and other leave time earned
[04:42:44 - 04:42:47] by our employees that they
[04:42:47 - 04:42:47] have not taken yet is
[04:42:47 - 04:42:47] that that they have not
[04:42:47 - 04:42:47] taken yet is that correct
[04:42:47 - 04:42:51] correct correct correct correct okay
[04:42:51 - 04:42:55] that's the layman's explanation okay
[04:42:55 - 04:42:55] and this 16 million is
[04:42:55 - 04:42:59] excuse me the 12 3
[04:42:59 - 04:43:03] million represents a snapshot time
[04:43:03 - 04:43:03] point in time as of
[04:43:03 - 04:43:04] 6 3025 is that correct
[04:43:04 - 04:43:06] is that correct 6 3024
[04:43:06 - 04:43:07] 6 3024 because we would
[04:43:07 - 04:43:09] have went past prior period
[04:43:09 - 04:43:09] so 24 what was the
[04:43:13 - 04:43:13] liability as of 6 30
[04:43:13 - 04:43:15] or you haven't determined that
[04:43:15 - 04:43:17] yet right i we have
[04:43:17 - 04:43:19] an estimate we've provided preliminary
[04:43:19 - 04:43:19] or we worked with the
[04:43:21 - 04:43:21] district on preliminary estimates keep
[04:43:23 - 04:43:23] in mind we're now including
[04:43:23 - 04:43:25] sick leave it's going to
[04:43:25 - 04:43:26] be 67 million including the
[04:43:26 - 04:43:30] sick leave 67 million i
[04:43:30 - 04:43:30] believe the portion that is
[04:43:30 - 04:43:33] vacation and load banking is
[04:43:33 - 04:43:33] closer to about 15 and
[04:43:33 - 04:43:34] load banking is closer to
[04:43:34 - 04:43:37] about 15 million million 15
[04:43:37 - 04:43:40] or 50 15 okay that
[04:43:40 - 04:43:42] sounds about right okay so
[04:43:42 - 04:43:42] theoretically the change in the
[04:43:42 - 04:43:43] so theoretically the change in
[04:43:44 - 04:43:47] the liability liability is an
[04:43:47 - 04:43:47] adjustment to an income the
[04:43:50 - 04:43:52] operational income yes historically it
[04:43:52 - 04:43:55] would have been so so
[04:43:55 - 04:43:55] my question is this as
[04:43:55 - 04:43:58] we spoke on the phone
[04:43:58 - 04:43:58] previously this is to book
[04:43:58 - 04:44:02] a liability as of 63025
[04:44:02 - 04:44:03] liability as of 63025 correct
[04:44:03 - 04:44:07] correct this 12 million adjustment
[04:44:07 - 04:44:09] is to take the liability
[04:44:09 - 04:44:09] out of the general fund
[04:44:11 - 04:44:11] take it out why are
[04:44:11 - 04:44:11] we taking it out of
[04:44:13 - 04:44:13] the general fund that's that's
[04:44:13 - 04:44:15] why i i felt this
[04:44:15 - 04:44:18] was reversed okay it's the
[04:44:18 - 04:44:20] new accounting standard saying it
[04:44:20 - 04:44:20] will no longer be recorded
[04:44:20 - 04:44:22] in the general fund it
[04:44:22 - 04:44:24] will only be recorded in
[04:44:24 - 04:44:25] the full acral financial statements
[04:44:25 - 04:44:25] which the district gets in
[04:44:27 - 04:44:27] their audited financial statements once
[04:44:30 - 04:44:30] a year so very similar
[04:44:30 - 04:44:32] to oped when we talk
[04:44:32 - 04:44:32] about oped at the end
[04:44:32 - 04:44:33] of the year we know
[04:44:33 - 04:44:33] there's a liability out there
[04:44:35 - 04:44:35] for oped and unfunded liability
[04:44:35 - 04:44:37] but we don't record it
[04:44:37 - 04:44:39] in the general fund because
[04:44:39 - 04:44:39] the accounting sensors tell us
[04:44:41 - 04:44:41] not to we only show
[04:44:41 - 04:44:49] it in those full but
[04:44:49 - 04:44:49] it's a and it it
[04:44:49 - 04:44:50] doesn't impact our but it's
[04:44:50 - 04:44:51] a and it it doesn't
[04:44:51 - 04:44:55] impact our theoretically theoretically assuming
[04:44:55 - 04:44:58] our employees take regular vacation
[04:44:58 - 04:44:58] at the same rate okay
[04:44:58 - 04:45:01] this does not impact the
[04:45:01 - 04:45:01] cash flow of the does
[04:45:01 - 04:45:03] not impact the cash flow
[04:45:03 - 04:45:05] of the college if if
[04:45:06 - 04:45:06] no they would already plan
[04:45:06 - 04:45:08] for that ahead of time
[04:45:08 - 04:45:09] because they're used to making
[04:45:09 - 04:45:11] ongoing payments employee takes vacation
[04:45:11 - 04:45:13] they get their paycheck and
[04:45:13 - 04:45:13] that's it and it reduces
[04:45:15 - 04:45:15] the liability is that correct
[04:45:18 - 04:45:18] okay so explain to me
[04:45:18 - 04:45:21] the logic it's on it's
[04:45:21 - 04:45:24] a liability that's on one
[04:45:24 - 04:45:24] set of reports but not
[04:45:24 - 04:45:26] on the other i don't
[04:45:26 - 04:45:28] understand the logic on that
[04:45:30 - 04:45:30] it gets really tricky it's
[04:45:30 - 04:45:32] the basis of governmental accounting
[04:45:32 - 04:45:33] and it's one of the
[04:45:33 - 04:45:34] biggest differences between governmental accounting
[04:45:34 - 04:45:36] and your standard for-profit accounting
[04:45:36 - 04:45:40] is the concept that fund
[04:45:40 - 04:45:42] accounting is done one way
[04:45:42 - 04:45:42] and then when we consolidate
[04:45:43 - 04:45:43] everything it's done in a
[04:45:44 - 04:45:46] different way so the same
[04:45:46 - 04:45:50] reason why you don't see
[04:45:50 - 04:45:50] your bonds in in the
[04:45:50 - 04:45:52] general fund your pension liabilities
[04:45:52 - 04:45:54] in the general fund those
[04:45:54 - 04:45:54] are all on a full
[04:45:54 - 04:45:55] acral basis under the current
[04:45:55 - 04:45:58] accounting standards so therefore what
[04:45:58 - 04:46:01] you're the reason why it's
[04:46:01 - 04:46:03] reversed is because it's reflected
[04:46:03 - 04:46:03] in the opening fund balance
[04:46:04 - 04:46:04] is that correct is that
[04:46:04 - 04:46:07] correct yes yes okay and
[04:46:07 - 04:46:07] and for this report we
[04:46:08 - 04:46:10] don't need to report it
[04:46:10 - 04:46:13] because when we spoke on
[04:46:13 - 04:46:13] the phone when we spoke
[04:46:13 - 04:46:15] in our zoom meeting you
[04:46:15 - 04:46:15] know i asked you what
[04:46:15 - 04:46:17] was the entry and i
[04:46:17 - 04:46:17] said the entry was debit
[04:46:20 - 04:46:20] fund balance and credit the
[04:46:20 - 04:46:23] liability all right and and
[04:46:23 - 04:46:25] we agreed that that was
[04:46:25 - 04:46:28] the journal theoretical journal entry
[04:46:28 - 04:46:28] here okay and now i
[04:46:28 - 04:46:31] see the revert because that's
[04:46:31 - 04:46:34] one fund we were talking
[04:46:34 - 04:46:34] about and now this is
[04:46:34 - 04:46:36] converting that other fund to
[04:46:36 - 04:46:40] this particular report and that's
[04:46:40 - 04:46:42] why it increases our fund
[04:46:42 - 04:46:43] balance i think i might
[04:46:43 - 04:46:44] have misheard you on the
[04:46:45 - 04:46:45] phone or maybe i got
[04:46:45 - 04:46:47] we got the entry right
[04:46:47 - 04:46:47] on the phone and and
[04:46:47 - 04:46:49] there was some confusion but
[04:46:49 - 04:46:51] to reverse the liability we
[04:46:51 - 04:46:51] increase fund balance liability we
[04:46:51 - 04:46:51] increase fund balance right right
[04:46:53 - 04:46:53] so this is really a
[04:46:53 - 04:46:54] credit to the fund balance
[04:46:54 - 04:46:56] correct correct correct because it's
[04:46:56 - 04:46:56] a reversal of something we
[04:46:59 - 04:46:59] booked on another set that
[04:46:59 - 04:47:03] when we have to convert
[04:47:03 - 04:47:03] that set over to this
[04:47:03 - 04:47:05] format it doesn't appear it
[04:47:05 - 04:47:07] doesn't appear correct correct and
[04:47:07 - 04:47:07] that was that answers my
[04:47:07 - 04:47:09] question and i said i
[04:47:09 - 04:47:09] thought this re this entry
[04:47:10 - 04:47:12] was reversed and because of
[04:47:12 - 04:47:12] that that's why we noted
[04:47:15 - 04:47:15] before the 12 3 and
[04:47:15 - 04:47:16] then after the 12 3
[04:47:17 - 04:47:17] okay i understand okay i
[04:47:17 - 04:47:19] understand so so thank you
[04:47:19 - 04:47:20] okay board colleagues i just
[04:47:22 - 04:47:22] want to make sure that
[04:47:22 - 04:47:24] you know we want to
[04:47:24 - 04:47:24] be accounting experts but we
[04:47:24 - 04:47:27] don't need to get into
[04:47:27 - 04:47:27] the literal weed so i
[04:47:28 - 04:47:28] want to make sure that
[04:47:28 - 04:47:30] we are asking the appropriate
[04:47:30 - 04:47:33] questions trusty santos did you
[04:47:33 - 04:47:33] have a question well so
[04:47:35 - 04:47:35] i don't understand why we're
[04:47:35 - 04:47:38] doing this because it seemed
[04:47:38 - 04:47:41] like that number would just
[04:47:41 - 04:47:41] be part of employees compensation
[04:47:43 - 04:47:43] so why are we going
[04:47:43 - 04:47:44] through all this stuff but
[04:47:44 - 04:47:47] anyway well my i mean
[04:47:47 - 04:47:47] this is the this is
[04:47:47 - 04:47:50] the government accounting standard board
[04:47:50 - 04:47:52] who is instructing us with
[04:47:52 - 04:47:55] this new procedure and it's
[04:47:55 - 04:47:55] in a nutshell as you
[04:47:58 - 04:47:58] gave us some information earlier
[04:47:58 - 04:48:00] this week that we're moving
[04:48:00 - 04:48:03] it from here to there
[04:48:03 - 04:48:03] on our ledger and it's
[04:48:03 - 04:48:05] literally that simple there's no
[04:48:05 - 04:48:08] hanky panky going on this
[04:48:08 - 04:48:08] is just the way that
[04:48:08 - 04:48:11] the the government accounting standard
[04:48:11 - 04:48:14] is ordering us to use
[04:48:14 - 04:48:16] to be consistent with um
[04:48:16 - 04:48:18] gap right yes and we're
[04:48:18 - 04:48:20] in compliance and working with
[04:48:20 - 04:48:20] our district auditors we checked
[04:48:22 - 04:48:22] in with the chancellor's office
[04:48:22 - 04:48:24] so we're following all the
[04:48:24 - 04:48:25] dotting the eyes and crossing
[04:48:25 - 04:48:27] the tees and i would
[04:48:27 - 04:48:27] also note this is a
[04:48:27 - 04:48:29] one-time item so it's upon
[04:48:29 - 04:48:31] implementation of this standard so
[04:48:31 - 04:48:32] you won't see anything on
[04:48:32 - 04:48:32] this going forward unless the
[04:48:34 - 04:48:34] standard should change again in
[04:48:34 - 04:48:36] the future which they don't
[04:48:38 - 04:48:38] oh it's one time oh
[04:48:38 - 04:48:38] it's one time okay okay
[04:48:40 - 04:48:40] not every year not every
[04:48:41 - 04:48:43] year no no why are
[04:48:43 - 04:48:44] we doing it now oh
[04:48:44 - 04:48:44] interesting okay i was not
[04:48:44 - 04:48:48] aware of that all right
[04:48:48 - 04:48:48] so moving on to the
[04:48:48 - 04:48:51] next slide we will cover
[04:48:51 - 04:48:53] the unrestricted general fund overall
[04:48:53 - 04:48:56] summary and so i'll have
[04:48:56 - 04:48:56] rosa give us a general
[04:49:00 - 04:49:00] overview and i know we're
[04:49:00 - 04:49:03] on time well uh this
[04:49:03 - 04:49:03] is a new report that
[04:49:03 - 04:49:07] we haven't presented before but
[04:49:07 - 04:49:10] basically what we have here
[04:49:10 - 04:49:11] is uh well several columns
[04:49:11 - 04:49:11] we have the adopted budget
[04:49:11 - 04:49:13] columns we have the adopted
[04:49:13 - 04:49:16] budget 2425 2425 the actuals
[04:49:16 - 04:49:16] for 2425 and the adopted
[04:49:16 - 04:49:17] the actuals for 2425 and
[04:49:18 - 04:49:21] the adopted budget budget uh
[04:49:21 - 04:49:21] on the middle column or
[04:49:21 - 04:49:24] well i guess the second
[04:49:24 - 04:49:24] one what i want to
[04:49:24 - 04:49:27] point out is that our
[04:49:27 - 04:49:32] beginning balance last year was
[04:49:32 - 04:49:32] uh 71 6 six and
[04:49:32 - 04:49:35] then down below you see
[04:49:35 - 04:49:35] a number where we say
[04:49:35 - 04:49:36] is we have an ongoing
[04:49:36 - 04:49:38] surplus of ongoing surplus of
[04:49:39 - 04:49:42] 3 15158585858585858585858582 and if we
[04:49:42 - 04:49:42] go a little down below
[04:49:42 - 04:49:46] it says onetime revenues less
[04:49:46 - 04:49:47] expenditures onetime revenues less expenditures
[04:49:47 - 04:49:47] 8 871 8 871 8
[04:49:48 - 04:49:53] 871 891 891 so the
[04:49:53 - 04:49:53] deficit because we've been asked
[04:49:55 - 04:49:55] a few questions about the
[04:49:55 - 04:49:57] deficit the deficit is the
[04:49:57 - 04:50:02] difference between that 8 million
[04:50:02 - 04:50:02] 8 91 and the 3
[04:50:02 - 04:50:05] 151 that is exactly the
[04:50:05 - 04:50:09] 5 7 million deficits that
[04:50:09 - 04:50:09] we have so basically we
[04:50:09 - 04:50:13] are decreasing our fund balance
[04:50:13 - 04:50:13] uh to uh decreasing our
[04:50:14 - 04:50:14] fund balance uh to uh
[04:50:15 - 04:50:17] 65 9 65 9 the
[04:50:17 - 04:50:17] number is not shown there
[04:50:17 - 04:50:22] but the 65 9 gets
[04:50:22 - 04:50:22] increased by the 12 3
[04:50:22 - 04:50:24] million that we just discussed
[04:50:24 - 04:50:29] as a result of the
[04:50:29 - 04:50:29] gas fee and that 12
[04:50:29 - 04:50:33] 3 million is just an
[04:50:33 - 04:50:33] accounting entry on this set
[04:50:33 - 04:50:36] of financial statements which is
[04:50:36 - 04:50:37] the fund accounting the unrestricted
[04:50:37 - 04:50:40] general fund that 12 million
[04:50:40 - 04:50:43] is being transferred to our
[04:50:43 - 04:50:45] other set of financial statements
[04:50:45 - 04:50:45] that we do we when
[04:50:47 - 04:50:47] we consolidate all the funds
[04:50:47 - 04:50:51] and the auditors assist us
[04:50:51 - 04:50:51] to do that and we
[04:50:54 - 04:50:54] bring that report in december
[04:50:57 - 04:50:57] um the other one is
[04:50:57 - 04:51:01] the other column is the
[04:51:01 - 04:51:01] adopted budget 2526 and on
[04:51:01 - 04:51:05] that one basically uh we
[04:51:05 - 04:51:05] are uh showing the 3
[04:51:05 - 04:51:08] 1 million um deficit that
[04:51:08 - 04:51:10] we show also we're going
[04:51:10 - 04:51:10] to show that in a
[04:51:10 - 04:51:12] little bit and you can
[04:51:12 - 04:51:12] see the fund balance the
[04:51:14 - 04:51:14] ending fund balance for the
[04:51:14 - 04:51:17] adopted budget is 71 88
[04:51:19 - 04:51:19] or 71 9 and we're
[04:51:19 - 04:51:22] going to see that again
[04:51:22 - 04:51:25] in another report here we
[04:51:25 - 04:51:29] have the ongoing budget assumptions
[04:51:29 - 04:51:29] and uh as we always
[04:51:29 - 04:51:31] do we start with last
[04:51:31 - 04:51:34] year's ongoing revenue budget 295
[04:51:37 - 04:51:37] million 8 eight and just
[04:51:37 - 04:51:39] uh some highlights here the
[04:51:39 - 04:51:42] most important one being the
[04:51:42 - 04:51:42] 100 million that we have
[04:51:45 - 04:51:45] already talked uh joe uh
[04:51:45 - 04:51:49] talk about this this is
[04:51:49 - 04:51:52] the 1 351 uh ftees
[04:51:52 - 04:51:52] that we we got paid
[04:51:52 - 04:51:56] as a result of these
[04:51:56 - 04:51:56] 100 million and is 10
[04:51:56 - 04:51:59] million and the next line
[04:51:59 - 04:52:01] item is also important because
[04:52:01 - 04:52:01] at this point we're budgeting
[04:52:04 - 04:52:04] the two point 2 2
[04:52:04 - 04:52:06] 3 increase on our rates
[04:52:06 - 04:52:06] for the student centered funding
[04:52:10 - 04:52:10] formula which is 6 5
[04:52:10 - 04:52:12] million for this year we
[04:52:12 - 04:52:12] have a total ongoing revenue
[04:52:15 - 04:52:17] budget of 317 2 million
[04:52:17 - 04:52:17] almost and now we're going
[04:52:17 - 04:52:20] to go and look into
[04:52:20 - 04:52:23] the expenditures so on our
[04:52:23 - 04:52:25] expenditures assumptions we also going
[04:52:25 - 04:52:25] to do some highlights here
[04:52:28 - 04:52:28] the ongoing expenditure budget starting
[04:52:30 - 04:52:31] at 288 4 at 288
[04:52:31 - 04:52:36] 4 million million uh we
[04:52:36 - 04:52:36] have included a 2 3
[04:52:36 - 04:52:39] increase for all the employee
[04:52:39 - 04:52:41] groups and they are we're
[04:52:41 - 04:52:41] still negotiating i think they
[04:52:43 - 04:52:43] settled and we're going to
[04:52:43 - 04:52:45] do the adjustment the adjust
[04:52:45 - 04:52:48] the corresponding adjustments this was
[04:52:48 - 04:52:50] at the time we were
[04:52:50 - 04:52:50] doing the budget which has
[04:52:50 - 04:52:54] been more than a week
[04:52:54 - 04:52:54] ago uh then we also
[04:52:56 - 04:52:56] have here an important increase
[04:52:56 - 04:53:00] for our full-time faculty 2
[04:53:00 - 04:53:03] 5 million as a result
[04:53:03 - 04:53:03] of earning the 10 million
[04:53:03 - 04:53:05] we have to increase our
[04:53:05 - 04:53:05] faculty to meet our fund
[04:53:05 - 04:53:05] to increase our faculty to
[04:53:06 - 04:53:06] meet our fund obligation obligation
[04:53:09 - 04:53:09] and then we are also
[04:53:09 - 04:53:13] adjusting our faculty uh by
[04:53:13 - 04:53:15] about 3 3 million and
[04:53:15 - 04:53:15] then in addition within the
[04:53:15 - 04:53:18] budget as i mentioned uh
[04:53:18 - 04:53:21] we have vacancies and benefits
[04:53:21 - 04:53:21] uh budgeted so we're working
[04:53:24 - 04:53:24] the vps with president with
[04:53:24 - 04:53:26] our president on hiring prioritization
[04:53:26 - 04:53:28] list and filling some of
[04:53:28 - 04:53:31] those vacancies and so that
[04:53:31 - 04:53:33] work is underway and at
[04:53:33 - 04:53:33] the bottom we have a
[04:53:33 - 04:53:35] 2 8 million because we
[04:53:35 - 04:53:35] have to increase our rate
[04:53:38 - 04:53:38] driven due to our increases
[04:53:38 - 04:53:41] in utilities the shortfall on
[04:53:41 - 04:53:41] our utilities was 2 3
[04:53:45 - 04:53:45] million so we have a
[04:53:45 - 04:53:49] total expenditure budget of 320
[04:53:49 - 04:53:51] million 3 and now we're
[04:53:51 - 04:53:51] going to be looking into
[04:53:54 - 04:53:54] our one time uh well
[04:53:54 - 04:53:55] actually first we're going to
[04:53:55 - 04:53:58] look at the ongoing deficit
[04:53:58 - 04:53:58] i pointed out this on
[04:53:58 - 04:54:01] a previous slide our total
[04:54:01 - 04:54:04] ongoing revenue less our ongoing
[04:54:04 - 04:54:07] expenditures is what makes uh
[04:54:07 - 04:54:10] the ongoing budget deficit of
[04:54:10 - 04:54:13] 3 1 million and here
[04:54:13 - 04:54:13] we have the one-time revenue
[04:54:16 - 04:54:16] and expenditure assumptions on top
[04:54:16 - 04:54:19] we just uh mentioned that
[04:54:19 - 04:54:23] there is three 39 9
[04:54:23 - 04:54:23] million statewide for a 0
[04:54:23 - 04:54:27] 57 growth for mount sack
[04:54:27 - 04:54:29] that is estimated at 2
[04:54:29 - 04:54:29] 8 million if we earn
[04:54:29 - 04:54:32] the whole thing however mount
[04:54:32 - 04:54:34] sack doesn't budget for the
[04:54:34 - 04:54:36] growth until he's earn it
[04:54:36 - 04:54:36] so we make a note
[04:54:36 - 04:54:39] there but we don't budget
[04:54:39 - 04:54:39] for that then the reversal
[04:54:42 - 04:54:42] of the cashing county treasury
[04:54:42 - 04:54:45] this is another gas fee
[04:54:45 - 04:54:45] and this is the one
[04:54:45 - 04:54:48] that comes every year back
[04:54:48 - 04:54:48] and forth is 3 2
[04:54:50 - 04:54:50] million so we have total
[04:54:50 - 04:54:53] one time revenues for 3
[04:54:53 - 04:54:59] 2 and on the um
[04:54:59 - 04:54:59] expenditure side a couple of
[04:54:59 - 04:55:02] items to look is the
[04:55:02 - 04:55:06] ope contribution we didn't make
[04:55:06 - 04:55:06] an a contribution in the
[04:55:06 - 04:55:08] 2023 24 fiscal year so
[04:55:08 - 04:55:11] we're making the contribution this
[04:55:11 - 04:55:14] year and uh compensated absences
[04:55:14 - 04:55:18] we do have uh we're
[04:55:18 - 04:55:18] no longer able to acrewue
[04:55:18 - 04:55:20] any of these expenditures on
[04:55:20 - 04:55:23] our books so we have
[04:55:23 - 04:55:23] to set up a pay
[04:55:23 - 04:55:28] as you go budget now
[04:55:28 - 04:55:28] when we have to pay
[04:55:28 - 04:55:31] for um vacation we have
[04:55:31 - 04:55:31] to sometime cash the low
[04:55:31 - 04:55:34] banking or we have to
[04:55:34 - 04:55:34] provide back field for low
[04:55:38 - 04:55:38] banking and we also have
[04:55:38 - 04:55:42] to pay uh you know
[04:55:42 - 04:55:42] uh other expenditures for for
[04:55:42 - 04:55:45] that so the total uh
[04:55:45 - 04:55:52] onetime expenditure budget is 5
[04:55:52 - 04:55:52] 5 million and then um
[04:55:55 - 04:55:55] the next one is our
[04:55:55 - 04:55:57] revenue generated accounts we also
[04:55:57 - 04:56:01] have a question here this
[04:56:01 - 04:56:04] is basically our self-funded um
[04:56:04 - 04:56:06] revenues and self-funded programs such
[04:56:06 - 04:56:06] as the community services program
[04:56:11 - 04:56:11] on a lot of these
[04:56:11 - 04:56:16] uh you know programs for
[04:56:16 - 04:56:16] uh our students you for
[04:56:16 - 04:56:19] different uh areas chemistry the
[04:56:19 - 04:56:22] forensic team etc we get
[04:56:22 - 04:56:22] donations and we get uh
[04:56:25 - 04:56:25] fundraising money from the foundation
[04:56:29 - 04:56:29] and all that is recorded
[04:56:29 - 04:56:32] in this fund and uh
[04:56:32 - 04:56:32] down here is our compliance
[04:56:32 - 04:56:36] with our board policy 60
[04:56:36 - 04:56:36] to 50 we need to
[04:56:41 - 04:56:41] have uh at least 10
[04:56:41 - 04:56:43] of our expenditures is shown
[04:56:43 - 04:56:47] here 33 uh 33 million
[04:56:47 - 04:56:47] and on top of that
[04:56:47 - 04:56:50] a few years ago we
[04:56:50 - 04:56:54] were directed by the chancellor's
[04:56:54 - 04:56:54] office to have an 18
[04:56:54 - 04:56:57] 5 when we closed the
[04:56:57 - 04:56:59] books and at this point
[04:56:59 - 04:56:59] we are at 21 78
[04:57:02 - 04:57:05] or 71 8 million so
[04:57:05 - 04:57:05] we are over the 18
[04:57:06 - 04:57:10] 5 required for that one
[04:57:10 - 04:57:12] thing again to to that
[04:57:12 - 04:57:12] we want to point and
[04:57:12 - 04:57:15] we keep uh coming back
[04:57:15 - 04:57:15] to the gsb 101 the
[04:57:15 - 04:57:18] reason that we have that
[04:57:18 - 04:57:21] 21 78 is because the
[04:57:21 - 04:57:24] 12 million was included as
[04:57:24 - 04:57:24] part of that beginning balance
[04:57:27 - 04:57:27] eventually it's going to go
[04:57:27 - 04:57:29] away so if we didn't
[04:57:29 - 04:57:29] have that we will be
[04:57:29 - 04:57:33] only at 18 53 this
[04:57:33 - 04:57:36] year and also like to
[04:57:36 - 04:57:38] just commend uh mount sack
[04:57:38 - 04:57:38] uh this is also a
[04:57:38 - 04:57:40] reason why we're able to
[04:57:40 - 04:57:40] take on the deferrals uh
[04:57:40 - 04:57:43] for the strong fiscal management
[04:57:43 - 04:57:46] and leadership um quick question
[04:57:46 - 04:57:49] about the the fund balance
[04:57:49 - 04:57:49] um there was a comment
[04:57:52 - 04:57:52] earlier that the the district's
[04:57:52 - 04:57:56] fund balance was uh over
[04:57:56 - 04:57:59] 18 5 and the way
[04:57:59 - 04:57:59] i heard that comment was
[04:58:02 - 04:58:02] that that's a negative uh
[04:58:02 - 04:58:04] but that's not the case
[04:58:04 - 04:58:04] right it just is this
[04:58:04 - 04:58:07] is our rainy day fund
[04:58:07 - 04:58:09] is that correct and so
[04:58:09 - 04:58:09] the fact is that we
[04:58:09 - 04:58:14] have increased our rainy day
[04:58:14 - 04:58:14] fund it's now at 21
[04:58:14 - 04:58:17] 78 and so that's a
[04:58:17 - 04:58:17] good thing and so it
[04:58:17 - 04:58:20] is that where where we
[04:58:20 - 04:58:22] can withstand any kind of
[04:58:22 - 04:58:27] budget um destabilization we are
[04:58:27 - 04:58:27] we're hoping that would help
[04:58:30 - 04:58:30] prevent any kind of potential
[04:58:30 - 04:58:32] layoffs if that's ever even
[04:58:32 - 04:58:32] a threat this helps us
[04:58:35 - 04:58:35] with deferred maintenance right and
[04:58:37 - 04:58:37] that's the reason why this
[04:58:37 - 04:58:40] board wants to be a
[04:58:40 - 04:58:43] little more conservative and increase
[04:58:43 - 04:58:43] and go beyond the 18
[04:58:43 - 04:58:45] 5 would that be a
[04:58:45 - 04:58:47] correct statement correct and it
[04:58:47 - 04:58:50] allows us to support student
[04:58:50 - 04:58:50] success invest our dollars and
[04:58:52 - 04:58:52] support the the great work
[04:58:52 - 04:58:55] that's being done but also
[04:58:55 - 04:58:55] to your point that you
[04:58:57 - 04:58:59] mentioned any unforeseen fiscal conditions
[04:58:59 - 04:58:59] from the state or our
[04:59:02 - 04:59:02] legislature um so i think
[04:59:02 - 04:59:04] you know as we talked
[04:59:04 - 04:59:06] about transitional k that almost
[04:59:06 - 04:59:07] happened where that funding almost
[04:59:07 - 04:59:07] left the community college system
[04:59:09 - 04:59:09] and went to k12 but
[04:59:09 - 04:59:14] it then it came back
[04:59:14 - 04:59:14] so the impact for uh
[04:59:14 - 04:59:15] our a child center for
[04:59:15 - 04:59:17] the four-year-olds that could have
[04:59:17 - 04:59:17] impacted us and then we
[04:59:17 - 04:59:18] would have a conversation is
[04:59:18 - 04:59:20] that something that mount sack
[04:59:20 - 04:59:20] would like to continue and
[04:59:22 - 04:59:22] that gives us an opportunity
[04:59:22 - 04:59:25] but yes it's to navigate
[04:59:25 - 04:59:28] unforeseen fiscal conditions for example
[04:59:28 - 04:59:31] we're able to go with
[04:59:31 - 04:59:31] a deferral of 8 5
[04:59:31 - 04:59:33] million because we have sufficient
[04:59:33 - 04:59:36] reserves we don't have to
[04:59:36 - 04:59:38] do any borrowing and that
[04:59:38 - 04:59:41] will not impact anyone's paycheck
[04:59:41 - 04:59:41] uh vacation sick time it's
[04:59:43 - 04:59:43] it doesn't impact employees or
[04:59:43 - 04:59:46] any student anything in the
[04:59:46 - 04:59:49] classroom so thank you you're
[04:59:49 - 04:59:51] welcome question but the fund
[04:59:51 - 04:59:54] is if you subtract the
[04:59:54 - 04:59:56] 12 3 million is actually
[04:59:56 - 04:59:56] just a tad above 18
[04:59:56 - 04:59:57] 53 actually just a tad
[04:59:57 - 04:59:57] above 18 53 right right
[04:59:57 - 05:00:01] right yes yes so we're
[05:00:01 - 05:00:04] not actually exceeding our board
[05:00:04 - 05:00:04] policy 6250 by any significant
[05:00:04 - 05:00:04] board policy 6250 by any
[05:00:04 - 05:00:05] significant amount amount amount correct
[05:00:05 - 05:00:09] correct correct correct correct okay
[05:00:09 - 05:00:09] and then just in i
[05:00:09 - 05:00:11] know many of you are
[05:00:11 - 05:00:11] new but historically what kind
[05:00:14 - 05:00:14] of deferrals has mount sachs
[05:00:14 - 05:00:15] seen like right now we're
[05:00:15 - 05:00:15] facing a 12 11 to
[05:00:16 - 05:00:18] 12 million deferral this is
[05:00:18 - 05:00:21] a small this is very
[05:00:21 - 05:00:21] very small uh compared to
[05:00:21 - 05:00:24] other deferrals maybe going seven
[05:00:24 - 05:00:27] or eight years at least
[05:00:27 - 05:00:27] oh my god the deferrals
[05:00:28 - 05:00:29] were huge i remember when
[05:00:29 - 05:00:29] i was on the school
[05:00:32 - 05:00:32] board in hassuente the deferrals
[05:00:32 - 05:00:32] were board in hassuente the
[05:00:32 - 05:00:33] deferrals were massive massive massive
[05:00:33 - 05:00:34] yes yes yes yes yes
[05:00:36 - 05:00:36] you know it would be
[05:00:36 - 05:00:38] two three months that you
[05:00:38 - 05:00:38] would need to to make
[05:00:38 - 05:00:40] up and uh it was
[05:00:40 - 05:00:43] conversations with district auditors in
[05:00:43 - 05:00:45] fund borrowing can we borrow
[05:00:45 - 05:00:45] one time from this fund
[05:00:45 - 05:00:47] and then put it back
[05:00:47 - 05:00:48] three months six months down
[05:00:48 - 05:00:48] the road till we get
[05:00:48 - 05:00:49] the state payment yes those
[05:00:49 - 05:00:53] are challenging times some of
[05:00:53 - 05:00:53] the board members remember uh
[05:00:53 - 05:00:57] we had to issue tr
[05:00:57 - 05:01:00] one year in 2012 we
[05:01:00 - 05:01:00] have to issue tr to
[05:01:00 - 05:01:02] be able to get through
[05:01:02 - 05:01:02] the end of the year
[05:01:02 - 05:01:03] because we only have enough
[05:01:04 - 05:01:06] cash right and then we
[05:01:06 - 05:01:08] should always expect our fund
[05:01:08 - 05:01:11] balance to increase every single
[05:01:11 - 05:01:11] year if our actually our
[05:01:12 - 05:01:12] operating budget and expenses increase
[05:01:15 - 05:01:15] every year right it will
[05:01:15 - 05:01:19] move in tandem 18 5
[05:01:19 - 05:01:19] minimum so that fund balance
[05:01:21 - 05:01:21] naturally if our expenditures and
[05:01:24 - 05:01:24] revenues are going up that
[05:01:24 - 05:01:26] fund balance will also increase
[05:01:28 - 05:01:28] correct and i think also
[05:01:28 - 05:01:31] too with the state uh
[05:01:31 - 05:01:31] allocation is dependent so to
[05:01:32 - 05:01:34] your point yes yeah so
[05:01:34 - 05:01:34] i know some people criticize
[05:01:34 - 05:01:36] our fund balance for always
[05:01:36 - 05:01:39] increasing but we have you
[05:01:39 - 05:01:39] know our great faculty staff
[05:01:41 - 05:01:41] etc for making mount sack
[05:01:41 - 05:01:43] the kind of college that
[05:01:43 - 05:01:47] has increased enrollment that has
[05:01:47 - 05:01:47] uh increased uh you know
[05:01:48 - 05:01:50] a revenue but as a
[05:01:50 - 05:01:52] consequence of that well yeah
[05:01:52 - 05:01:52] then that fund balance will
[05:01:55 - 05:01:55] also increase so it's not
[05:01:55 - 05:01:57] necessarily a negative thing or
[05:01:57 - 05:01:59] that we're hoarding and i
[05:01:59 - 05:01:59] think this also commendable to
[05:02:02 - 05:02:02] once again to mount sack
[05:02:02 - 05:02:05] this also assisted us in
[05:02:05 - 05:02:07] getting a top credit rating
[05:02:07 - 05:02:07] in our bonds um for
[05:02:07 - 05:02:10] our community members and lowering
[05:02:10 - 05:02:12] saving taxpayer dollars so that
[05:02:12 - 05:02:15] also contributed so the the
[05:02:15 - 05:02:15] the fiscal stability amount sat
[05:02:18 - 05:02:18] with the reserves and any
[05:02:18 - 05:02:21] balance uh definitely helps thank
[05:02:22 - 05:02:24] you and so as we
[05:02:24 - 05:02:27] mentioned santos has a quick
[05:02:27 - 05:02:32] question five our ending balance
[05:02:32 - 05:02:36] was 78 million i'm looking
[05:02:36 - 05:02:44] at slide what 16 since
[05:02:44 - 05:02:47] we settled negotiations very late
[05:02:54 - 05:02:54] for i guess 23 24
[05:02:54 - 05:02:59] we paid in 2425 some
[05:02:59 - 05:02:59] of the pre previous years
[05:03:03 - 05:03:03] compensation from 2425 remember compensation
[05:03:03 - 05:03:04] from 2425 remember we we
[05:03:09 - 05:03:09] in 2425 we pay half
[05:03:09 - 05:03:11] of the retro that was
[05:03:11 - 05:03:13] from 2324 how much was
[05:03:13 - 05:03:14] that more or less over
[05:03:14 - 05:03:17] 9 million over 9 million
[05:03:19 - 05:03:23] okay so so if we
[05:03:23 - 05:03:23] would have paid that in
[05:03:23 - 05:03:25] when when it was earned
[05:03:25 - 05:03:25] we would have had 9
[05:03:34 - 05:03:34] no no in 20 in
[05:03:34 - 05:03:34] 23 24 we ended up
[05:03:34 - 05:03:39] with a big um fund
[05:03:39 - 05:03:41] balance because we only pay
[05:03:41 - 05:03:43] 4 11 of the 8
[05:03:43 - 05:03:43] 22 of the 8 22
[05:03:44 - 05:03:47] right right but during 2425
[05:03:50 - 05:03:50] we have to pay that
[05:03:50 - 05:03:55] 411 that we didn't pay
[05:03:55 - 05:03:55] so our ending balance was
[05:03:55 - 05:03:58] really 65 when you're looking
[05:03:58 - 05:04:00] at the 78 it's because
[05:04:00 - 05:04:00] the 12 3 million it's
[05:04:01 - 05:04:02] because the 12 3 million
[05:04:02 - 05:04:06] accounting accounting you know gas
[05:04:06 - 05:04:06] via standard that we keep
[05:04:08 - 05:04:08] talking so it's better to
[05:04:08 - 05:04:11] look at the 65 because
[05:04:11 - 05:04:11] that's more of a realistic
[05:04:14 - 05:04:17] number the 12 3 i
[05:04:17 - 05:04:20] know it's very confusing it's
[05:04:20 - 05:04:20] difficult for uh you know
[05:04:20 - 05:04:24] it's a very technical um
[05:04:24 - 05:04:28] entry to try to explain
[05:04:28 - 05:04:28] this is the financial statements
[05:04:31 - 05:04:31] for the fund balance and
[05:04:31 - 05:04:33] this is the other financial
[05:04:33 - 05:04:36] statements that we also have
[05:04:36 - 05:04:36] to do and kind of
[05:04:36 - 05:04:37] excuse the the fund balance
[05:04:39 - 05:04:39] okay but you're saying we
[05:04:39 - 05:04:43] had a deficit at the
[05:04:43 - 05:04:43] end of 2425 that we
[05:04:46 - 05:04:46] yeah we have a 5
[05:04:46 - 05:04:47] 7 million deficit if you
[05:04:47 - 05:04:50] added okay but if we
[05:04:50 - 05:04:52] would have paid the compensation
[05:04:52 - 05:04:56] in 2324 we wouldn't have
[05:04:56 - 05:04:56] had that deficit in 2425
[05:05:01 - 05:05:01] we maybe not but we
[05:05:01 - 05:05:01] would have a a a
[05:05:04 - 05:05:06] smaller fund balance a a
[05:05:06 - 05:05:06] smaller beginning balance a a
[05:05:06 - 05:05:07] smaller beginning balance exactly exactly
[05:05:08 - 05:05:08] yeah but we probably wouldn't
[05:05:08 - 05:05:08] have had yeah but we
[05:05:09 - 05:05:09] probably wouldn't have had that
[05:05:09 - 05:05:11] that it would be more
[05:05:11 - 05:05:11] more consistent you're it would
[05:05:11 - 05:05:12] be more more consistent you're
[05:05:12 - 05:05:12] correct correct correct yeah yeah
[05:05:15 - 05:05:15] yeah so at that point
[05:05:15 - 05:05:18] in time to to split
[05:05:18 - 05:05:18] it it was determined then
[05:05:18 - 05:05:20] but there were some scenarios
[05:05:20 - 05:05:22] whether to split it by
[05:05:22 - 05:05:22] fiscal year but you're split
[05:05:23 - 05:05:24] it by fiscal year but
[05:05:24 - 05:05:27] you're correct correct yeah so
[05:05:27 - 05:05:27] if we would have paid
[05:05:27 - 05:05:30] when it was earned we
[05:05:30 - 05:05:33] wouldn't have had a deficit
[05:05:33 - 05:05:36] in 2425 and i think
[05:05:36 - 05:05:36] thank you to our our
[05:05:36 - 05:05:38] uh union leaders and stakeholders
[05:05:38 - 05:05:41] uh for being flexible because
[05:05:41 - 05:05:42] that helped mount sack so
[05:05:42 - 05:05:44] sack so trustee trustee trustee
[05:05:44 - 05:05:49] do do trusty chen do
[05:05:49 - 05:05:49] you want to allow mr
[05:05:49 - 05:05:50] dominguez to finish all the
[05:05:50 - 05:05:53] way and hold the questions
[05:05:53 - 05:05:53] or i have some questions
[05:05:53 - 05:05:54] but i think it might
[05:05:54 - 05:05:54] be better if we just
[05:05:55 - 05:05:55] let you finish to the
[05:05:56 - 05:05:58] end we're on slide what
[05:05:58 - 05:06:00] 23 and we have about
[05:06:00 - 05:06:02] 10 more let's go okay
[05:06:02 - 05:06:02] so we're wrapping up here
[05:06:02 - 05:06:04] so um but yes we
[05:06:04 - 05:06:06] are uh committed to students
[05:06:06 - 05:06:06] we are in the success
[05:06:06 - 05:06:09] of people and the people
[05:06:09 - 05:06:11] business so 86 of our
[05:06:11 - 05:06:12] of all expenditures on the
[05:06:14 - 05:06:14] unrestricted general fund are salary
[05:06:14 - 05:06:18] and benefits so uh from
[05:06:18 - 05:06:21] our revenue on the left
[05:06:21 - 05:06:21] hand side we get 78
[05:06:21 - 05:06:25] 2 million which is about
[05:06:25 - 05:06:25] 24 from property taxes our
[05:06:29 - 05:06:29] educational protection account at 47
[05:06:29 - 05:06:32] 9 which is about 15
[05:06:32 - 05:06:36] our state aortionment 154 2
[05:06:36 - 05:06:36] at 48 and then you
[05:06:38 - 05:06:38] see the smaller amounts from
[05:06:38 - 05:06:41] uh non-resident our lottery and
[05:06:41 - 05:06:44] then uh thank you president
[05:06:44 - 05:06:46] garcia lottery will no longer
[05:06:46 - 05:06:46] be used for utilities it'll
[05:06:48 - 05:06:48] be dedicated for educational supplies
[05:06:50 - 05:06:50] and so we also made
[05:06:50 - 05:06:53] that adjustment on the expenditure
[05:06:53 - 05:06:53] side uh as i mentioned
[05:06:55 - 05:06:55] we have capital outlay uh
[05:06:55 - 05:06:58] insurance utilities legal supplies and
[05:06:58 - 05:07:01] materials and then our employees
[05:07:01 - 05:07:05] benefits at 24 77 7
[05:07:05 - 05:07:05] million our classified salaries at
[05:07:09 - 05:07:09] 73 2 at 22 and
[05:07:09 - 05:07:13] our academic salaries at 133
[05:07:13 - 05:07:16] 1 at 40 and then
[05:07:16 - 05:07:16] in in summary as a
[05:07:16 - 05:07:18] whole the big picture so
[05:07:18 - 05:07:18] what we connected on was
[05:07:21 - 05:07:21] on the unrestricted general fund
[05:07:21 - 05:07:22] but i thought it was
[05:07:22 - 05:07:25] important to highlight the other
[05:07:25 - 05:07:25] funds that we have and
[05:07:25 - 05:07:27] oversee and we're public fiscal
[05:07:27 - 05:07:29] stewards of these funds and
[05:07:29 - 05:07:29] we want to make sure
[05:07:31 - 05:07:31] that we maintain fiscal solveny
[05:07:31 - 05:07:35] so here's a summary of
[05:07:35 - 05:07:39] all the funds there and
[05:07:39 - 05:07:39] so at total for 2526
[05:07:42 - 05:07:44] 190 6 million and then
[05:07:44 - 05:07:44] for future budget challenges as
[05:07:48 - 05:07:48] i mentioned uh the tax
[05:07:48 - 05:07:50] structure on the higher income
[05:07:50 - 05:07:50] the small group of higher
[05:07:53 - 05:07:53] income taxpayers were u reliant
[05:07:53 - 05:07:56] on that and that is
[05:07:56 - 05:07:58] also a challenge inflation as
[05:07:58 - 05:07:58] cost of operations and goods
[05:07:58 - 05:08:01] rise uh here in california
[05:08:01 - 05:08:03] and then the fiscal uh
[05:08:03 - 05:08:03] policy turbulence uh that we're
[05:08:03 - 05:08:08] going through from trio pel
[05:08:08 - 05:08:11] adult ed uh be becoming
[05:08:11 - 05:08:11] or um we still are
[05:08:11 - 05:08:13] a hsi institution but we
[05:08:13 - 05:08:16] no longer get the federal
[05:08:16 - 05:08:16] funding for it uh starting
[05:08:16 - 05:08:18] 2526 the annual cost of
[05:08:18 - 05:08:20] living adjustments uh the cola
[05:08:20 - 05:08:23] student centered funding formula are
[05:08:23 - 05:08:23] set to expire um for
[05:08:26 - 05:08:26] declining or districts that are
[05:08:26 - 05:08:27] um stagnant that's going to
[05:08:27 - 05:08:30] be a bigger challenge uh
[05:08:30 - 05:08:32] for growing districts uh that'll
[05:08:32 - 05:08:32] be helpful but i mean
[05:08:32 - 05:08:33] it's just a challenge overall
[05:08:33 - 05:08:35] and i mentioned the parking
[05:08:35 - 05:08:38] revenue the the 1 2
[05:08:38 - 05:08:38] shortfall so that'll be uh
[05:08:38 - 05:08:40] from our general fund and
[05:08:40 - 05:08:42] then no deferred maintenance uh
[05:08:42 - 05:08:45] funding or instruction equipment and
[05:08:45 - 05:08:45] i know the lobbyists are
[05:08:46 - 05:08:46] are reaching out to the
[05:08:46 - 05:08:49] governor and the legislature uh
[05:08:49 - 05:08:49] when is it going to
[05:08:49 - 05:08:52] be reinstated so but as
[05:08:52 - 05:08:55] of right now 2526 that's
[05:08:55 - 05:08:55] not in there and then
[05:08:55 - 05:08:57] uh kudos to the trustees
[05:08:57 - 05:09:00] and our president continuing funding
[05:09:00 - 05:09:02] oped contribution and our retirees
[05:09:02 - 05:09:05] health premiums and healthcare costs
[05:09:05 - 05:09:05] and want to say thank
[05:09:05 - 05:09:06] healthcare costs and want to
[05:09:06 - 05:09:08] say thank you you open
[05:09:08 - 05:09:08] it up to additional questions
[05:09:18 - 05:09:18] an ongoing uh challenge for
[05:09:18 - 05:09:25] us what's the feeling um
[05:09:25 - 05:09:25] about it i mean is
[05:09:25 - 05:09:27] it that it's crucial i
[05:09:27 - 05:09:29] i think um of course
[05:09:29 - 05:09:31] but how's the governor and
[05:09:31 - 05:09:33] some of the legislators perceiving
[05:09:33 - 05:09:35] it i believe um they're
[05:09:35 - 05:09:37] definitely hearing that it's a
[05:09:37 - 05:09:40] challenge uh they're talking about
[05:09:40 - 05:09:40] maybe a smaller portion of
[05:09:43 - 05:09:43] the educational equipment um facilities
[05:09:45 - 05:09:45] funding but those are just
[05:09:46 - 05:09:46] conversations nothing's been set so
[05:09:46 - 05:09:48] i think it's some of
[05:09:48 - 05:09:51] them actually thinking that local
[05:09:51 - 05:09:55] entities should cover that i
[05:09:55 - 05:09:55] think that's the piece uh
[05:09:55 - 05:09:58] it's on our own right
[05:09:58 - 05:09:58] now and so local colleges
[05:09:58 - 05:10:01] are covering their own so
[05:10:01 - 05:10:02] that's been the what we
[05:10:02 - 05:10:02] have been trying to do
[05:10:05 - 05:10:05] and we do cover quite
[05:10:05 - 05:10:05] a bit of it anyway
[05:10:05 - 05:10:05] and we do cover quite
[05:10:05 - 05:10:05] a bit of it anyway
[05:10:05 - 05:10:07] but but we cover a
[05:10:07 - 05:10:07] very portion i from my
[05:10:08 - 05:10:08] understanding and looking at the
[05:10:10 - 05:10:10] previous budget documents i think
[05:10:10 - 05:10:13] it was like 20 million
[05:10:13 - 05:10:16] plus in previous years and
[05:10:16 - 05:10:16] so we're only chipping in
[05:10:16 - 05:10:20] a sliver of that i
[05:10:20 - 05:10:20] think trusty uh chow has
[05:10:20 - 05:10:22] four i think trusty uh
[05:10:22 - 05:10:23] chow has four questions questions
[05:10:25 - 05:10:25] i'd like you to scroll
[05:10:25 - 05:10:29] back to your page 19
[05:10:29 - 05:10:29] and i'm just trying to
[05:10:29 - 05:10:31] understand the cash flow for
[05:10:31 - 05:10:32] our budget okay and i'm
[05:10:34 - 05:10:34] trying to keep it as
[05:10:34 - 05:10:37] simple as possible the page
[05:10:37 - 05:10:39] 19 if everything is actual
[05:10:39 - 05:10:41] i'm going to assume budget
[05:10:41 - 05:10:41] and actual are going to
[05:10:41 - 05:10:43] be close okay we're going
[05:10:43 - 05:10:47] to burn through 3 1
[05:10:47 - 05:10:47] million of cash with the
[05:10:47 - 05:10:50] current existing budget okay is
[05:10:50 - 05:10:56] that a reasonable comment yes
[05:10:56 - 05:10:56] we are going to have
[05:10:56 - 05:10:58] 320 then we have then
[05:10:58 - 05:10:58] i'm going to and all
[05:10:58 - 05:11:01] the next screen the one
[05:11:01 - 05:11:01] time only are not not
[05:11:05 - 05:11:05] part of the 3 1
[05:11:05 - 05:11:05] is that correct part of
[05:11:05 - 05:11:06] the 3 1 is that
[05:11:06 - 05:11:09] correct yes yes they are
[05:11:09 - 05:11:09] not part and therefore the
[05:11:12 - 05:11:12] positive this cashing county this
[05:11:12 - 05:11:15] has no impact on our
[05:11:15 - 05:11:15] cash flow because this is
[05:11:18 - 05:11:18] a book entry mark to
[05:11:18 - 05:11:20] market for our bonds correct
[05:11:22 - 05:11:22] yes it's a cash entry
[05:11:25 - 05:11:25] okay no impact on cash
[05:11:25 - 05:11:28] flow but you've omitted in
[05:11:28 - 05:11:32] here being conservative as you
[05:11:32 - 05:11:32] are the skiff increases right
[05:11:32 - 05:11:34] so we're going to leave
[05:11:34 - 05:11:38] that off right now okay
[05:11:38 - 05:11:38] so so right now we're
[05:11:38 - 05:11:40] at 3 1 million negative
[05:11:40 - 05:11:44] cash no one time only
[05:11:44 - 05:11:48] positive cash of the 5
[05:11:48 - 05:11:48] 5 million is this all
[05:11:48 - 05:11:51] negative cash or do we
[05:11:51 - 05:11:51] take out the gazsby 101
[05:11:51 - 05:11:53] on or do we take
[05:11:53 - 05:11:55] out the gazsby 101 on
[05:11:56 - 05:11:58] here because all these are
[05:11:58 - 05:12:02] one time only expenditures which
[05:12:02 - 05:12:04] will require cash yes we
[05:12:04 - 05:12:07] will pay those so i
[05:12:07 - 05:12:07] should i include the 5
[05:12:07 - 05:12:09] 5 million of cash burn
[05:12:09 - 05:12:10] here is that an accurate
[05:12:10 - 05:12:10] of cash burn here is
[05:12:10 - 05:12:11] that an accurate statement statement
[05:12:11 - 05:12:15] statement yes yes okay so
[05:12:15 - 05:12:15] now we're up to 8
[05:12:15 - 05:12:18] we're at 3 1 5
[05:12:18 - 05:12:22] 5 we're at 8 6
[05:12:22 - 05:12:24] million negative cash burn here
[05:12:24 - 05:12:24] okay and then we go
[05:12:24 - 05:12:27] to the next screen and
[05:12:27 - 05:12:31] this is some other operations
[05:12:31 - 05:12:31] we have that you know
[05:12:31 - 05:12:35] it's and this thing says
[05:12:35 - 05:12:38] the expenditures are going to
[05:12:38 - 05:12:38] exceed our revenues by 1
[05:12:40 - 05:12:40] million correct million correct yes
[05:12:40 - 05:12:43] yes therefore we go up
[05:12:43 - 05:12:46] to 9 some odd million
[05:12:46 - 05:12:46] dollar cash burn correct based
[05:12:47 - 05:12:48] upon this budget upon this
[05:12:48 - 05:12:51] budget correct correct and that's
[05:12:51 - 05:12:55] that's the end so we're
[05:12:55 - 05:12:55] if the budget is as
[05:12:55 - 05:12:58] you project it to be
[05:12:58 - 05:12:58] we're going to burn through
[05:12:58 - 05:13:01] 9 1 million of cash
[05:13:01 - 05:13:01] in the next year and
[05:13:01 - 05:13:04] we some of it will
[05:13:04 - 05:13:06] be offset by the governor's
[05:13:06 - 05:13:06] other monies but we haven't
[05:13:09 - 05:13:09] accounted for it yet right
[05:13:09 - 05:13:13] but still this is 9
[05:13:13 - 05:13:13] 1 million of cash that
[05:13:13 - 05:13:16] within this budget we're going
[05:13:16 - 05:13:19] to burn through and our
[05:13:19 - 05:13:19] reserves are only 71 million
[05:13:19 - 05:13:19] and our reserves are only
[05:13:20 - 05:13:24] 71 million okay okay this
[05:13:24 - 05:13:24] seems like an excessive burn
[05:13:24 - 05:13:27] okay i'm a little concerned
[05:13:27 - 05:13:30] now you included in this
[05:13:30 - 05:13:30] budget in this 9 some
[05:13:30 - 05:13:33] odd million burn we have
[05:13:33 - 05:13:35] deferred maintenance of about 5
[05:13:35 - 05:13:35] million is that maintenance of
[05:13:36 - 05:13:36] about 5 million is that
[05:13:36 - 05:13:37] correct correct correct yes yes
[05:13:41 - 05:13:41] okay now we have a
[05:13:41 - 05:13:43] bond that has deferred maintenance
[05:13:43 - 05:13:45] built in correct because i
[05:13:45 - 05:13:47] remember we had deferred maintenance
[05:13:47 - 05:13:47] on the bond in the
[05:13:47 - 05:13:51] bond monies so is this
[05:13:51 - 05:13:55] is this deferred maintenance and
[05:13:55 - 05:13:55] is it is it in
[05:13:55 - 05:13:59] addition to what we have
[05:13:59 - 05:14:02] allocated in our measure v
[05:14:02 - 05:14:02] or you know measure v
[05:14:02 - 05:14:03] bond v or you know
[05:14:03 - 05:14:03] measure v bond yes yes
[05:14:08 - 05:14:08] and and so so my
[05:14:08 - 05:14:08] concern to the board is
[05:14:11 - 05:14:11] based upon this before whatever
[05:14:12 - 05:14:14] windfall we get from the
[05:14:14 - 05:14:14] from the state and the
[05:14:16 - 05:14:16] the windfall from the state
[05:14:16 - 05:14:21] in this last year was
[05:14:21 - 05:14:21] 10 million and we believe
[05:14:21 - 05:14:23] it's maybe 5 million for
[05:14:23 - 05:14:25] the next year is that
[05:14:25 - 05:14:27] a reasonable projection that the
[05:14:27 - 05:14:31] state is going to give
[05:14:31 - 05:14:31] us for increases in enrollment
[05:14:33 - 05:14:33] are you talking about the
[05:14:33 - 05:14:34] growth yeah for growth yeah
[05:14:35 - 05:14:35] for growth 2 8 2
[05:14:35 - 05:14:38] 8 2 8 okay but
[05:14:38 - 05:14:38] it's possible that it could
[05:14:38 - 05:14:41] be more okay so so
[05:14:41 - 05:14:44] we're saying we're at the
[05:14:44 - 05:14:44] 9 million is set we're
[05:14:47 - 05:14:47] going to burn through 9
[05:14:47 - 05:14:49] 1 million of cash based
[05:14:49 - 05:14:49] upon what i'm seeing here
[05:14:53 - 05:14:53] we might have 2 8
[05:14:53 - 05:14:53] to offset it is this
[05:14:55 - 05:14:55] an acceptable budget i have
[05:14:55 - 05:14:58] a little difficult time with
[05:14:58 - 05:15:01] this so some of the
[05:15:01 - 05:15:01] items that i mentioned uh
[05:15:02 - 05:15:02] we have to as we're
[05:15:02 - 05:15:06] working on the prioritization list
[05:15:06 - 05:15:08] of vacancies another opportunity is
[05:15:08 - 05:15:11] reduction of utility costs uh
[05:15:11 - 05:15:14] the commitment from the general
[05:15:14 - 05:15:14] fund of the 1 9
[05:15:14 - 05:15:17] to parking um increasing facility
[05:15:17 - 05:15:20] rentals so how do we
[05:15:20 - 05:15:20] offset those cost impact um
[05:15:25 - 05:15:25] another uh piece of that
[05:15:25 - 05:15:30] is our um workers comp
[05:15:30 - 05:15:30] and uh leaves and work
[05:15:33 - 05:15:33] making sure how we uh
[05:15:33 - 05:15:36] can be more proactive with
[05:15:36 - 05:15:39] campus safety training etc to
[05:15:39 - 05:15:39] reduce the amount of injuries
[05:15:39 - 05:15:43] um on work time so
[05:15:43 - 05:15:43] that is a component and
[05:15:46 - 05:15:46] then as i mentioned uh
[05:15:46 - 05:15:49] and partnering up in collaboration
[05:15:49 - 05:15:49] not on our own is
[05:15:49 - 05:15:53] with instruction and other leadership
[05:15:53 - 05:15:55] about uh as we budgeted
[05:15:55 - 05:15:58] approximately 16 positions to meet
[05:15:58 - 05:16:01] the fawn faculty hire but
[05:16:01 - 05:16:01] we have 3 1 million
[05:16:01 - 05:16:02] of hourly but we have
[05:16:02 - 05:16:03] 3 1 million of hourly
[05:16:03 - 05:16:06] faculty faculty that just bumped
[05:16:06 - 05:16:06] up and so there's an
[05:16:08 - 05:16:08] opportunity there if we're hiring
[05:16:11 - 05:16:11] full-time faculty in theory you
[05:16:11 - 05:16:13] would reduce the hourly but
[05:16:13 - 05:16:15] that's that's work that still
[05:16:15 - 05:16:15] has to be done so
[05:16:18 - 05:16:18] that's also um underway right
[05:16:18 - 05:16:20] now so my question to
[05:16:20 - 05:16:23] mr dominguez and mroy is
[05:16:25 - 05:16:27] do you have within the
[05:16:27 - 05:16:27] parameters of what we have
[05:16:31 - 05:16:31] here do you think you
[05:16:31 - 05:16:34] could squeeze out squeeze out
[05:16:34 - 05:16:39] and reduce our expenditures by
[05:16:39 - 05:16:39] 7 million i mean that
[05:16:39 - 05:16:42] seems like a lot of
[05:16:42 - 05:16:44] money or are are we
[05:16:44 - 05:16:44] as a board going to
[05:16:47 - 05:16:47] approve this and we will
[05:16:47 - 05:16:50] live with a 9 million
[05:16:50 - 05:16:50] cash burn of out of
[05:16:50 - 05:16:52] out of our reserves because
[05:16:52 - 05:16:54] that's in theory what's going
[05:16:54 - 05:16:56] to happen here yeah so
[05:16:56 - 05:16:56] we are committed to making
[05:16:59 - 05:16:59] sure that we maintain fiscal
[05:16:59 - 05:17:01] solveny and we make adjustments
[05:17:01 - 05:17:01] we have to and and
[05:17:02 - 05:17:05] i think because this 9
[05:17:05 - 05:17:07] million cannot continue year in
[05:17:07 - 05:17:10] and year out you're correct
[05:17:10 - 05:17:10] and then as i mentioned
[05:17:13 - 05:17:13] previous we have to do
[05:17:13 - 05:17:16] better at communicating the fiscal
[05:17:16 - 05:17:20] stance of the district and
[05:17:20 - 05:17:25] explain in detail because it
[05:17:25 - 05:17:25] is uh can be difficult
[05:17:25 - 05:17:28] to follow but we do
[05:17:28 - 05:17:28] need to uh enhance communication
[05:17:30 - 05:17:30] where we can work together
[05:17:30 - 05:17:32] because i cannot do this
[05:17:32 - 05:17:32] on my own i'll be
[05:17:34 - 05:17:34] upfront and honest this is
[05:17:34 - 05:17:36] a collaborative effort with all
[05:17:36 - 05:17:38] the departments and and you
[05:17:38 - 05:17:40] know we're talking about reductions
[05:17:40 - 05:17:42] but there's also an opportunity
[05:17:42 - 05:17:45] where do we enhance revenue
[05:17:45 - 05:17:45] and i think with the
[05:17:45 - 05:17:47] skiff model and what we
[05:17:47 - 05:17:47] have how do we increase
[05:17:49 - 05:17:49] certificates how do we increase
[05:17:49 - 05:17:51] so there's also opportunity and
[05:17:51 - 05:17:53] and i'll uh okay you
[05:17:53 - 05:17:53] i think you hit it
[05:17:53 - 05:17:56] on the head here if
[05:17:56 - 05:17:56] our skiff goes up all
[05:17:56 - 05:18:00] right let's say our student
[05:18:00 - 05:18:02] enrollment goes up how much
[05:18:02 - 05:18:02] can we increase revenue right
[05:18:05 - 05:18:05] because here the assumption here
[05:18:05 - 05:18:09] is that your revenues here
[05:18:09 - 05:18:12] at 317 million assumes flat
[05:18:12 - 05:18:12] enrollment at this point in
[05:18:14 - 05:18:14] time what's the underlying assumption
[05:18:14 - 05:18:15] time what's the underlying assumption
[05:18:15 - 05:18:18] here here so flat enrollment
[05:18:18 - 05:18:18] and but we know with
[05:18:21 - 05:18:21] this slide right here the
[05:18:21 - 05:18:25] governor and legislature gave us
[05:18:25 - 05:18:27] some money to fund unfunded
[05:18:27 - 05:18:27] full-time equivalent students how much
[05:18:27 - 05:18:30] is that so there's a
[05:18:30 - 05:18:32] question mark that 810 810
[05:18:32 - 05:18:32] is unfunded right now how
[05:18:32 - 05:18:35] much is that worth dollar-wise
[05:18:35 - 05:18:37] approximately probably about 4 to
[05:18:37 - 05:18:40] 5 million 4 to 5
[05:18:40 - 05:18:43] million okay so it theoretically
[05:18:43 - 05:18:43] if we have an enrollment
[05:18:47 - 05:18:50] of 810 additional full-time equivalent
[05:18:50 - 05:18:53] students right that would be
[05:18:53 - 05:18:53] another four or 5 million
[05:18:55 - 05:18:55] and that would cover our
[05:18:55 - 05:18:56] burn and that would cover
[05:18:56 - 05:18:59] our burn theoretically theoretically and
[05:18:59 - 05:18:59] uh the funding from the
[05:18:59 - 05:19:02] state from the governor the
[05:19:02 - 05:19:03] legisle and assuming we get
[05:19:03 - 05:19:04] funded how is it that
[05:19:04 - 05:19:04] we didn't get paid for
[05:19:07 - 05:19:07] these 810 i don't understand
[05:19:07 - 05:19:10] that i thought we earned
[05:19:10 - 05:19:10] it we we hit a
[05:19:10 - 05:19:13] cap we capped okay all
[05:19:13 - 05:19:16] right so we're a victim
[05:19:16 - 05:19:16] of our own success here
[05:19:16 - 05:19:19] correct thank you i would
[05:19:19 - 05:19:22] say the the success the
[05:19:22 - 05:19:22] of our programs and students
[05:19:24 - 05:19:24] enrolling i mean it's it's
[05:19:24 - 05:19:27] a beautiful thing but the
[05:19:27 - 05:19:29] state and the legislature and
[05:19:29 - 05:19:29] their funding formula is capped
[05:19:29 - 05:19:31] at that amount and right
[05:19:31 - 05:19:33] now has our cap is
[05:19:33 - 05:19:33] our cap going to increase
[05:19:35 - 05:19:35] in the current fiscal year
[05:19:37 - 05:19:37] so now the new base
[05:19:37 - 05:19:40] has been implemented so this
[05:19:40 - 05:19:42] is our current uh funding
[05:19:42 - 05:19:44] unless the governor and legislature
[05:19:44 - 05:19:46] increase to cover the unfunded
[05:19:46 - 05:19:46] so right now we are
[05:19:46 - 05:19:48] not projected to be funded
[05:19:48 - 05:19:51] for the additional 810 or
[05:19:51 - 05:19:51] if we grow say 2
[05:19:51 - 05:19:53] 000 more students that'll be
[05:19:53 - 05:19:55] unfunded unfunded right unfunded right
[05:19:55 - 05:19:57] yes yes so we are
[05:19:57 - 05:19:57] we are at the cap
[05:19:57 - 05:19:58] at this point in time
[05:19:58 - 05:19:59] point in time yes yes
[05:20:02 - 05:20:02] so it is like not
[05:20:02 - 05:20:04] in our best interest to
[05:20:04 - 05:20:04] grow is that correct because
[05:20:04 - 05:20:06] we're going to incur more
[05:20:06 - 05:20:08] costs and not get paid
[05:20:08 - 05:20:08] is that a correct statement
[05:20:17 - 05:20:17] not necessarily not necessarily so
[05:20:17 - 05:20:19] we were just funded that
[05:20:19 - 05:20:22] that's why i mentioned we
[05:20:22 - 05:20:25] were just given the governor
[05:20:25 - 05:20:28] and legislature approved 2425 to
[05:20:28 - 05:20:28] go back in time and
[05:20:28 - 05:20:31] do a catchup and i
[05:20:31 - 05:20:31] don't know the just justification
[05:20:31 - 05:20:32] or reasoning i i wasn't
[05:20:32 - 05:20:35] in the chambers at at
[05:20:35 - 05:20:35] sacramento but that was unique
[05:20:36 - 05:20:37] for them to do that
[05:20:37 - 05:20:37] to go back in time
[05:20:37 - 05:20:39] and say community college districts
[05:20:39 - 05:20:41] we're going to help you
[05:20:41 - 05:20:41] out for 2425 and give
[05:20:44 - 05:20:44] you a chunk of money
[05:20:44 - 05:20:45] for 2526 that's never been
[05:20:45 - 05:20:48] done before well i have
[05:20:48 - 05:20:48] to believe if i may
[05:20:48 - 05:20:50] that when dr garcia myself
[05:20:50 - 05:20:53] i think dr adalgo or
[05:20:53 - 05:20:53] dr bucko we went and
[05:20:53 - 05:20:56] we adalgo or dr bucko
[05:20:58 - 05:21:02] we went and we advocators
[05:21:04 - 05:21:04] and telling them we're actually
[05:21:04 - 05:21:06] we have more students than
[05:21:06 - 05:21:08] we're getting paid for and
[05:21:08 - 05:21:08] that was one of our
[05:21:08 - 05:21:10] key messages i have to
[05:21:10 - 05:21:14] believe that there was that
[05:21:14 - 05:21:14] influenced and i know excuse
[05:21:14 - 05:21:17] me the the department of
[05:21:17 - 05:21:19] finance particularly were very curious
[05:21:19 - 05:21:23] to have us explain further
[05:21:23 - 05:21:25] our challenge i i need
[05:21:25 - 05:21:25] to have one more comment
[05:21:25 - 05:21:27] you know it it's not
[05:21:27 - 05:21:27] on your slides as in
[05:21:30 - 05:21:30] the other you know we
[05:21:30 - 05:21:34] talked about this we we
[05:21:34 - 05:21:34] we had a net operating
[05:21:34 - 05:21:40] loss of the past fiscal
[05:21:40 - 05:21:43] year 630 630 uh25 at
[05:21:43 - 05:21:47] 6 5 7 million correct
[05:21:47 - 05:21:47] 5 7 million of which
[05:21:51 - 05:21:55] when i reverse out five
[05:21:55 - 05:21:55] million for an acral for
[05:21:57 - 05:21:57] uh for deferred maintenance and
[05:21:57 - 05:22:01] 1 9 million for progress
[05:22:01 - 05:22:03] theoretically were positive cash about
[05:22:03 - 05:22:06] a million in our past
[05:22:06 - 05:22:06] fiscal year okay so i'm
[05:22:06 - 05:22:08] okay with that but i
[05:22:08 - 05:22:08] think as a board we
[05:22:10 - 05:22:10] sort of have to take
[05:22:10 - 05:22:12] a leap of faith here
[05:22:12 - 05:22:14] that we're not going to
[05:22:14 - 05:22:16] burn through 9 million but
[05:22:16 - 05:22:16] i'm i have a little
[05:22:21 - 05:22:21] difficult time with that leap
[05:22:21 - 05:22:22] of faith i don't know
[05:22:22 - 05:22:22] how my fellow trustees feel
[05:22:22 - 05:22:23] i don't know how my
[05:22:23 - 05:22:23] fellow trustees feel here here
[05:22:26 - 05:22:26] i have faith in our
[05:22:26 - 05:22:33] in our exceptional so so
[05:22:37 - 05:22:39] from 2425 to let's see
[05:22:42 - 05:22:46] we had okay 2425 all
[05:22:46 - 05:22:46] our money it was 979
[05:22:46 - 05:22:50] million and then it shows
[05:22:50 - 05:22:50] that for 2526 it's only
[05:22:52 - 05:22:54] going to be 890 i
[05:22:54 - 05:22:57] don't believe it well i
[05:22:57 - 05:22:57] think it's a conservative budget
[05:22:58 - 05:22:58] and at the end because
[05:22:58 - 05:23:01] that's what always happens we
[05:23:01 - 05:23:01] ended up we always end
[05:23:02 - 05:23:04] up with more so let
[05:23:04 - 05:23:04] me clarify so this is
[05:23:04 - 05:23:07] a point in time and
[05:23:07 - 05:23:07] what i'm going to explain
[05:23:08 - 05:23:11] here for example the bond
[05:23:11 - 05:23:13] construction uh we just got
[05:23:13 - 05:23:17] an amazing credit rating uh
[05:23:17 - 05:23:17] selling bonds so that 204
[05:23:17 - 05:23:20] and we're just proposing a
[05:23:20 - 05:23:20] 250 draw down so that
[05:23:23 - 05:23:23] number is going to bump
[05:23:23 - 05:23:23] up so this is a
[05:23:24 - 05:23:27] point in time uh on
[05:23:27 - 05:23:27] our unodudited actuals and our
[05:23:29 - 05:23:29] adopted budget but then it's
[05:23:29 - 05:23:30] going to change and then
[05:23:30 - 05:23:30] we'll bring it back and
[05:23:32 - 05:23:32] we'll update and explain the
[05:23:32 - 05:23:34] change so you're saying the
[05:23:34 - 05:23:34] 8 90 is going to
[05:23:35 - 05:23:37] bump up it's going to
[05:23:37 - 05:23:37] bump up but but bond
[05:23:40 - 05:23:40] dollars for example bond dollars
[05:23:40 - 05:23:42] can only be used for
[05:23:42 - 05:23:45] specific reasons we can't use
[05:23:45 - 05:23:45] that on so yes can't
[05:23:45 - 05:23:46] use that on so yes
[05:23:46 - 05:23:47] yeah yeah right board colleagues
[05:23:47 - 05:23:49] we want to try to
[05:23:49 - 05:23:49] wrap this up are there

[05:25:43 - 05:25:45] students um we were planning

[05:25:48 - 05:25:48] legislation for basic needs as
[05:25:48 - 05:25:51] i've heard that there have
[05:25:51 - 05:25:55] been like several complaints about
[05:25:55 - 05:25:55] it not being able to
[05:25:55 - 05:25:59] um accommodate for so many
[05:25:59 - 05:26:01] students so um it's still
[05:26:01 - 05:26:01] in the works and we're
[05:26:01 - 05:26:03] still collaborating with basic needs
[05:26:03 - 05:26:08] but hopefully um we can
[05:26:08 - 05:26:08] um try to add more
[05:26:11 - 05:26:11] donations to that area by
[05:26:11 - 05:26:15] having like a little donation
[05:26:15 - 05:26:15] box for um that students
[05:26:16 - 05:26:16] will see while they're registering

[05:27:57 - 05:27:57] some years of service um
[05:27:57 - 05:28:01] i think that blockbuster t-shirt
[05:28:01 - 05:28:01] if any of you there
[05:28:05 - 05:28:05] was really a hit and
[05:28:05 - 05:28:05] i i wish i have
[05:28:11 - 05:28:11] one but um i think
[05:28:11 - 05:28:15] we have to remember um
[05:28:15 - 05:28:18] the lesson from blockbuster you
[05:28:18 - 05:28:18] know i know many of
[05:28:18 - 05:28:23] us took our kids every
[05:28:23 - 05:28:23] friday after school it's all
[05:28:25 - 05:28:29] at blockbuster uh choosing movie
[05:28:29 - 05:28:32] tapes and um so i
[05:28:32 - 05:28:32] guess you know the the
[05:28:36 - 05:28:36] management didn't see you know
[05:28:36 - 05:28:36] lack of management didn't see
[05:28:37 - 05:28:38] you know lack of uh
[05:28:38 - 05:28:41] uh vision or whatever didn't
[05:28:41 - 05:28:45] see the the development of
[05:28:45 - 05:28:48] uh entertainment trend and all
[05:28:48 - 05:28:48] that that's why they disappear
[05:28:52 - 05:28:52] i think we need to
[05:28:52 - 05:28:54] remember that um just on
[05:28:54 - 05:28:56] the sign our student trustee
[05:28:56 - 05:29:00] she has no idea you
[05:29:00 - 05:29:00] don't know you don't know
[05:29:00 - 05:29:03] even no uh blockbuster no
[05:29:03 - 05:29:03] more i think you know
[05:29:03 - 05:29:05] the management didn't read that
[05:29:05 - 05:29:08] book you know who moved
[05:29:08 - 05:29:08] my cheese you know any
[05:29:08 - 05:29:12] of you know that book
[05:29:12 - 05:29:12] um but any of you

[05:31:59 - 05:32:01] new students welcome which was
[05:32:01 - 05:32:01] fantastic just to be in

[05:32:07 - 05:32:10] of those so to to
[05:32:10 - 05:32:14] see all these students there
[05:32:14 - 05:32:14] ready to start their um
[05:32:14 - 05:32:17] uh college careers at mount
[05:32:17 - 05:32:20] sack was really great and
[05:32:20 - 05:32:20] our staff was fantastic as
[05:32:20 - 05:32:21] well um introducing them to
[05:32:21 - 05:32:23] everything that our college has
[05:32:23 - 05:32:26] to offer i got to
[05:32:26 - 05:32:28] attend the asian-american drug abuse
[05:32:28 - 05:32:28] program gayla and it was
[05:32:31 - 05:32:31] actually held at la trade
[05:32:31 - 05:32:35] tech and the entire event
[05:32:35 - 05:32:35] was catered by their uh
[05:32:37 - 05:32:37] culinary arts facility and i
[05:32:37 - 05:32:39] got to say it was
[05:32:39 - 05:32:39] one of the the best
[05:32:39 - 05:32:41] banquet meals i have had
[05:32:41 - 05:32:43] i was really impressed it
[05:32:43 - 05:32:43] was a hawaiian luau style
[05:32:46 - 05:32:46] and they had kal a
[05:32:46 - 05:32:49] pork they had uh pokey
[05:32:49 - 05:32:49] they had all these things
[05:32:49 - 05:32:52] so i i have no
[05:32:52 - 05:32:54] doubt that our culinary facilities
[05:32:54 - 05:32:57] our culinary program can rise
[05:32:57 - 05:32:57] to that level and it's
[05:32:57 - 05:32:59] it's um good to see
[05:32:59 - 05:32:59] that the cafe 91 is
[05:32:59 - 05:33:03] coming back for um inerson
[05:33:03 - 05:33:06] dining and it's my goal
[05:33:06 - 05:33:06] that you know mount sack
[05:33:06 - 05:33:09] becomes and our our um
[05:33:09 - 05:33:11] our student center and the
[05:33:11 - 05:33:11] large space there becomes an
[05:33:11 - 05:33:14] area where people will consider
[05:33:14 - 05:33:16] for for big events like
[05:33:16 - 05:33:16] that as well i think
[05:33:16 - 05:33:17] that would be really great
[05:33:17 - 05:33:21] for the community if we
[05:33:21 - 05:33:21] um could offer that at
[05:33:21 - 05:33:23] some point i also attended
[05:33:23 - 05:33:25] the shili temple uh three
[05:33:25 - 05:33:25] acts of goodness opening ceremony
[05:33:28 - 05:33:28] this is their 10th year
[05:33:28 - 05:33:32] of providing this um this
[05:33:32 - 05:33:32] class and you know just
[05:33:32 - 05:33:34] in this and what they
[05:33:34 - 05:33:36] talk about you know three
[05:33:36 - 05:33:36] acts of goodness it's not
[05:33:36 - 05:33:39] a religious teaching it's it's
[05:33:39 - 05:33:44] something that's universal uh say
[05:33:44 - 05:33:44] good words do good acts
[05:33:44 - 05:33:46] and think good thoughts and
[05:33:46 - 05:33:48] i think given all the
[05:33:48 - 05:33:50] turmoil that we're experiencing in
[05:33:50 - 05:33:50] this country now it's just
[05:33:50 - 05:33:54] needed more than ever um
[05:33:54 - 05:33:57] that type of that type
[05:33:57 - 05:33:57] of outreach and it goes
[05:33:57 - 05:33:59] to the to the kids
[05:33:59 - 05:33:59] right and sometimes you see
[05:34:01 - 05:34:01] adults acting in ways that
[05:34:01 - 05:34:05] you would not want our
[05:34:05 - 05:34:05] students uh to emulate and
[05:34:05 - 05:34:08] it's very sad sometimes i
[05:34:08 - 05:34:09] i have my kids watch
[05:34:09 - 05:34:09] the news to tell them
[05:34:09 - 05:34:11] this this is exactly what
[05:34:11 - 05:34:11] you don't want to be
[05:34:11 - 05:34:13] you know i i use
[05:34:13 - 05:34:13] that as a teaching moment
[05:34:16 - 05:34:16] and it shouldn't be that
[05:34:16 - 05:34:18] way so that's it's sad
[05:34:18 - 05:34:18] that we're at that point
[05:34:18 - 05:34:19] i do want to mention
[05:34:19 - 05:34:21] the the sheila temple they've
[05:34:21 - 05:34:21] they mentioned to me that
[05:34:22 - 05:34:24] they would love to partner
[05:34:24 - 05:34:28] with mount sack and offer
[05:34:28 - 05:34:28] um meditation courses or or
[05:34:30 - 05:34:30] you know anything you know
[05:34:30 - 05:34:33] that we might think we
[05:34:33 - 05:34:33] can partner with them on
[05:34:33 - 05:34:35] so i will connect them
[05:34:35 - 05:34:37] with you dr garcia about
[05:34:37 - 05:34:37] ways that they could benefit
[05:34:37 - 05:34:40] our our student body or
[05:34:40 - 05:34:43] even our our faculty and
[05:34:43 - 05:34:43] staff that's my report thank

[05:35:19 - 05:35:19] me right away and was
[05:35:21 - 05:35:21] wondering what was going on

[05:35:31 - 05:35:31] it a few hundred students
[05:35:31 - 05:35:34] that were impacted uh were
[05:35:34 - 05:35:34] able to be uh relocated
[05:35:36 - 05:35:36] with and i think the
[05:35:36 - 05:35:40] city of la point was

[05:35:40 - 05:35:42] uh thankful for um everyone
[05:35:42 - 05:35:44] helping out with that and
[05:35:44 - 05:35:44] making sure that our our
[05:35:46 - 05:35:46] older adults you know have
[05:35:46 - 05:35:49] a place to take their
[05:35:49 - 05:35:49] their classes so just want
[05:35:52 - 05:35:52] to thank for that and
[05:35:52 - 05:35:52] then um uh i know
[05:35:55 - 05:35:55] this friday uh dr garcia
[05:35:55 - 05:35:58] and myself will be on
[05:35:58 - 05:35:58] a a panel in san
[05:35:58 - 05:36:00] diego for the california latino
[05:36:00 - 05:36:01] school boards the california latino
[05:36:01 - 05:36:06] school boards association association um
[05:36:06 - 05:36:06] talking about uh vision 2030
[05:36:06 - 05:36:09] and uh it's traditionally been
[05:36:09 - 05:36:11] um an association for k12
[05:36:11 - 05:36:14] latino school board members um
[05:36:14 - 05:36:14] and uh i've been working
[05:36:16 - 05:36:16] with some of the folks
[05:36:16 - 05:36:18] there i used to be
[05:36:18 - 05:36:18] on that board when i
[05:36:18 - 05:36:21] was in the k12 and
[05:36:21 - 05:36:21] we're really working to make
[05:36:21 - 05:36:23] it more of a k14
[05:36:27 - 05:36:27] um partnership so that um
[05:36:27 - 05:36:30] there's just u more communication
[05:36:30 - 05:36:33] and uh more resources and
[05:36:33 - 05:36:33] and more advocacy out there
[05:36:33 - 05:36:35] for uh k12s and and
[05:36:35 - 05:36:37] community colleges especially now with
[05:36:37 - 05:36:39] all the programs that are
[05:36:39 - 05:36:39] linking our high schoolers in
[05:36:42 - 05:36:42] terms of uh pathway program
[05:36:42 - 05:36:44] cte pathways and dual enrollment
[05:36:44 - 05:36:46] um so there's a much
[05:36:46 - 05:36:49] different perspective now than there
[05:36:49 - 05:36:49] was probably 1015 years ago
[05:36:49 - 05:36:52] so uh anyway looking to
[05:36:52 - 05:36:54] um continue to advocate for
[05:36:54 - 05:36:56] um our our incoming students
[05:36:56 - 05:36:56] you know as well as
[05:36:56 - 05:36:58] our own students and kind
[05:36:58 - 05:37:01] of share our knowledge with
[05:37:01 - 05:37:01] some of the k12 uh
[05:37:01 - 05:37:03] trustees throughout the state so
[05:37:03 - 05:37:05] um looking forward to to
[05:37:05 - 05:37:05] sharing that i think dr
[05:37:08 - 05:37:08] roman is also on uh

[05:38:27 - 05:38:29] me well the city invited
[05:38:29 - 05:38:29] us so i went over
[05:38:29 - 05:38:32] to the city staff how

[05:38:35 - 05:38:35] you get four tables here
[05:38:35 - 05:38:37] and who did that who
[05:38:37 - 05:38:37] invited jenny did it so
[05:38:37 - 05:38:40] i went up to jenny
[05:38:40 - 05:38:43] jenny what happened how did
[05:38:43 - 05:38:43] you get mount sack and
[05:38:43 - 05:38:46] she said well i i
[05:38:46 - 05:38:46] you know i called mount
[05:38:48 - 05:38:48] sack and they had me
[05:38:48 - 05:38:48] fill out a form i
[05:38:49 - 05:38:49] said a form so i
[05:38:49 - 05:38:52] went back to the mount
[05:38:52 - 05:38:52] sacks what where is this
[05:38:52 - 05:38:53] for so mount sacks what
[05:38:53 - 05:38:54] where is this for so
[05:38:54 - 05:38:57] evidently evidently you know and
[05:38:57 - 05:38:57] i'm you know to me
[05:38:59 - 05:38:59] jenny was a miracle worker
[05:38:59 - 05:39:01] i had to go tell
[05:39:01 - 05:39:01] her supervisor and the city
[05:39:04 - 05:39:04] manager you know jenny's a
[05:39:04 - 05:39:05] miracle worker i couldn't have
[05:39:05 - 05:39:07] and the city manager he
[05:39:07 - 05:39:07] said oh i thought you
[05:39:08 - 05:39:10] got them i said no
[05:39:10 - 05:39:13] that was jenny so i
[05:39:13 - 05:39:13] went back to the staff
[05:39:13 - 05:39:16] they told me that there's
[05:39:16 - 05:39:18] a form so evidently there's
[05:39:18 - 05:39:18] a new process and i'm
[05:39:18 - 05:39:21] so glad the city did
[05:39:21 - 05:39:21] this because i know if
[05:39:21 - 05:39:23] i would have done it
[05:39:23 - 05:39:23] i would have gone to
[05:39:26 - 05:39:26] dr garcia's office and then
[05:39:26 - 05:39:28] i talked to joe monroe
[05:39:28 - 05:39:28] and they would say oh
[05:39:28 - 05:39:29] yeah you could have a
[05:39:29 - 05:39:32] table and i would have
[05:39:32 - 05:39:32] got one table out there
[05:39:32 - 05:39:35] so what i learned from
[05:39:35 - 05:39:35] our staff is that there's
[05:39:35 - 05:39:41] a new process and there's
[05:39:41 - 05:39:41] a online form where if
[05:39:41 - 05:39:43] a community there's a community
[05:39:43 - 05:39:47] event you fill it out
[05:39:47 - 05:39:47] and they circulate the form
[05:39:49 - 05:39:49] among all the departments and
[05:39:49 - 05:39:53] they decide if they want
[05:39:53 - 05:39:59] to attend so um so
[05:39:59 - 05:39:59] let let all your you
[05:39:59 - 05:40:02] know community organizations know and
[05:40:02 - 05:40:04] like i said i'm so
[05:40:04 - 05:40:04] glad she did it instead
[05:40:04 - 05:40:05] of i because i couldn't
[05:40:05 - 05:40:08] have got four tables out
[05:40:08 - 05:40:08] there and i don't know

[05:43:24 - 05:43:24] coaches here but mount sack
[05:43:24 - 05:43:29] really been built from decades
[05:43:29 - 05:43:29] past so there's a lot
[05:43:29 - 05:43:31] of people that have contributed
[05:43:31 - 05:43:33] to really create a great
[05:43:33 - 05:43:37] tradition and over the years
[05:43:37 - 05:43:37] it's just improved adding the
[05:43:42 - 05:43:42] academic support uh uh for
[05:43:42 - 05:43:46] athletes just is unique uh
[05:43:46 - 05:43:46] uh you know among the
[05:43:48 - 05:43:48] community colleges in the state
[05:43:48 - 05:43:51] it's a very strong program
[05:43:51 - 05:43:54] i think we're not only
[05:43:54 - 05:43:54] having great athletes but also
[05:43:58 - 05:43:58] um uh scholars as well
[05:43:58 - 05:44:00] so that's a great thing
[05:44:00 - 05:44:00] and it's great to see
[05:44:00 - 05:44:02] the new energy here with
[05:44:02 - 05:44:05] the with the newly hired
[05:44:05 - 05:44:05] faculty and uh looking forward

[05:45:14 - 05:45:15] cool coup that we managed
[05:45:15 - 05:45:18] to get the chancellor to
[05:45:18 - 05:45:18] be here she was wonderful
[05:45:20 - 05:45:20] in the presentation and and

[05:46:44 - 05:46:47] it was a close call
[05:46:47 - 05:46:49] because mount san diego mesa
[05:46:49 - 05:46:49] college is a very good
[05:46:49 - 05:46:52] football team but we did
[05:46:52 - 05:46:53] pull it out that's it

[05:47:02 - 05:47:02] story to tell because i

[05:51:15 - 05:51:19] sack want to start by
[05:51:19 - 05:51:24] sharing exciting news uh and
[05:51:24 - 05:51:24] thanking bp uh dominguez um
[05:51:24 - 05:51:30] we sold 250 million in
[05:51:30 - 05:51:34] bonds yesterday and to see
[05:51:34 - 05:51:34] that happen in real time
[05:51:34 - 05:51:37] uh was amazing this is
[05:51:37 - 05:51:42] the barclays uh building in
[05:51:42 - 05:51:42] new york city and um
[05:51:42 - 05:51:45] i want to share that
[05:51:45 - 05:51:47] we had 65 unique investors
[05:51:47 - 05:51:50] interested in purchasing the bonds
[05:51:50 - 05:51:50] for mount sack uh our
[05:51:50 - 05:51:54] credit credit rating is very
[05:51:54 - 05:51:56] important um and obviously it
[05:51:56 - 05:51:56] is during this process that
[05:52:01 - 05:52:01] it is highlighted the most
[05:52:01 - 05:52:05] um from because we had
[05:52:05 - 05:52:06] that uh amount of interest
[05:52:06 - 05:52:09] from different investors and frankly
[05:52:09 - 05:52:09] like um there was a
[05:52:09 - 05:52:12] lot more interest in purchasing
[05:52:12 - 05:52:15] than than what we had
[05:52:15 - 05:52:15] available to sell what happened
[05:52:19 - 05:52:19] between pre-pricing and when we
[05:52:19 - 05:52:22] um approved the final pricing
[05:52:22 - 05:52:25] was a reduction of 10
[05:52:25 - 05:52:26] to 20 basis points in
[05:52:29 - 05:52:29] absolute yield which resulted in
[05:52:29 - 05:52:32] 9 million in savings to
[05:52:32 - 05:52:36] our taxpayers so it is
[05:52:36 - 05:52:36] evident that spending the time
[05:52:42 - 05:52:42] and working very closely with
[05:52:42 - 05:52:46] um our team the team
[05:52:46 - 05:52:49] that obviously our lead um
[05:52:49 - 05:52:49] which is barclays and including
[05:52:49 - 05:52:54] the other um team members
[05:52:54 - 05:52:59] from the other um companies
[05:52:59 - 05:52:59] resulted in us coming to
[05:52:59 - 05:53:03] um the final approval of
[05:53:03 - 05:53:05] those uh rate and ultimately
[05:53:05 - 05:53:05] what will result in savings
[05:53:09 - 05:53:09] to the community on september
[05:53:09 - 05:53:14] 25th barclays will transfer 250
[05:53:14 - 05:53:19] million to the county of
