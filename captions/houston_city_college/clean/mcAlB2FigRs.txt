[01:26:10 - 01:26:13] through education now i would
[01:26:13 - 01:26:16] like to invite dr butch
[01:26:16 - 01:26:16] herod and kathy to the
[01:26:16 - 01:26:19] podium for remarks for remarks
[01:26:39 - 01:26:45] hi i want to read
[01:26:45 - 01:26:45] this to get this right
[01:26:47 - 01:26:47] so madame chair members of
[01:26:47 - 01:26:49] the hcc board madame chancellor
[01:26:49 - 01:26:52] colleagues and guests kathy asked
[01:26:52 - 01:26:54] that i speak on behalf
[01:26:54 - 01:26:54] of both of us this
[01:26:54 - 01:26:55] afternoon and by the way
[01:26:55 - 01:26:55] she always sits in the
[01:26:55 - 01:26:57] back she works in the
[01:26:57 - 01:26:57] it division and i have
[01:26:59 - 01:26:59] a quick comment about that
[01:26:59 - 01:27:01] in a minute but uh
[01:27:01 - 01:27:01] no it's a good thing
[01:27:01 - 01:27:04] it's not about the network
[01:27:05 - 01:27:05] in establishing this scholarship it
[01:27:06 - 01:27:08] is our intention that these
[01:27:08 - 01:27:11] funds be used for students
[01:27:11 - 01:27:13] from the central college area
[01:27:13 - 01:27:13] this is not because it
[01:27:13 - 01:27:15] is my current college but
[01:27:15 - 01:27:18] because these zip codes represent
[01:27:18 - 01:27:20] some of the most economically
[01:27:20 - 01:27:22] disadvantaged communities in greater houston
[01:27:24 - 01:27:24] there are people in these
[01:27:24 - 01:27:26] communities that see no hope
[01:27:26 - 01:27:29] for themselves to escape their
[01:27:29 - 01:27:31] economic circumstances we must provide
[01:27:31 - 01:27:31] that hope if things are
[01:27:33 - 01:27:35] to change intergenerational poverty is
[01:27:35 - 01:27:37] a tragedy and we cannot
[01:27:37 - 01:27:40] continue to waste our precious
[01:27:40 - 01:27:40] human capital we hope that
[01:27:40 - 01:27:42] in some small manner that
[01:27:42 - 01:27:44] this scholarship can help to
[01:27:44 - 01:27:46] change the trajectory of some
[01:27:46 - 01:27:46] of their lives and now
[01:27:46 - 01:27:49] just a quick comment i
[01:27:49 - 01:27:52] we can never express our
[01:27:52 - 01:27:52] gratitude enough for all that

[01:35:53 - 01:36:00] you presidents thank you madam
[01:36:00 - 01:36:03] chair uh good afternoon colleagues
[01:36:03 - 01:36:06] and everyone in attendance so
[01:36:06 - 01:36:06] the month of the months
[01:36:09 - 01:36:09] of july and august were
[01:36:09 - 01:36:12] very uh active within district
[01:36:12 - 01:36:15] 4 particularly with coleman college
[01:36:15 - 01:36:15] uh we had a slew
[01:36:15 - 01:36:18] of pinning ceremonies too numerous
[01:36:18 - 01:36:22] to count um two of
[01:36:22 - 01:36:23] them in particular stick out
[01:36:23 - 01:36:23] i was a participant with
[01:36:24 - 01:36:27] the dental assistant pinning ceremony
[01:36:29 - 01:36:29] as well as the radiography
[01:36:29 - 01:36:30] pinning as well as the
[01:36:30 - 01:36:34] radiography pinning ceremony ceremony these
[01:36:34 - 01:36:37] pinning ceremonies uh acknowledge a
[01:36:37 - 01:36:37] recognition of their the completion
[01:36:37 - 01:36:39] of the education journey for
[01:36:39 - 01:36:42] these professionals uh who have
[01:36:42 - 01:36:44] earned their certification at the
[01:36:44 - 01:36:46] time and i would tell
[01:36:46 - 01:36:49] you that um that's where
[01:36:49 - 01:36:49] the real action is when
[01:36:51 - 01:36:51] you talk about coleman college
[01:36:51 - 01:36:54] that's where you really see
[01:36:54 - 01:36:59] the meaningfulness of what hcc
[01:36:59 - 01:36:59] does for those students the
[01:37:01 - 01:37:01] ripple effect it has on
[01:37:01 - 01:37:06] their families the level of
[01:37:06 - 01:37:06] excitement that you see um
[01:37:08 - 01:37:08] for individuals who are earning
[01:37:10 - 01:37:10] certificates so i think it's
[01:37:10 - 01:37:11] very meaningful and i thought
[01:37:11 - 01:37:13] it'd be it's only appropriate
[01:37:13 - 01:37:14] to bring that to colleagues
[01:37:14 - 01:37:14] that a lot of times
[01:37:14 - 01:37:16] these students get pinned they
[01:37:16 - 01:37:19] don't show up in december
[01:37:19 - 01:37:21] because they're that was their
[01:37:21 - 01:37:21] moment that was when the
[01:37:21 - 01:37:23] whole family showed up and
[01:37:23 - 01:37:23] i can i mean i'm
[01:37:25 - 01:37:25] not embellishing there's at least
[01:37:25 - 01:37:28] 10 attendees per graduate at
[01:37:28 - 01:37:30] these ceremonies so it's very
[01:37:30 - 01:37:32] special along those same lines
[01:37:32 - 01:37:36] uh the radiography pinning ceremony
[01:37:36 - 01:37:39] uh professor patricia gal who
[01:37:39 - 01:37:39] was a long-term almost 40year
[01:37:41 - 01:37:41] faculty member adjunct of houston
[01:37:44 - 01:37:44] community college uh was presented
[01:37:44 - 01:37:46] with the legacy award by
[01:37:46 - 01:37:49] the radiology faculty so i
[01:37:49 - 01:37:52] think her contributions for nearly
[01:37:52 - 01:37:52] four decades uh were not
[01:37:52 - 01:37:54] only worthy of recognition at
[01:37:54 - 01:37:57] that event but is worthy
[01:37:57 - 01:37:58] of recognition from us all
[01:38:00 - 01:38:00] miss gal unfortunately could not
[01:38:00 - 01:38:02] attend this evening uh but
[01:38:02 - 01:38:04] certainly want to make sure
[01:38:04 - 01:38:04] that dr harrison please relay
[01:38:07 - 01:38:07] that message to her and
[01:38:07 - 01:38:09] colleagues who hear about this
[01:38:09 - 01:38:11] we really appreciate her contribution
[01:38:11 - 01:38:11] as well as those who
[01:38:14 - 01:38:14] continue to contribute to this
[01:38:14 - 01:38:14] fantastic continue to contribute to
[01:38:15 - 01:38:17] this fantastic institution institution we
[01:38:17 - 01:38:17] held our community meeting as
[01:38:17 - 01:38:20] well at coleman college which
[01:38:20 - 01:38:23] uh was a fantastic occasion
[01:38:23 - 01:38:23] uh we started we got
[01:38:23 - 01:38:25] to solicit some input i
[01:38:25 - 01:38:27] might have forcefully induced people
[01:38:27 - 01:38:30] to start sending comments uh
[01:38:30 - 01:38:30] our way i see mr
[01:38:34 - 01:38:34] miguel there so um that
[01:38:34 - 01:38:37] was great the last thing
[01:38:37 - 01:38:40] i'll say is um this
[01:38:40 - 01:38:40] month marks the 20th anniversary
[01:38:40 - 01:38:44] of hurricane katrina dr harrison
[01:38:44 - 01:38:44] i know you have ties
[01:38:44 - 01:38:47] to new orleans uh my
[01:38:47 - 01:38:50] alma university of houston downtown
[01:38:50 - 01:38:50] will be hosting um a
[01:38:55 - 01:38:55] commemoration of this next thursday
[01:38:55 - 01:38:57] um and i think it's
[01:38:57 - 01:38:57] worthy of all of us
[01:38:57 - 01:38:59] to reflect not just what
[01:38:59 - 01:39:01] it meant to those folks
[01:39:01 - 01:39:01] uh our neighbors to the
[01:39:01 - 01:39:03] east but what it meant
[01:39:03 - 01:39:03] to this community and what
[01:39:06 - 01:39:06] this community did to embrace
[01:39:06 - 01:39:08] those who were affected by
[01:39:08 - 01:39:18] that devastation so wanted to
[01:39:18 - 01:39:20] make three quick recognitions uh
[01:39:20 - 01:39:20] the first one very much
[01:39:20 - 01:39:21] following a theme wanted to
[01:39:21 - 01:39:23] thank uh dr webster and
[01:39:23 - 01:39:23] the staff at southwest college
[01:39:23 - 01:39:25] for the community partnership event
[01:39:25 - 01:39:27] as well not only the
[01:39:27 - 01:39:27] the one formally called a
[01:39:29 - 01:39:29] community partnership event but also
[01:39:31 - 01:39:31] the july event the media
[01:39:31 - 01:39:33] appreciation launch both were hugely
[01:39:33 - 01:39:35] impactful also had a similar
[01:39:35 - 01:39:35] experience as dr lent and
[01:39:36 - 01:39:36] gary that folks were really
[01:39:36 - 01:39:38] so excited in the moment
[01:39:38 - 01:39:38] that they wanted to set
[01:39:38 - 01:39:40] up apprenticeships and internships with
[01:39:42 - 01:39:42] their businesses so really cool
[01:39:42 - 01:39:44] to see how well we
[01:39:44 - 01:39:46] do community engagement not only
[01:39:46 - 01:39:46] from the response that we
[01:39:46 - 01:39:48] get in forums like that
[01:39:48 - 01:39:48] but also some of the
[01:39:49 - 01:39:49] eyepopping enrollment numbers i don't
[01:39:51 - 01:39:51] want to steal the chancellor's
[01:39:51 - 01:39:53] uh thunder here but some
[01:39:53 - 01:39:54] of the eyepopping enrollment numbers
[01:39:54 - 01:39:56] that we're seeing at at
[01:39:56 - 01:39:56] westloop college and the southwest
[01:39:58 - 01:39:58] system in general just amazing
[01:39:58 - 01:39:59] and it's a testament to
[01:39:59 - 01:40:01] how much we're really reaching
[01:40:01 - 01:40:02] into the community successfully and
[01:40:02 - 01:40:02] and letting people know the
[01:40:04 - 01:40:04] offerings that that we've got
[01:40:04 - 01:40:06] to improve their lives and
[01:40:06 - 01:40:06] help them level up um
[01:40:08 - 01:40:08] second recognition want to specifically
[01:40:11 - 01:40:11] recognize uh dr boutehanoloma and
[01:40:11 - 01:40:14] dr smith we had a
[01:40:14 - 01:40:19] more hectic than expected summer
[01:40:19 - 01:40:19] with uh sp37 and um
[01:40:19 - 01:40:21] many many people uh including
[01:40:21 - 01:40:24] uh the full uh sp37
[01:40:24 - 01:40:24] tax task force had a
[01:40:24 - 01:40:25] lot to do with the
[01:40:25 - 01:40:25] votes that we're going to
[01:40:25 - 01:40:27] take tonight um but wanted
[01:40:27 - 01:40:29] to specifically recognize y'all that
[01:40:29 - 01:40:32] y'all brought focus and clarity
[01:40:32 - 01:40:32] to that discussion i don't
[01:40:33 - 01:40:33] think we would have reached
[01:40:33 - 01:40:35] as good of an outcome
[01:40:35 - 01:40:35] as we did without your
[01:40:36 - 01:40:36] persistence and your focus and
[01:40:36 - 01:40:37] your hard work especially when
[01:40:37 - 01:40:39] you thought you were going
[01:40:39 - 01:40:39] to be on vacation so
[01:40:39 - 01:40:41] uh just a big thank
[01:40:41 - 01:40:41] you for that i think
[01:40:43 - 01:40:43] this institution is much stronger
[01:40:43 - 01:40:44] off because of the sacrifices
[01:40:44 - 01:40:46] that y'all made over the
[01:40:46 - 01:40:46] last couple of months and
[01:40:49 - 01:40:49] then finally wanted to recognize
[01:40:49 - 01:40:50] our early college high schools
[01:40:50 - 01:40:52] i don't know if y'all
[01:40:52 - 01:40:52] saw the us news and
[01:40:52 - 01:40:55] world report uh list of
[01:40:55 - 01:40:57] top 100 public high schools

[01:42:22 - 01:42:22] the principal at wheatley high
[01:42:25 - 01:42:25] school as well as forest

[01:42:42 - 01:42:44] in regards to district 2
[01:42:44 - 01:42:44] as you can tell my
[01:42:44 - 01:42:45] voice may be a little
[01:42:45 - 01:42:47] bit different but that's because
[01:42:47 - 01:42:47] i've been talking a lot
[01:42:49 - 01:42:49] more than what i'm probably
[01:42:49 - 01:42:52] accustomed to but all of
[01:42:52 - 01:42:54] it is great information and
[01:42:54 - 01:42:54] as i always like to
[01:42:54 - 01:42:55] say you know we are
[01:42:55 - 01:42:55] getting it right and we
[01:42:55 - 01:42:57] are moving forward at houston
[01:42:57 - 01:42:59] city college and again it's
[01:42:59 - 01:43:01] a pleasure and a privilege
[01:43:01 - 01:43:07] to work alongside my trusty
[01:43:07 - 01:43:10] wilson uh madam chair i'll
[01:43:10 - 01:43:10] seed my time to the
[01:43:12 - 01:43:12] trustee to my right because
[01:43:12 - 01:43:17] i'm sure she i just
[01:43:17 - 01:43:20] realized it was that's why
[01:43:20 - 01:43:23] we're friends um i want
[01:43:23 - 01:43:23] to say thank you to
[01:43:23 - 01:43:26] to uh president herod and
[01:43:26 - 01:43:28] and uh vice president bmer
[01:43:28 - 01:43:28] it is a very it
[01:43:28 - 01:43:32] is very much a challenge
[01:43:32 - 01:43:34] when you are enrolling and
[01:43:34 - 01:43:37] increasing enrollment for south campus
[01:43:37 - 01:43:37] we have worked hard from
[01:43:37 - 01:43:39] 2018 to get that enrollment
[01:43:39 - 01:43:41] above a thousand students so
[01:43:41 - 01:43:41] i want to say thank
[01:43:41 - 01:43:44] you because we had 11
[01:43:44 - 01:43:47] health wellness and backpack drives
[01:43:47 - 01:43:51] in district 9 region from
[01:43:51 - 01:43:51] july 19th to now and

[01:44:02 - 01:44:05] my other president dr mike
[01:44:05 - 01:44:08] webster because the southwest side
[01:44:08 - 01:44:08] of of my district is
[01:44:10 - 01:44:10] very much different from the
[01:44:10 - 01:44:12] east side of my district
[01:44:12 - 01:44:12] he has to deal with
[01:44:12 - 01:44:14] a number of international organizations
[01:44:17 - 01:44:17] and he has fared very
[01:44:17 - 01:44:20] very well in terms of
[01:44:20 - 01:44:20] us reestablishing us with early
[01:44:22 - 01:44:22] college high schools and dual
[01:44:22 - 01:44:26] credit because those areas really
[01:44:26 - 01:44:28] did need that solid footing
[01:44:28 - 01:44:28] for dual credit and early
[01:44:29 - 01:44:29] college high school so i
[01:44:29 - 01:44:32] want to thank you for
[01:44:32 - 01:44:32] that i also want to
[01:44:32 - 01:44:35] say that it has been
[01:44:35 - 01:44:35] an honor to work with
[01:44:35 - 01:44:38] both of these presidents because
[01:44:38 - 01:44:41] they have done extraordinary work
[01:44:41 - 01:44:44] with their teams i want
[01:44:44 - 01:44:44] to say that both uh
[01:44:44 - 01:44:47] colleges have an extraordinary presence
[01:44:47 - 01:44:50] in social media and that
[01:44:50 - 01:44:50] presence has brought us a
[01:44:52 - 01:44:52] number of new students and
[01:44:52 - 01:44:55] i want to thank the
[01:44:55 - 01:44:56] chancellor for uh for her
[01:44:58 - 01:44:58] presentation and she also had
[01:44:58 - 01:45:00] a chance to see that

[01:45:07 - 01:45:10] program they are very excited
[01:45:10 - 01:45:13] and i'm thankful that they
[01:45:13 - 01:45:13] are there um and i
[01:45:13 - 01:45:17] want to also add that

[01:45:17 - 01:45:21] left he is always ready
[01:45:21 - 01:45:24] to increase enrollment and presence
[01:45:24 - 01:45:27] of houston city college in
[01:45:27 - 01:45:27] katie because i had one
[01:45:27 - 01:45:30] of his constituents to call
[01:45:30 - 01:45:32] and ask me for help
[01:45:32 - 01:45:32] and so it was a
[01:45:32 - 01:45:34] blessing to send that constituent
[01:45:34 - 01:45:34] back to get the answers

[02:11:56 - 02:11:56] and uh i'd like to
[02:11:56 - 02:11:58] thank the chancellor for her
[02:11:58 - 02:12:01] leadership and i'd like to
[02:12:01 - 02:12:01] thank uh our our current
[02:12:01 - 02:12:04] chair for her leadership and
[02:12:04 - 02:12:07] those numbers increasing enrollment uh
[02:12:07 - 02:12:10] make me feel encouraged invigorated
[02:12:10 - 02:12:13] and uh positive about the
[02:12:13 - 02:12:13] future but i'd also would
[02:12:13 - 02:12:17] be remiss in not thanking
[02:12:17 - 02:12:20] the u previous board chair
[02:12:20 - 02:12:23] for the preliminary work that
[02:12:23 - 02:12:23] she did the last couple
[02:12:23 - 02:12:25] of years to build a
[02:12:25 - 02:12:25] foundation to make all this
[02:12:28 - 02:12:28] happen this just didn't happen
[02:12:28 - 02:12:30] today at this board meeting
[02:12:30 - 02:12:35] it happened over years with
[02:12:35 - 02:12:35] a lot of hard work
[02:12:35 - 02:12:39] and u i thank you
[02:12:39 - 02:12:39] uh trustee laredo and trustee
[02:13:09 - 02:13:09] the chair has insisted i
[02:13:09 - 02:13:13] add some comments so i
[02:13:13 - 02:13:13] i'll just say you know
[02:13:20 - 02:13:20] it i intentionally did not
[02:13:20 - 02:13:22] mention it during the district
[02:13:22 - 02:13:23] report because i thought it
[02:13:23 - 02:13:26] was befitting that you presented
[02:13:26 - 02:13:26] it um it's a culmination
[02:13:28 - 02:13:28] chancellor you might recall i
[02:13:28 - 02:13:31] had a meeting with you
[02:13:31 - 02:13:34] in december of 2023 uh
[02:13:34 - 02:13:34] this is before i've been
[02:13:34 - 02:13:37] sworn into this board and
[02:13:37 - 02:13:41] i indicated something i'd become
[02:13:41 - 02:13:44] aware of and so it's
[02:13:44 - 02:13:44] a year and a half
[02:13:44 - 02:13:47] or more uh in the
[02:13:47 - 02:13:47] making you know it was
[02:13:47 - 02:13:51] not a fun position to
[02:13:51 - 02:13:54] find this institution in a
[02:13:54 - 02:13:54] position where uh one of
[02:13:54 - 02:13:54] his flagship a position where
[02:13:55 - 02:13:56] uh one of his flagship
[02:13:56 - 02:13:59] programs programs uh had you
[02:13:59 - 02:14:01] know summarily been taken away
[02:14:03 - 02:14:03] and but it was something
[02:14:03 - 02:14:06] that we needed to confront
[02:14:06 - 02:14:06] head on it was important
[02:14:09 - 02:14:09] that we didn't seek to
[02:14:09 - 02:14:11] obfuscate the fact and chancellor
[02:14:11 - 02:14:15] i want to thank you
[02:14:15 - 02:14:15] for uh rallying the team
[02:14:15 - 02:14:18] and being able to come
[02:14:18 - 02:14:18] up with a succinct message
[02:14:22 - 02:14:22] hey this happened we un
[02:14:22 - 02:14:24] we own it we have
[02:14:24 - 02:14:24] a plan we're going to
[02:14:24 - 02:14:27] get this back and we
[02:14:27 - 02:14:31] started that process early in
[02:14:31 - 02:14:31] 2024 he brought dr harrison
[02:14:31 - 02:14:33] on and so the story
[02:14:33 - 02:14:33] goes so there was a
[02:14:33 - 02:14:35] lot that this took i
[02:14:35 - 02:14:38] want to you know thank
[02:14:38 - 02:14:38] the entirety of the team
[02:14:38 - 02:14:41] uh i know what it's
[02:14:41 - 02:14:41] taken and it it it's
[02:14:41 - 02:14:43] not a fun i i
[02:14:43 - 02:14:43] will admit it was not
[02:14:43 - 02:14:46] a fun position to be
[02:14:46 - 02:14:46] in to to to learn
[02:14:46 - 02:14:48] of that and i know
[02:14:48 - 02:14:50] had several conversations trusty wilson
[02:14:50 - 02:14:50] was very interested in the
[02:14:52 - 02:14:52] matter so i mean i
[02:14:52 - 02:14:55] couldn't be more proud of
[02:14:55 - 02:14:55] where we are and i
[02:14:55 - 02:14:57] think the promise that it
[02:14:57 - 02:14:57] holds you know we made
[02:15:00 - 02:15:00] this promise we've kept this
[02:15:00 - 02:15:02] promise and so now it's
[02:15:02 - 02:15:05] our opportunity to deliver on
[02:15:05 - 02:15:05] the promise for those future
[02:15:07 - 02:15:07] students and for those students
[02:15:07 - 02:15:09] who stuck it through we
[02:15:09 - 02:15:12] had to teach students through
[02:15:12 - 02:15:14] uh the program despite u
[02:15:14 - 02:15:16] this accreditation being stripped away
[02:15:16 - 02:15:16] so it's been a long

[02:40:10 - 02:40:10] madam chancellor and trustees so
[02:40:12 - 02:40:12] sp is an institutional effectiveness
[02:40:13 - 02:40:14] platform that helps colleges and
[02:40:15 - 02:40:18] universities streamline assessment and accreditation
[02:40:18 - 02:40:20] processes it enables us to
[02:40:20 - 02:40:20] align st academic outcomes with
[02:40:21 - 02:40:23] accreditation standards centralize documentation and
[02:40:23 - 02:40:26] drive data informed decisionm across
[02:40:26 - 02:40:29] the institution this purchase which
[02:40:29 - 02:40:29] went through an rfp will
[02:40:31 - 02:40:31] replace two existing software packages
[02:40:33 - 02:40:33] at a substantial cost savings
[02:40:34 - 02:40:34] implementation of this platform will
[02:40:36 - 02:40:36] support both institutional sac coc
[02:40:38 - 02:40:41] accreditation and third party accreditations
[02:40:41 - 02:40:41] so at this time i
[02:40:41 - 02:40:43] will take any questions about
[02:40:43 - 02:40:43] its purpose and take any
[02:40:44 - 02:40:45] questions about its purpose and
[02:40:45 - 02:40:46] utility utility utility trust trust
[02:40:47 - 02:40:48] yes yes sir trust she
[02:40:49 - 02:40:49] hi uh so you mentioned
[02:40:49 - 02:40:51] a substantial cost savings what
[02:40:51 - 02:40:51] what do you mean by
[02:40:53 - 02:40:53] that like how much are
[02:40:53 - 02:40:55] you talking over time the
[02:40:55 - 02:40:55] current annual cost for the
[02:40:57 - 02:40:57] platform it is replacing or
[02:40:57 - 02:40:59] would replace if approved is
[02:40:59 - 02:41:01] about 99k the cost of
[02:41:01 - 02:41:01] this platform on a yearly
[02:41:01 - 02:41:04] basis is around 31k okay
[02:41:04 - 02:41:04] that makes substantial okay that
[02:41:04 - 02:41:06] makes substantial yes yes um
[02:41:06 - 02:41:06] so second question um you
[02:41:06 - 02:41:08] know we have a lot
[02:41:08 - 02:41:09] of software implementations that are
[02:41:09 - 02:41:11] in flight in particular the
[02:41:11 - 02:41:13] website right and fingers crossed
[02:41:13 - 02:41:15] the associated app that i
[02:41:15 - 02:41:15] heard dr adil mention very
[02:41:15 - 02:41:17] favorably at the westloop town
[02:41:17 - 02:41:19] hall so hopefully that'll happen
[02:41:19 - 02:41:19] after years of dr vender
[02:41:21 - 02:41:21] stalworth uh reminding us how
[02:41:21 - 02:41:22] important that would be uh
[02:41:22 - 02:41:22] just want to make sure
[02:41:25 - 02:41:25] that this implementation does not
[02:41:25 - 02:41:27] use the same resources or
[02:41:27 - 02:41:29] put the timelines of the
[02:41:29 - 02:41:29] website the app or any
[02:41:29 - 02:41:30] of the other critical software
[02:41:30 - 02:41:33] implementations at risk it should
[02:41:33 - 02:41:35] not there's actually uh a
[02:41:35 - 02:41:38] substantial amount of supplementary support
[02:41:38 - 02:41:38] from the platform itself so
[02:41:40 - 02:41:40] essentially what it does is
[02:41:40 - 02:41:43] it provides an access point
[02:41:43 - 02:41:43] for us to utilize the
[02:41:45 - 02:41:45] functionality so it is a
[02:41:45 - 02:41:47] it is an a cloud-based
[02:41:47 - 02:41:47] system and so the way
[02:41:47 - 02:41:50] it is used we enter
[02:41:50 - 02:41:50] data into the system and
[02:41:52 - 02:41:52] it helps us to document
[02:41:52 - 02:41:52] and accumulate it helps us
[02:41:52 - 02:41:52] to document and accumulate data
[02:41:52 - 02:41:58] data there's no further questions
[02:41:58 - 02:42:00] and ready to take a
[02:42:00 - 02:42:08] vote that's right yes we
[02:42:08 - 02:42:09] discussed that that's right yes
[02:42:09 - 02:42:10] we discussed that absolutely absolutely
[02:42:11 - 02:42:12] houston city college city college
[02:42:12 - 02:42:17] city college absolutely absolutely we're
[02:42:17 - 02:42:17] going to be changing it

[02:42:37 - 02:42:39] concluded the motion passed unanimously

[02:43:56 - 02:43:57] no inter internships were involved
[02:43:57 - 02:43:57] here it's one of the
[02:43:57 - 02:44:01] standards we use when we

[02:44:04 - 02:44:04] a rental services company the
[02:44:06 - 02:44:08] college previously obtained av production

[02:44:14 - 02:44:17] 5-year contract is needed to
[02:44:17 - 02:44:19] ensure consistent quality improve planning
[02:44:19 - 02:44:21] and secure a trusted vendor
[02:44:21 - 02:44:22] this approach also ensures compliance
[02:44:22 - 02:44:23] with procurement compliance with procurement
[02:44:24 - 02:44:25] requirements requirements it's again it's
[02:44:25 - 02:44:30] a two-year contract and per
[02:44:30 - 02:44:35] year madam chair can you

[02:44:35 - 02:44:36] explain this internship requirement requirement
[02:44:38 - 02:44:38] well it's what it's something
[02:44:38 - 02:44:39] that i i kind of
[02:44:39 - 02:44:39] make sure that we ask
[02:44:39 - 02:44:41] every vendor just to see
[02:44:41 - 02:44:42] if there's an opportunity to
[02:44:42 - 02:44:45] get students involved in an
[02:44:45 - 02:44:45] internship with their company it's
[02:44:48 - 02:44:48] just a standard question we
[02:44:48 - 02:44:49] ask we look for internship
[02:44:49 - 02:44:53] opportunities for our students as
[02:44:53 - 02:44:56] part of procurement and they
[02:44:56 - 02:44:56] get a bump if they
[02:44:56 - 02:44:56] give us an and they
[02:44:56 - 02:44:56] get a bump if they
[02:44:56 - 02:44:56] give us an internship internship
[02:44:58 - 02:44:58] they don't get anything it's
[02:44:58 - 02:44:59] just something that we look
[02:44:59 - 02:45:01] for as a benefit for
[02:45:01 - 02:45:02] the students but it's something
[02:45:02 - 02:45:03] we consider when we make
[02:45:03 - 02:45:05] a decision um i don't
[02:45:05 - 02:45:05] know i think we just
[02:45:05 - 02:45:07] make sure we raise the
[02:45:07 - 02:45:07] issue just to see if
[02:45:09 - 02:45:10] that's a possibility okay i
[02:45:10 - 02:45:10] just want to make sure
[02:45:10 - 02:45:12] legal looks at this i
[02:45:12 - 02:45:12] have i have a huge
[02:45:14 - 02:45:14] issue with somebody giving us
[02:45:14 - 02:45:16] something in exchange for a
[02:45:16 - 02:45:16] contract and and i i
[02:45:19 - 02:45:19] i that i i know
[02:45:19 - 02:45:19] i know what we're doing
[02:45:21 - 02:45:21] but i have a huge
[02:45:21 - 02:45:21] concern about that but i
[02:45:21 - 02:45:21] have a huge concern about
[02:45:21 - 02:45:24] that okay okay okay thank
[02:45:24 - 02:45:28] you any other questions other
[02:45:28 - 02:45:30] trustes questions trusty she um
[02:45:30 - 02:45:30] is this contract is it
[02:45:30 - 02:45:32] a not to exceed like
[02:45:32 - 02:45:32] a lot of the other
[02:45:33 - 02:45:33] longerterm contracts that we have
[02:45:33 - 02:45:35] or is this a lump
[02:45:35 - 02:45:35] sum by year and i
[02:45:35 - 02:45:37] ask because normally i'm trying
[02:45:37 - 02:45:39] to refer more work to
[02:45:39 - 02:45:39] the ai department but in
[02:45:40 - 02:45:40] this case we also have
[02:45:40 - 02:45:42] an amazing audiovisisual department through
[02:45:42 - 02:45:44] hcctv and if we find
[02:45:44 - 02:45:46] ourselves in a position where
[02:45:46 - 02:45:46] we would trust our internal
[02:45:47 - 02:45:47] department to do some of
[02:45:47 - 02:45:48] this work just wanted to
[02:45:48 - 02:45:48] make sure that we weren't
[02:45:50 - 02:45:50] locked into using an outside
[02:45:50 - 02:45:52] vendor if we ever see
[02:45:52 - 02:45:54] that as an opportunity i'm
[02:45:54 - 02:45:54] not certain i can check
[02:45:54 - 02:45:54] that for i'm not certain
[02:45:54 - 02:45:54] i can check that for
[02:45:54 - 02:45:57] you you okay thanks well
[02:45:57 - 02:45:57] i i i would like
[02:45:57 - 02:45:59] to respond madam chair that's
[02:45:59 - 02:45:59] one of the questions that
[02:46:01 - 02:46:01] we asked members of our
[02:46:01 - 02:46:03] team and they indicated that
[02:46:03 - 02:46:03] they simply do not have
[02:46:05 - 02:46:05] the additional trained talent that
[02:46:05 - 02:46:09] are part of the personnel
[02:46:09 - 02:46:09] in hctv to be able
[02:46:10 - 02:46:10] to manage all of the
[02:46:10 - 02:46:13] production that would be required
[02:46:13 - 02:46:13] so but that was of
[02:46:14 - 02:46:14] was of concern because when
[02:46:14 - 02:46:16] we looked at the dollar
[02:46:16 - 02:46:16] amount we said that it
[02:46:16 - 02:46:18] is conceivable that what we
[02:46:18 - 02:46:20] are paying that we would
[02:46:20 - 02:46:20] be able to hire staff
[02:46:20 - 02:46:22] who would be on board
[02:46:22 - 02:46:22] with us to be able
[02:46:22 - 02:46:25] to deliver these services yes
[02:46:27 - 02:46:28] you're welcome if there's no
[02:46:28 - 02:46:32] further questions and we're ready
[02:46:32 - 02:46:32] to vote on item c
[02:46:32 - 02:46:45] audio the the voting has
[02:46:45 - 02:46:47] concluded the motion passed with

[02:49:01 - 02:49:01] you madam chair members of
[02:49:01 - 02:49:03] the board this item is
[02:49:03 - 02:49:05] a recommendation for your consideration
[02:49:05 - 02:49:07] to authorize the chancellor to
[02:49:07 - 02:49:09] execute a contract with separation
[02:49:09 - 02:49:11] system consultants incorporated to provide
[02:49:11 - 02:49:13] professional environmental consulting services in
[02:49:18 - 02:49:18] support of project number rfq25-34
[02:49:20 - 02:49:20] of facilities environmental health and
[02:49:21 - 02:49:21] safety department and with your
[02:49:23 - 02:49:23] permission once again mr mccracken
[02:49:23 - 02:49:27] will present an overview and
[02:49:27 - 02:49:29] answer question thank you uh
[02:49:29 - 02:49:30] this is for separation systems
[02:49:30 - 02:49:32] consultant they do our environmental
[02:49:32 - 02:49:34] consulting so anytime we have
[02:49:34 - 02:49:34] an air quality concern if
[02:49:34 - 02:49:35] there's a concern about asbestous
[02:49:35 - 02:49:37] maint containing material if we
[02:49:37 - 02:49:39] have to do a mold
[02:49:39 - 02:49:39] assessment they're able to come
[02:49:39 - 02:49:41] in and do that work
[02:49:41 - 02:49:44] they also help us maintain
[02:49:44 - 02:49:44] um all of the licenses
[02:49:44 - 02:49:45] in terms of all the
[02:49:45 - 02:49:45] permittings that we have so
[02:49:47 - 02:49:47] if we have permits that
[02:49:47 - 02:49:48] we have to have inspections
[02:49:48 - 02:49:48] on to help us make
[02:49:48 - 02:49:50] sure that we're keeping all
[02:49:50 - 02:49:52] of those things inspected this
[02:49:52 - 02:49:52] amount is a not to
[02:49:54 - 02:49:54] exceed it's a fee for
[02:49:54 - 02:49:55] service we expect to actually
[02:49:55 - 02:49:58] can spend considerably less than
[02:49:58 - 02:49:59] that uh the challenge with
[02:49:59 - 02:50:01] this contract is that when
[02:50:01 - 02:50:01] we have major incidents where
[02:50:01 - 02:50:03] we have major water intrusion
[02:50:03 - 02:50:05] we end up having to
[02:50:05 - 02:50:05] do a lot of it
[02:50:05 - 02:50:06] and so this gives us
[02:50:06 - 02:50:06] a little bit of flexibility
[02:50:09 - 02:50:09] over in terms of the
[02:50:09 - 02:50:11] overall amount um but our
[02:50:11 - 02:50:11] prior year spend was under
[02:50:14 - 02:50:14] 100 000 we have added
[02:50:14 - 02:50:17] some services to this but
[02:50:17 - 02:50:17] we expect it to um
[02:50:17 - 02:50:20] come out of the facilities
[02:50:20 - 02:50:26] budget proceeds any questions yeah
[02:50:26 - 02:50:26] mr mccracken is this firm
[02:50:26 - 02:50:28] the incumbent firm it is
[02:50:28 - 02:50:32] not okay is this a
[02:50:32 - 02:50:34] serve since it's a professional
[02:50:34 - 02:50:34] service and i've had these
[02:50:36 - 02:50:36] conversations in the past these
[02:50:36 - 02:50:40] are qualifications based solicitations so
[02:50:43 - 02:50:43] could we in theory have
[02:50:43 - 02:50:43] more than one could we
[02:50:43 - 02:50:44] in theory have more than
[02:50:44 - 02:50:47] one provider provider we could
[02:50:47 - 02:50:47] we could do this a
[02:50:47 - 02:50:49] couple of different ways u
[02:50:49 - 02:50:51] the decision was made to
[02:50:51 - 02:50:51] do this as a as
[02:50:51 - 02:50:52] a contract and bring it
[02:50:52 - 02:50:52] before the board this could
[02:50:52 - 02:50:54] have also been broken into
[02:50:54 - 02:50:55] smaller contracts under the chancellor's
[02:50:55 - 02:50:58] signature authority um this particular
[02:50:58 - 02:51:00] vendor is a small business
[02:51:00 - 02:51:02] and they're subbing out 25
[02:51:02 - 02:51:02] of the work to two
[02:51:02 - 02:51:04] additional small businesses um so
[02:51:04 - 02:51:06] we're kind of we're exceeding
[02:51:06 - 02:51:06] the small business goal but
[02:51:08 - 02:51:08] to your point this is
[02:51:08 - 02:51:10] one of those items that
[02:51:10 - 02:51:10] we could have managed without
[02:51:12 - 02:51:12] bringing it to the board
[02:51:12 - 02:51:13] through some of the the
[02:51:13 - 02:51:15] other um i i don't
[02:51:15 - 02:51:15] know if that was the
[02:51:15 - 02:51:17] point i was trying to
[02:51:17 - 02:51:20] make but i understand uh
[02:51:20 - 02:51:20] your sentiment i i just
[02:51:21 - 02:51:21] you've answered the question though
[02:51:21 - 02:51:22] you've answered the question though
[02:51:23 - 02:51:25] thanks thanks thank you if
[02:51:25 - 02:51:29] there's no further questions and
[02:51:29 - 02:51:31] we're ready to vote on
[02:51:31 - 02:51:42] item e professional environmental voting
[02:51:42 - 02:51:42] has concluded the motion passed
[02:51:46 - 02:51:46] with a vote of nine
[02:51:46 - 02:51:48] to zero is there thank
[02:51:48 - 02:51:48] you is there a motion
[02:51:48 - 02:51:51] to approve item f increase

[02:51:57 - 02:51:59] services project number rfp 19
[02:51:59 - 02:52:01] to 56 so move second
[02:52:03 - 02:52:03] been moved and seconded dr
[02:52:03 - 02:52:05] ford fisher will now introduce
[02:52:05 - 02:52:06] the item thank you madam
[02:52:06 - 02:52:08] chair members of the board
[02:52:08 - 02:52:08] this item is a recommendation
[02:52:08 - 02:52:10] for the board's consideration to
[02:52:10 - 02:52:12] authorize the chancellor to approve
[02:52:12 - 02:52:14] an increase in spending authority
[02:52:14 - 02:52:17] for the contract with tdi
[02:52:17 - 02:52:18] industries incorporated to continue providing
[02:52:18 - 02:52:21] facilities maintenance services in accordance
[02:52:21 - 02:52:23] with rfp 19-56 and with
[02:52:23 - 02:52:25] your permission madame chair vice
[02:52:25 - 02:52:28] chancellor mccracken will provide an
[02:52:28 - 02:52:28] overview and respond to questions
[02:52:31 - 02:52:31] thank you um so 5
[02:52:31 - 02:52:32] years ago the board approved
[02:52:32 - 02:52:35] a 10-year contract which included
[02:52:35 - 02:52:35] a 5-year base term plus
[02:52:35 - 02:52:38] five one-year options at the
[02:52:38 - 02:52:41] tail end of that the
[02:52:41 - 02:52:41] uh term that was approved
[02:52:41 - 02:52:43] had a flat rate in
[02:52:43 - 02:52:46] the board approval item for
[02:52:46 - 02:52:46] all 10 years the actual
[02:52:46 - 02:52:49] pricing proposal submitted by the
[02:52:49 - 02:52:51] contractor um had a flat
[02:52:51 - 02:52:51] rate for the first five
[02:52:54 - 02:52:54] years followed by a series
[02:52:54 - 02:52:56] of 1 increases over the
[02:52:56 - 02:52:59] following five option years um
[02:52:59 - 02:52:59] and what we're asking for
[02:52:59 - 02:53:00] is that increase which would
[02:53:00 - 02:53:03] amount to 919 000 over
[02:53:03 - 02:53:03] the course of the next
[02:53:03 - 02:53:05] 5 years and what you
[02:53:05 - 02:53:05] see is that price is
[02:53:07 - 02:53:07] increasing by 1 a year
[02:53:07 - 02:53:10] each of the next 5
[02:53:10 - 02:53:11] years i'd be happy to
[02:53:11 - 02:53:13] answer any questions this is
[02:53:13 - 02:53:13] the firm that provides all
[02:53:13 - 02:53:16] of your mechanical electrical plumbing
[02:53:18 - 02:53:23] services throughout the system does
[02:53:23 - 02:53:23] it also um include uh
[02:53:23 - 02:53:25] like custodial no that's a
[02:53:25 - 02:53:27] separate contract for for custodial
[02:53:27 - 02:53:28] but it includes your fire
[02:53:28 - 02:53:30] you're you're basically behind the
[02:53:30 - 02:53:34] scenes equipment that you don't
[02:53:34 - 02:53:34] see um is this firm
[02:53:36 - 02:53:39] trustees any questions i have
[02:53:39 - 02:53:39] a question um most contracts
[02:53:42 - 02:53:42] that we review here five
[02:53:42 - 02:53:44] years what's so special about
[02:53:44 - 02:53:47] this one i wasn't involved
[02:53:47 - 02:53:47] in this when it was
[02:53:49 - 02:53:49] done 5 years ago um
[02:53:49 - 02:53:50] but one of the challenges
[02:53:50 - 02:53:52] when you're changing major providers
[02:53:52 - 02:53:52] they also operate or building
[02:53:55 - 02:53:55] automation systems um and they
[02:53:55 - 02:53:56] have to be familiar with
[02:53:56 - 02:53:58] all of our equipment so
[02:53:58 - 02:54:00] there's a considerable transition cost
[02:54:00 - 02:54:00] when you transition to a
[02:54:00 - 02:54:02] new provider as you kind
[02:54:02 - 02:54:04] of do that learning curve
[02:54:04 - 02:54:04] to get up to speed
[02:54:04 - 02:54:06] i assume that that is
[02:54:06 - 02:54:06] the a portion of why
[02:54:06 - 02:54:09] we ask for the longer
[02:54:09 - 02:54:09] term but with the one-year
[02:54:10 - 02:54:10] options so that if they
[02:54:10 - 02:54:12] were underperforming or not performing
[02:54:12 - 02:54:14] up to standard that we
[02:54:14 - 02:54:17] don't have to continue how
[02:54:17 - 02:54:17] are you analyzing or evaluating
[02:54:17 - 02:54:18] if they're performing up to
[02:54:18 - 02:54:22] standard or not especially in
[02:54:22 - 02:54:24] the context of cost competition
[02:54:24 - 02:54:26] if they've had this for
[02:54:26 - 02:54:26] five years and so in
[02:54:26 - 02:54:28] year six how do we
[02:54:28 - 02:54:30] gauge that uh so on
[02:54:30 - 02:54:30] the on the cost side
[02:54:30 - 02:54:33] i i think that there
[02:54:33 - 02:54:33] are very few services that
[02:54:33 - 02:54:34] we could get where we
[02:54:34 - 02:54:36] didn't have a price increase
[02:54:36 - 02:54:36] for 5 years and then
[02:54:36 - 02:54:39] we're only going up by
[02:54:39 - 02:54:41] 1 in the original proposal
[02:54:41 - 02:54:43] their cost was significantly lower
[02:54:43 - 02:54:43] than the other biders uh
[02:54:43 - 02:54:45] when we went back and
[02:54:45 - 02:54:45] looked at that in terms
[02:54:47 - 02:54:47] of performance i i would
[02:54:47 - 02:54:50] point to the fact that
[02:54:50 - 02:54:50] we're doing close to 70
[02:54:50 - 02:54:53] 000 uh work orders each
[02:54:53 - 02:54:53] year um that we have
[02:54:57 - 02:54:57] relatively few unplanned outages due
[02:54:57 - 02:54:59] to major systems despite kind
[02:54:59 - 02:55:01] of a backlog of deferred
[02:55:01 - 02:55:03] maintenance um and that they're
[02:55:03 - 02:55:04] helping us prioritize that deferred
[02:55:04 - 02:55:05] maintenance so that we're getting
[02:55:05 - 02:55:05] the most bang for the
[02:55:05 - 02:55:07] buck when we are spending
[02:55:07 - 02:55:11] money you would offer that
[02:55:11 - 02:55:13] it's a general consensus amongst
[02:55:13 - 02:55:16] your facilities maintenance team that
[02:55:16 - 02:55:16] this firm is performing up
[02:55:16 - 02:55:18] to as far as i
[02:55:18 - 02:55:21] know yes there may be
[02:55:21 - 02:55:21] any given day there may
[02:55:21 - 02:55:23] be a particular issue with
[02:55:23 - 02:55:26] a particular you know item
[02:55:26 - 02:55:28] but overall yes okay i
[02:55:28 - 02:55:28] think it's it's just important
[02:55:31 - 02:55:31] for us and this is
[02:55:31 - 02:55:32] an unusual kind of arrangement
[02:55:32 - 02:55:36] relative to everything else that
[02:55:36 - 02:55:36] we typically consider till perhaps
[02:55:38 - 02:55:38] before this time i mean
[02:55:38 - 02:55:40] this is august next year
[02:55:40 - 02:55:40] so maybe by next spring
[02:55:40 - 02:55:43] we can at least get
[02:55:43 - 02:55:46] some update about how this
[02:55:46 - 02:55:46] contract is performing just so
[02:55:46 - 02:55:48] you know we we we
[02:55:48 - 02:55:48] continue to have a good
[02:55:50 - 02:55:50] sense of what's going on
[02:55:50 - 02:55:53] it's it's a it's a
[02:55:53 - 02:55:53] long contract to have the
[02:55:53 - 02:55:56] same sort of company at
[02:55:56 - 02:55:58] the till um but notwithstanding
[02:55:58 - 02:55:58] what happened in 2019 i
[02:56:01 - 02:56:03] i recognize that prices have
[02:56:03 - 02:56:03] grown since then but i
[02:56:03 - 02:56:05] just think it's important that
[02:56:05 - 02:56:06] we we at least have
[02:56:06 - 02:56:06] a good sense of how
[02:56:06 - 02:56:07] we're doing have a good
[02:56:07 - 02:56:07] sense of how we're doing
[02:56:07 - 02:56:09] relative relative we we can
[02:56:09 - 02:56:09] certainly do that and i
[02:56:09 - 02:56:11] think um we we can
[02:56:11 - 02:56:11] also try to address it
[02:56:11 - 02:56:13] when we do deferred maintenance
[02:56:13 - 02:56:14] presentations as well i think
[02:56:14 - 02:56:17] there's some places that it
[02:56:17 - 02:56:18] fits in pretty cleanly thank
[02:56:18 - 02:56:21] you no further questions then
[02:56:21 - 02:56:24] we now vote on item

[02:57:31 - 02:57:34] questions thank you um this
[02:57:34 - 02:57:36] item is actually to to
[02:57:36 - 02:57:36] correct a mistake and what
[02:57:36 - 02:57:40] we brought to the board
[02:57:40 - 02:57:40] um a while back almost
[02:57:40 - 02:57:43] a year ago um in
[02:57:43 - 02:57:46] the original contract it did
[02:57:46 - 02:57:46] they used the prior year
[02:57:46 - 02:57:49] spend as the amount asked
[02:57:49 - 02:57:49] for as opposed to using
[02:57:52 - 02:57:52] the staffing pattern that was
[02:57:52 - 02:57:54] requested and the salaries that
[02:57:54 - 02:57:56] were bid um and when
[02:57:56 - 02:57:56] we look at th those
[02:57:56 - 02:57:58] salaries which are are higher
[02:57:58 - 02:57:58] than what they were under
[02:58:00 - 02:58:00] the previous contract we've also
[02:58:02 - 02:58:02] increased the number of posts
[02:58:02 - 02:58:04] that are being covered by
[02:58:04 - 02:58:05] increasing coverage on a couple
[02:58:05 - 02:58:05] of the floors that we
[02:58:05 - 02:58:07] now occupy that were previously
[02:58:07 - 02:58:10] occupied by tenants as well
[02:58:10 - 02:58:13] as increasing 24 7 coverage
[02:58:13 - 02:58:13] in the parking garage area
[02:58:13 - 02:58:15] um that increases the total
[02:58:15 - 02:58:17] amount um that's required to
[02:58:17 - 02:58:20] maintain the current level of
[02:58:20 - 02:58:23] services be happy to answer
[02:58:23 - 02:58:23] any questions is any be
[02:58:23 - 02:58:24] happy to answer any questions
[02:58:24 - 02:58:27] is any questions questions i
[02:58:27 - 02:58:27] think some clarification might be
[02:58:30 - 02:58:30] helpful if i'm understanding the
[02:58:30 - 02:58:34] item there was a 20
[02:58:34 - 02:58:36] increase in salaries and roughly
[02:58:36 - 02:58:36] and roughly a 35 increase
[02:58:38 - 02:58:38] in the number of posts
[02:58:38 - 02:58:38] that were in the number
[02:58:39 - 02:58:40] of posts that were covered
[02:58:40 - 02:58:44] covered salaries go up 20
[02:58:44 - 02:58:46] and then the coverage expands
[02:58:46 - 02:58:48] by 35 which takes you
[02:58:48 - 02:58:52] from roughly 500 to roughly
[02:58:52 - 02:58:52] 900 um and this leaves
[02:58:52 - 02:58:55] a little bit of room
[02:58:55 - 02:58:55] in there the the 500
[02:58:58 - 02:58:58] was also prior year so
[02:58:58 - 02:59:01] that was 2023 not 2020
[02:59:11 - 02:59:11] simple math 500 000 20
[02:59:11 - 02:59:15] is 600 000 35 of
[02:59:15 - 02:59:15] that is roughly 215 000
[02:59:17 - 02:59:17] so if you add that
[02:59:17 - 02:59:17] so we're at 815 so
[02:59:17 - 02:59:18] if you add that so
[02:59:18 - 02:59:19] we're at 815 850 850
[02:59:21 - 02:59:21] you may be correct on
[02:59:21 - 02:59:22] the math we we took
[02:59:22 - 02:59:22] the staffing pattern and did
[02:59:22 - 02:59:25] the math out math out
[02:59:26 - 02:59:28] yeah yeah it's i guess
[02:59:28 - 02:59:28] it's a math thing because
[02:59:31 - 02:59:31] from 500 000 if you
[02:59:31 - 02:59:35] increase that to 600 000
[02:59:35 - 02:59:35] as your baseline 35 of
[02:59:35 - 02:59:37] 600 000 is exactly 210
[02:59:37 - 02:59:40] 000 and you add that
[02:59:40 - 02:59:43] to 600 000 that's 810
[02:59:43 - 02:59:43] 000 this is going from
[02:59:43 - 02:59:46] 500 to 100 uh to
[02:59:46 - 02:59:46] to a million dollars so
[02:59:46 - 02:59:50] that's about a delta of
[02:59:50 - 02:59:51] let's even say roughly 150
[02:59:51 - 02:59:51] that's not accounted for so
[02:59:51 - 02:59:53] i mean it's a pretty
[02:59:53 - 02:59:53] big jump and i think
[02:59:53 - 02:59:55] it's just worthy of us
[02:59:55 - 02:59:57] fully understanding how that's adding
[02:59:57 - 03:00:02] up yeah and you're right
[03:00:02 - 03:00:02] um the 20 is on
[03:00:06 - 03:00:06] the salary for the officer
[03:00:06 - 03:00:07] it does not include the
[03:00:07 - 03:00:07] salary which is a little
[03:00:08 - 03:00:09] bit bigger jump on the
[03:00:09 - 03:00:12] supervisor that's there um and
[03:00:12 - 03:00:12] to your point it doesn't
[03:00:14 - 03:00:14] come out to exactly a
[03:00:14 - 03:00:16] million it comes out to
[03:00:16 - 03:00:16] less than a million um
[03:00:16 - 03:00:19] it was nine something when
[03:00:19 - 03:00:19] we did the math out
[03:00:21 - 03:00:21] um and this this is
[03:00:21 - 03:00:24] a not to exceed contract
[03:00:24 - 03:00:24] again so it's based upon
[03:00:24 - 03:00:28] the the needs that can
[03:00:28 - 03:00:29] go up or down and
[03:00:29 - 03:00:29] i'll just ask if we
[03:00:29 - 03:00:33] can get an update on
[03:00:33 - 03:00:33] this by you know april
[03:00:33 - 03:00:33] may of update on this
[03:00:33 - 03:00:33] by you know april may
[03:00:34 - 03:00:36] of 2026 2026 we can
[03:00:36 - 03:00:36] do that we can actually
[03:00:36 - 03:00:37] see if i may suggest
[03:00:37 - 03:00:37] we can do an update
[03:00:37 - 03:00:40] on it in january when
[03:00:40 - 03:00:40] we do a update on
[03:00:42 - 03:00:44] campus security okay good all
[03:00:44 - 03:00:49] right my question is um
[03:00:49 - 03:00:51] this security is just for
[03:00:51 - 03:00:53] this building correct here and
[03:00:53 - 03:00:53] across the street yes here
[03:00:53 - 03:00:53] and across the street yes
[03:00:53 - 03:00:54] right right yes we compared
[03:00:56 - 03:00:56] parking garage and this here
[03:00:58 - 03:00:58] right and we compared the
[03:00:58 - 03:01:02] cost to doing it with
[03:01:02 - 03:01:02] our in-house um hiring employees
[03:01:05 - 03:01:05] instead to do it uh
[03:01:05 - 03:01:09] effectively we are paying this
[03:01:09 - 03:01:09] company the same salary um
[03:01:10 - 03:01:10] that we would be paying
[03:01:10 - 03:01:12] our employees but we would
[03:01:12 - 03:01:14] have the additional benefit cost
[03:01:14 - 03:01:14] on top so we could
[03:01:14 - 03:01:17] hire our own staff to
[03:01:17 - 03:01:17] do it um but it
[03:01:17 - 03:01:22] would be more expensive roughly
[03:01:22 - 03:01:25] 30 well because um as
[03:01:25 - 03:01:25] we come in and out
[03:01:25 - 03:01:29] of this building i see
[03:01:29 - 03:01:29] more of our um police
[03:01:29 - 03:01:34] department present than i do
[03:01:34 - 03:01:36] security company so you know
[03:01:36 - 03:01:36] uh other than the the
[03:01:36 - 03:01:39] front desk you know that's
[03:01:39 - 03:01:40] the only one where that
[03:01:40 - 03:01:42] i see so there's also
[03:01:42 - 03:01:42] one that's on the uh
[03:01:42 - 03:01:44] on the first floor cuz
[03:01:44 - 03:01:44] we have an entrance down
[03:01:44 - 03:01:47] there that's correct we also
[03:01:47 - 03:01:49] have them patrolling the parking
[03:01:49 - 03:01:49] garage we also have them
[03:01:49 - 03:01:52] on several other floors um
[03:01:52 - 03:01:55] working and we have them
[03:01:55 - 03:01:55] also roaming the building um
[03:01:57 - 03:01:57] part of what you see
[03:01:57 - 03:01:58] during the board meetings is
[03:01:58 - 03:01:58] because we have a public
[03:02:00 - 03:02:00] meeting we rotate coverage a
[03:02:00 - 03:02:02] little bit more to this
[03:02:02 - 03:02:04] building than normally normally there's
[03:02:04 - 03:02:04] an officer here um but
[03:02:05 - 03:02:05] you do see more because
[03:02:05 - 03:02:07] we want to make sure
[03:02:07 - 03:02:07] that while we have public
[03:02:07 - 03:02:09] meetings that we kind of
[03:02:09 - 03:02:10] increase that coverage so part
[03:02:10 - 03:02:10] of what you're seeing is
[03:02:10 - 03:02:14] an increase um the these
[03:02:14 - 03:02:15] officers because they're security guards
[03:02:15 - 03:02:17] they're not fully commissioned police
[03:02:17 - 03:02:19] officers are considerably less expensive
[03:02:19 - 03:02:27] than fully okay thank you
[03:02:27 - 03:02:28] trusty she first want to
[03:02:28 - 03:02:30] thank our security contractors for
[03:02:30 - 03:02:31] everything they do to keep
[03:02:31 - 03:02:31] us and the public who
[03:02:31 - 03:02:35] joins us in here safe
[03:02:35 - 03:02:35] um also cur i mean
[03:02:35 - 03:02:37] a 100 increase in cost
[03:02:37 - 03:02:37] is a it's a big
[03:02:39 - 03:02:39] increase and putting my project
[03:02:39 - 03:02:41] manager hat on starts to
[03:02:41 - 03:02:44] get into the question of
[03:02:44 - 03:02:44] was it bid and scoped
[03:02:44 - 03:02:46] correctly if we're finding after
[03:02:46 - 03:02:48] the fact that we've got
[03:02:48 - 03:02:48] to increase this much and
[03:02:48 - 03:02:49] we're halfway through my understanding
[03:02:49 - 03:02:51] is we're like halfway through
[03:02:51 - 03:02:53] a two-year contract term right
[03:02:53 - 03:02:53] contract term right roughly roughly
[03:02:54 - 03:02:57] yeah roughly yeah so and
[03:02:57 - 03:02:57] i know in here this
[03:02:57 - 03:03:00] this 500 000 increase only
[03:03:00 - 03:03:02] really covers year two and
[03:03:02 - 03:03:02] then we've got the three
[03:03:04 - 03:03:06] one-year options to extend correct
[03:03:06 - 03:03:09] um so longwinded way of
[03:03:09 - 03:03:11] saying i i hope that
[03:03:11 - 03:03:11] or would love to hear
[03:03:11 - 03:03:13] your thoughts on given the
[03:03:13 - 03:03:15] disconnect between the the bidded
[03:03:15 - 03:03:15] price and the bidded scope
[03:03:15 - 03:03:17] and where we're we find
[03:03:17 - 03:03:19] ourselves is this an opportunity
[03:03:19 - 03:03:19] to rebid at the end
[03:03:19 - 03:03:21] of year two versus carrying
[03:03:21 - 03:03:23] on the one-year contractors just
[03:03:23 - 03:03:23] to make sure that you
[03:03:25 - 03:03:25] know since the the job
[03:03:25 - 03:03:28] has materially changed feels like
[03:03:28 - 03:03:30] an opportunity to to rebid
[03:03:30 - 03:03:30] so it can be rescoped
[03:03:30 - 03:03:31] and all that so curious
[03:03:31 - 03:03:34] for your thoughts on that
[03:03:34 - 03:03:34] i i think that's um
[03:03:34 - 03:03:37] that's certainly an option we
[03:03:37 - 03:03:39] can look at and i'd
[03:03:39 - 03:03:39] need to discuss particularly with
[03:03:42 - 03:03:42] with the police chief in
[03:03:42 - 03:03:44] particular um the other option
[03:03:44 - 03:03:46] that that we've already started
[03:03:46 - 03:03:46] to look at is to
[03:03:46 - 03:03:47] look at because this is
[03:03:47 - 03:03:49] fee for service there's opportunity
[03:03:49 - 03:03:49] for us or there's some
[03:03:49 - 03:03:51] ways that we can maintain
[03:03:51 - 03:03:53] the level of security while
[03:03:53 - 03:03:55] reducing the number of people
[03:03:55 - 03:03:55] it takes to do it
[03:03:55 - 03:03:57] um and we're working on
[03:03:57 - 03:03:57] some things along that line
[03:03:59 - 03:03:59] but we hopefully we can
[03:03:59 - 03:04:01] get those numbers reduced um
[03:04:01 - 03:04:03] to something closer to what
[03:04:03 - 03:04:03] was originally in the in
[03:04:03 - 03:04:03] the to what was originally
[03:04:04 - 03:04:04] in the in the scope
[03:04:04 - 03:04:06] scope and just to be
[03:04:06 - 03:04:06] clear my my concern is
[03:04:08 - 03:04:08] more as again having been
[03:04:08 - 03:04:11] in a project managerial role
[03:04:11 - 03:04:13] where the scope has radically
[03:04:13 - 03:04:13] changed just the the position
[03:04:15 - 03:04:15] of oversight and all that
[03:04:15 - 03:04:17] you just you never catch
[03:04:17 - 03:04:17] up right and so it's
[03:04:17 - 03:04:20] more expensive not that the
[03:04:20 - 03:04:21] individual um security guards and
[03:04:21 - 03:04:23] again thank you all for
[03:04:23 - 03:04:23] everything that you do um
[03:04:23 - 03:04:25] i'm not questioning that and
[03:04:25 - 03:04:26] the service that they bring
[03:04:26 - 03:04:27] it's just there's probably a
[03:04:27 - 03:04:28] more efficient way to administer
[03:04:28 - 03:04:28] the whole thing which might
[03:04:30 - 03:04:30] drive more efficient costs if
[03:04:30 - 03:04:31] we were to rebid it
[03:04:31 - 03:04:31] so that's just something to
[03:04:33 - 03:04:33] consider as we get to
[03:04:33 - 03:04:35] the end of this contract
[03:04:35 - 03:04:35] term and we're looking for
[03:04:35 - 03:04:36] the next three years ahead
[03:04:39 - 03:04:39] i i'm going to echo
[03:04:39 - 03:04:43] trusty chieven's sentiments about that
[03:04:43 - 03:04:45] i mean a 35 increase
[03:04:45 - 03:04:48] in coverage when contractors are
[03:04:48 - 03:04:51] bidden you know there's a
[03:04:51 - 03:04:51] fixed component of how much
[03:04:54 - 03:04:54] service they anticipate manh hours
[03:04:54 - 03:04:56] so on and so forth
[03:04:56 - 03:04:59] there's the fact of economies
[03:04:59 - 03:04:59] of scale so as quantities
[03:05:01 - 03:05:01] increase that might have a
[03:05:01 - 03:05:04] material impact on um on
[03:05:04 - 03:05:07] how people bid their pricing
[03:05:07 - 03:05:07] so i just think it's
[03:05:07 - 03:05:09] important we should take a
[03:05:09 - 03:05:09] look at that we should
[03:05:09 - 03:05:09] take a look at that
[03:05:09 - 03:05:15] okay okay okay so further
[03:05:15 - 03:05:15] questions then we're ready to
[03:05:19 - 03:05:22] vote on item g increase
[03:05:22 - 03:05:43] in spending authority voting has

[03:06:16 - 03:06:19] authorize the chancellor to negotiate
[03:06:19 - 03:06:20] and execute contracts available through
[03:06:20 - 03:06:24] government cooperative purchasing programs using
[03:06:25 - 03:06:25] various items and services that
[03:06:25 - 03:06:29] are approved in the fiscal
[03:06:29 - 03:06:31] year 2026 budget and with
[03:06:31 - 03:06:36] your permission madam chair mr
[03:06:36 - 03:06:36] m dr jerry han uh
[03:06:36 - 03:06:37] cfo will uh provide an
[03:06:37 - 03:06:40] overview and answer all questions
[03:06:40 - 03:06:40] dr han good evening again
[03:06:42 - 03:06:42] everyone um happy to answer
[03:06:42 - 03:06:45] questions about this this uh
[03:06:45 - 03:06:49] topic we've mapped out with
[03:06:49 - 03:06:49] careful work with the end
[03:06:49 - 03:06:51] users to determine what we
[03:06:51 - 03:06:52] think the appropriate costs are
[03:06:52 - 03:06:55] for the various elements the
[03:06:55 - 03:07:00] technology replacement plan 10 9
[03:07:00 - 03:07:00] million for oracle 2 7
[03:07:00 - 03:07:03] million for telecom 880 000
[03:07:06 - 03:07:06] uh for microsoft 570 000
[03:07:08 - 03:07:08] for instructure which actually we're
[03:07:10 - 03:07:10] moving to canvas as a
[03:07:10 - 03:07:14] learning management system over 3
[03:07:14 - 03:07:17] 1 million um staffing services
[03:07:17 - 03:07:21] uh you'll notice this is
[03:07:21 - 03:07:21] renamed it was in fy25
[03:07:24 - 03:07:24] uh contract staffing services for
[03:07:24 - 03:07:26] it this is the more
[03:07:26 - 03:07:28] appropriate description because it staffing
[03:07:28 - 03:07:32] service is not just limited
[03:07:32 - 03:07:32] to it and so it's
[03:07:32 - 03:07:34] 4 2 million for that
[03:07:34 - 03:07:34] food services 2 6 million
[03:07:36 - 03:07:36] roughly and for jocks job
[03:07:36 - 03:07:39] order contracts it's 13 million
[03:07:39 - 03:07:41] uh then two other items
[03:07:41 - 03:07:43] promotional items and office supplies
[03:07:43 - 03:07:43] and furniture the former 1
[03:07:47 - 03:07:47] million and the latter 1
[03:07:47 - 03:07:49] 4 million and again this
[03:07:49 - 03:07:51] was developed over the last
[03:07:51 - 03:07:53] several weeks with multiple meetings
[03:07:53 - 03:07:53] with the end user departments
[03:08:03 - 03:08:05] thank you any questions yes
[03:08:05 - 03:08:07] trusty wilson yes trusty wilson
[03:08:07 - 03:08:10] um um i'm i've always
[03:08:10 - 03:08:12] had a problem understanding how
[03:08:12 - 03:08:15] these cooperatives work i understand
[03:08:15 - 03:08:18] the the mechanics but how
[03:08:18 - 03:08:18] do the people that get
[03:08:18 - 03:08:20] on this list with all
[03:08:20 - 03:08:24] these government entities that get
[03:08:24 - 03:08:24] their name in the pot
[03:08:24 - 03:08:26] uh to kind of have
[03:08:26 - 03:08:26] a corner on the market
[03:08:26 - 03:08:30] on the some of these
[03:08:30 - 03:08:33] products and i've also always
[03:08:33 - 03:08:33] wondered if at some point
[03:08:33 - 03:08:36] in time maybe is it
[03:08:36 - 03:08:36] not cheaper if we went
[03:08:40 - 03:08:40] and negotiated with oracal and
[03:08:40 - 03:08:43] these uh other companies privately
[03:08:43 - 03:08:45] if we' have got a
[03:08:45 - 03:08:48] better deal so actually um
[03:08:48 - 03:08:51] the companies work with the
[03:08:51 - 03:08:51] state to become part of
[03:08:51 - 03:08:52] their larger group lists group
[03:08:52 - 03:08:55] lists yeah yeah like di
[03:08:55 - 03:08:55] for example and then in
[03:08:56 - 03:08:58] the case of how it
[03:08:58 - 03:09:00] works internally here if we
[03:09:00 - 03:09:00] find a better deal with
[03:09:00 - 03:09:02] another vendor or the same
[03:09:02 - 03:09:05] vendor that might be outside
[03:09:05 - 03:09:05] of the co-op we will
[03:09:05 - 03:09:06] pursue that because we're looking
[03:09:06 - 03:09:09] to save money rather than
[03:09:09 - 03:09:09] spend it so this gives
[03:09:09 - 03:09:11] us the freedom to use
[03:09:11 - 03:09:14] that vendor under the co-op
[03:09:14 - 03:09:14] arrangement if we need to
[03:09:14 - 03:09:16] but i believe it has
[03:09:16 - 03:09:19] benefited by shopping outside of
[03:09:19 - 03:09:19] the co-op in particular in
[03:09:20 - 03:09:20] certain instances where they felt
[03:09:20 - 03:09:22] they could save money and
[03:09:22 - 03:09:24] they did in which case
[03:09:24 - 03:09:24] in which case the co-op
[03:09:24 - 03:09:27] dollars weren't fully expended in
[03:09:27 - 03:09:31] that year so we're not
[03:09:31 - 03:09:31] tied in to committed to
[03:09:32 - 03:09:32] buying all of our stuff
[03:09:32 - 03:09:33] from all of these vendors
[03:09:33 - 03:09:34] in the co-op that's right
[03:09:37 - 03:09:37] it's a it's a an
[03:09:37 - 03:09:37] option for us but if
[03:09:40 - 03:09:40] we go shop it separately
[03:09:40 - 03:09:41] and we do that you're
[03:09:41 - 03:09:42] saying you're saying correct correct
[03:09:43 - 03:09:45] that's that's good absolutely right
[03:09:45 - 03:09:45] so this is just one
[03:09:48 - 03:09:48] avenue that they may be
[03:09:48 - 03:09:51] cheaper because they've all become
[03:09:51 - 03:09:51] a co-op and got the
[03:09:52 - 03:09:55] large volume and the the
[03:09:55 - 03:09:55] benefit here to us is
[03:09:55 - 03:09:56] is sort of an efficiency
[03:09:56 - 03:09:58] measure instead instead of having
[03:09:58 - 03:10:00] to go through the purchasing
[03:10:00 - 03:10:00] process from a to z
[03:10:00 - 03:10:02] every time this gives us
[03:10:02 - 03:10:06] sort of the high-speed occupancy
[03:10:06 - 03:10:07] lane to get that whatever
[03:10:07 - 03:10:07] good or service we need
[03:10:07 - 03:10:09] more quickly because the arrangement's
[03:10:12 - 03:10:12] already made with through the
[03:10:12 - 03:10:14] co-op so it benefits us
[03:10:14 - 03:10:14] when we want it to
[03:10:14 - 03:10:17] but if we're not we're
[03:10:17 - 03:10:17] not married to it if
[03:10:17 - 03:10:18] we don't want to use
[03:10:18 - 03:10:21] them when a vendor sees
[03:10:21 - 03:10:23] the co-op price and they
[03:10:23 - 03:10:23] see an opportunity to get
[03:10:23 - 03:10:25] the business they're maybe more
[03:10:25 - 03:10:27] inclined to lower their price
[03:10:29 - 03:10:29] i can't speak for them
[03:10:29 - 03:10:31] but i can see that
[03:10:31 - 03:10:33] that's a possibility yes okay
[03:10:33 - 03:10:35] gotcha thank you trusty vanderville
[03:10:37 - 03:10:37] um how many student loaner
[03:10:37 - 03:10:43] laptops do it depends on
[03:10:43 - 03:10:43] the vendor it depends on
[03:10:45 - 03:10:49] the vendor got to have
[03:10:49 - 03:10:52] an average how many for
[03:10:52 - 03:10:54] 125 000 i don't know
[03:10:54 - 03:10:54] roughly three or 400 i
[03:10:54 - 03:10:55] don't know roughly three or
[03:10:55 - 03:10:56] 400 each each i'm sorry
[03:10:58 - 03:11:01] we get approximately 400 so
[03:11:01 - 03:11:01] 400 laptops and the computer
[03:11:04 - 03:11:04] replacement for 5 6 million
[03:11:04 - 03:11:06] and change what is what
[03:11:06 - 03:11:06] computer replacement is what is
[03:11:06 - 03:11:07] what computer replacement is that
[03:11:07 - 03:11:11] that that's for the um
[03:11:11 - 03:11:14] the computer labs the faculty
[03:11:14 - 03:11:14] and staff laptops that's across
[03:11:16 - 03:11:16] the district and so it's
[03:11:16 - 03:11:19] based on a four-year plan
[03:11:19 - 03:11:19] and i can get you
[03:11:19 - 03:11:21] the numbers of the devices
[03:11:21 - 03:11:30] i don't believe when you
[03:11:30 - 03:11:30] came to the audit committee
[03:11:30 - 03:11:32] and you did a presentation
[03:11:34 - 03:11:34] several of these things were
[03:11:34 - 03:11:43] not listed i'm not sure
[03:11:43 - 03:11:44] what you're referring to i'm
[03:11:44 - 03:11:47] i'm sorry uh you came
[03:11:47 - 03:11:47] mr jackson you came to
[03:11:49 - 03:11:49] the audit committee with a
[03:11:49 - 03:11:52] presentation some time ago and
[03:11:52 - 03:11:54] in that presentation you were
[03:11:54 - 03:11:54] explaining some of these items
[03:11:57 - 03:11:59] but not all we started
[03:11:59 - 03:12:01] with the switch upgrades you've
[03:12:01 - 03:12:01] all you've done some switch
[03:12:04 - 03:12:04] upgrades if if i'm not
[03:12:04 - 03:12:06] mistaken they were done in
[03:12:06 - 03:12:06] the last they were done
[03:12:06 - 03:12:11] in the last budget they
[03:12:11 - 03:12:11] were done a majority of
[03:12:11 - 03:12:15] the switch upgrades were done
[03:12:15 - 03:12:18] with um the majority started
[03:12:18 - 03:12:18] with the fiscal year 2024
[03:12:20 - 03:12:20] budget we were given extra
[03:12:20 - 03:12:21] money at the end of
[03:12:21 - 03:12:21] the year and then also
[03:12:22 - 03:12:26] fiscal year 25 and so
[03:12:26 - 03:12:26] all that is left is
[03:12:26 - 03:12:28] this to purchase is this
[03:12:28 - 03:12:29] building we're still installing them
[03:12:29 - 03:12:30] across the still installing them
[03:12:30 - 03:12:33] across the district district so
[03:12:33 - 03:12:33] how many switch upgrades did
[03:12:33 - 03:12:34] we make did we purchase
[03:12:34 - 03:12:36] how many switches did we
[03:12:36 - 03:12:36] purchase for upgrade let me
[03:12:36 - 03:12:37] correct we purchase for upgrade
[03:12:37 - 03:12:37] let me correct that that
[03:12:40 - 03:12:40] in total it will be
[03:12:40 - 03:12:43] around we had 332 to
[03:12:43 - 03:12:46] upgrade there were 47 that
[03:12:46 - 03:12:46] were going to be combined
[03:12:46 - 03:12:47] into there were smaller switches
[03:12:47 - 03:12:48] that were going to be
[03:12:48 - 03:12:51] combined into the larger chassis
[03:12:51 - 03:12:51] switches so that would have
[03:12:55 - 03:12:55] knocked us down to 285
[03:12:55 - 03:12:55] i believe is the knocked
[03:12:55 - 03:12:55] us down to 285 i
[03:12:55 - 03:12:56] believe is the number number
[03:13:00 - 03:13:00] okay and 285 switches for
[03:13:00 - 03:13:03] this year no that was
[03:13:03 - 03:13:03] total that was total so
[03:13:03 - 03:13:06] a million one for the
[03:13:06 - 03:13:06] total number of million one
[03:13:06 - 03:13:07] for the total number of
[03:13:07 - 03:13:09] switches switches for for this
[03:13:09 - 03:13:09] year which is just this
[03:13:09 - 03:13:10] for for this year which
[03:13:10 - 03:13:11] is just this building building
[03:13:13 - 03:13:13] and there are typically two
[03:13:13 - 03:13:17] switches on every floor and
[03:13:17 - 03:13:21] we have 12 floors we
[03:13:21 - 03:13:21] don't we don't have switches
[03:13:21 - 03:13:24] on every floor yet but
[03:13:24 - 03:13:26] we're we're getting there we
[03:13:26 - 03:13:26] don't have six we don't
[03:13:26 - 03:13:40] have when the audit committee
[03:13:40 - 03:13:42] requested information on technology the
[03:13:45 - 03:13:48] technology replacement plan several of
[03:13:48 - 03:13:48] these items were not listed
[03:13:50 - 03:13:50] the discussion was limited to
[03:13:50 - 03:13:52] the the discussion was limited
[03:13:52 - 03:13:56] to the switches why was
[03:13:56 - 03:14:01] that i think most of
[03:14:01 - 03:14:01] the items i think most
[03:14:01 - 03:14:02] of the things we talked
[03:14:02 - 03:14:04] about were was the switch
[03:14:04 - 03:14:04] upgrade which is coming to
[03:14:04 - 03:14:06] an end and then our
[03:14:06 - 03:14:09] standard computer replacement which we
[03:14:09 - 03:14:11] do that amount that's a
[03:14:11 - 03:14:11] much easier one to budget
[03:14:11 - 03:14:13] it's basically do a quarter
[03:14:13 - 03:14:16] of them a year and
[03:14:16 - 03:14:16] so it's it's more even
[03:14:16 - 03:14:16] across the and so it's
[03:14:16 - 03:14:17] it's more even across the
[03:14:17 - 03:14:21] years years and at the
[03:14:21 - 03:14:23] meeting the switch upgrades were
[03:14:23 - 03:14:23] seemingly more reasonable than a
[03:14:26 - 03:14:26] million1 and that's the question
[03:14:26 - 03:14:29] i'm asking so now we
[03:14:29 - 03:14:32] have 285 switches that we
[03:14:32 - 03:14:32] will be doing in fiscal
[03:14:32 - 03:14:34] year 2025 i don't remember
[03:14:34 - 03:14:34] that number being 285 don't
[03:14:34 - 03:14:36] remember that number being 285
[03:14:36 - 03:14:38] switches switches that's the total
[03:14:38 - 03:14:38] number i think in 2020
[03:14:40 - 03:14:40] i can get you the
[03:14:40 - 03:14:42] numbers for what we purchased
[03:14:42 - 03:14:43] in 2025 i think it
[03:14:43 - 03:14:43] was somewhere in the range
[03:14:43 - 03:14:48] of of a of a
[03:14:48 - 03:14:48] 100 or something like that
[03:14:48 - 03:14:51] um we had tried to
[03:14:51 - 03:14:54] start this project in 2020
[03:14:54 - 03:14:54] and we have we would
[03:14:54 - 03:14:56] request from the finance department
[03:14:56 - 03:14:58] funds we would typically get
[03:14:58 - 03:14:58] a third of what we
[03:15:01 - 03:15:01] requested and of course they
[03:15:01 - 03:15:03] never brought it to the
[03:15:03 - 03:15:05] board it wasn't until 2024
[03:15:05 - 03:15:05] that we started getting the
[03:15:05 - 03:15:08] money we needed and so
[03:15:08 - 03:15:10] last year and this year
[03:15:10 - 03:15:10] we got a majority of
[03:15:10 - 03:15:12] what we needed to do
[03:15:12 - 03:15:14] the switch upright so that
[03:15:14 - 03:15:14] the total cost for everything
[03:15:17 - 03:15:17] tech is at the 15
[03:15:17 - 03:15:17] million that was tech is
[03:15:18 - 03:15:18] at the 15 million that
[03:15:19 - 03:15:21] was requested requested for last
[03:15:21 - 03:15:23] year for last year period
[03:15:23 - 03:15:27] period for this year it's
[03:15:27 - 03:15:30] 10 9 million that's 10
[03:15:30 - 03:15:30] 9 million for column one
[03:15:30 - 03:15:34] i'm asking for the it
[03:15:34 - 03:15:36] requested for 15 million that
[03:15:36 - 03:15:39] was on the budget i'm
[03:15:39 - 03:15:42] not understanding i know last
[03:15:42 - 03:15:42] year was 15 i know
[03:15:42 - 03:15:43] last year was 15 something
[03:15:43 - 03:15:46] something would like to comment
[03:15:46 - 03:15:49] now i think that in
[03:15:49 - 03:15:49] order to provide madame trustee
[03:15:49 - 03:15:52] with the information that is
[03:15:52 - 03:15:54] being requested and the entire
[03:15:54 - 03:15:57] board it would be advantageous
[03:15:57 - 03:15:57] to get the report because
[03:15:57 - 03:15:59] i know you are now
[03:15:59 - 03:16:01] speaking from memory and we
[03:16:01 - 03:16:01] do want to be precise
[03:16:01 - 03:16:04] and to provide the correct
[03:16:04 - 03:16:06] information to the board members
[03:16:06 - 03:16:09] when we are responding so
[03:16:09 - 03:16:09] madame trustee if it is
[03:16:09 - 03:16:12] acceptable to you is it
[03:16:12 - 03:16:12] uh agreeable that we can
[03:16:14 - 03:16:14] get this information and then
[03:16:14 - 03:16:16] uh schedule a meeting with
[03:16:16 - 03:16:18] you to share this information
[03:16:18 - 03:16:20] if at all possible i
[03:16:20 - 03:16:20] think my concern is approving
[03:16:20 - 03:16:22] it before i get that
[03:16:22 - 03:16:22] information i before i get
[03:16:22 - 03:16:22] that information i understand understand
[03:16:24 - 03:16:24] because the the meeting at
[03:16:24 - 03:16:26] the audit committee was very
[03:16:26 - 03:16:28] succinct about what would and
[03:16:28 - 03:16:28] would not be spent and
[03:16:28 - 03:16:31] it was very clear at
[03:16:31 - 03:16:31] the time what we would
[03:16:34 - 03:16:38] agree to do this total
[03:16:38 - 03:16:41] it package leaves leaves a
[03:16:41 - 03:16:41] bit to be desired so
[03:16:41 - 03:16:44] i i would really rather
[03:16:44 - 03:16:49] to see this in detail
[03:16:49 - 03:16:49] before we approve the it
[03:16:51 - 03:16:51] portion of this corporate cooperative
[03:16:53 - 03:16:53] contract award list i know
[03:16:53 - 03:16:57] that we normally say not
[03:16:57 - 03:17:00] to exceed but every year
[03:17:00 - 03:17:00] we agree to so many
[03:17:00 - 03:17:03] millions and every year we
[03:17:03 - 03:17:06] end up spending more millions
[03:17:06 - 03:17:06] out of the fund balance
[03:17:06 - 03:17:08] and i'm not inclined to
[03:17:08 - 03:17:08] do that this year so
[03:17:12 - 03:17:12] can we agree to not
[03:17:12 - 03:17:15] can we agree to remove
[03:17:15 - 03:17:15] the it portion of this
[03:17:15 - 03:17:18] until the audit committee gets
[03:17:18 - 03:17:22] a very clear and defined
[03:17:22 - 03:17:22] or clearly definitive um billing
[03:17:24 - 03:17:24] and understanding because i'm also
[03:17:26 - 03:17:26] seeing oracle on here and
[03:17:26 - 03:17:29] that was something else that
[03:17:29 - 03:17:32] they were looking at from
[03:17:32 - 03:17:32] a different perspective so i
[03:17:32 - 03:17:35] do not have a problem
[03:17:35 - 03:17:38] with approving the remaining corporate
[03:17:38 - 03:17:41] the co cooperative contracts but
[03:17:41 - 03:17:41] i have some i have
[03:17:41 - 03:17:44] some issues with the it
[03:17:44 - 03:17:44] portion of this and i
[03:17:46 - 03:17:46] would really like to see
[03:17:46 - 03:17:48] that so that the audit
[03:17:48 - 03:17:48] committee holds true to what
[03:17:51 - 03:17:52] it agreed to do thank
[03:17:52 - 03:17:56] you uh trust davies yeah
[03:17:56 - 03:18:00] clarifying question dr horn i
[03:18:00 - 03:18:02] recall you mentioning jock contract
[03:18:02 - 03:18:02] as part of the lineup
[03:18:02 - 03:18:04] i think you said it
[03:18:04 - 03:18:04] was 13 million you said
[03:18:04 - 03:18:05] it was 13 million right
[03:18:05 - 03:18:07] right um it's not reflected
[03:18:07 - 03:18:08] on the backup sheet that
[03:18:08 - 03:18:08] we have so i just
[03:18:08 - 03:18:13] wanted to make sure i
[03:18:13 - 03:18:13] i did hear you correctly
[03:18:18 - 03:18:18] um it yeah but it's
[03:18:18 - 03:18:18] part of the fy 2026
[03:18:21 - 03:18:25] cooperative contract award list it's
[03:18:25 - 03:18:25] page two the la uh
[03:18:25 - 03:18:26] it's page two last item
[03:18:26 - 03:18:28] at the bottom yeah the
[03:18:28 - 03:18:28] last item on the bottom
[03:18:28 - 03:18:30] of my page too is
[03:18:30 - 03:18:33] office supplies and furniture for
[03:18:33 - 03:18:33] 1 4 million furniture for
[03:18:34 - 03:18:34] 1 4 million okay okay
[03:18:36 - 03:18:39] was on the board all
[03:18:39 - 03:18:39] right we can get you
[03:18:39 - 03:18:41] this version no yeah it
[03:18:41 - 03:18:41] it just didn't show up
[03:18:43 - 03:18:43] that's why i was trying
[03:18:43 - 03:18:44] to understand um about that
[03:18:45 - 03:18:47] trusty chief please trusty chieman
[03:18:50 - 03:18:50] i just wanted to second
[03:18:50 - 03:18:51] uh the sentiment expressed by
[03:18:51 - 03:18:53] dr vandal stalworth but not
[03:18:53 - 03:18:53] just on the it items
[03:18:53 - 03:18:55] i' i'd prefer if we
[03:18:55 - 03:18:55] wait on this for about
[03:18:55 - 03:18:57] another month um i would
[03:18:57 - 03:18:59] also appreciate seeing the information
[03:18:59 - 03:19:00] that goes into these cost
[03:19:00 - 03:19:00] estimates and i think there's
[03:19:02 - 03:19:02] there's two broader points that
[03:19:02 - 03:19:05] have come up um across
[03:19:05 - 03:19:05] you know at this dis
[03:19:07 - 03:19:07] over the last 11 months
[03:19:07 - 03:19:10] or so since the last
[03:19:10 - 03:19:10] time we talked about this
[03:19:10 - 03:19:12] um a year ago when
[03:19:12 - 03:19:12] this was originally last year
[03:19:14 - 03:19:14] on the agenda we pulled
[03:19:14 - 03:19:16] the item because there was
[03:19:16 - 03:19:18] a lot of consternation i
[03:19:18 - 03:19:18] think justifiably on this side
[03:19:18 - 03:19:20] of the dis um about
[03:19:20 - 03:19:20] the lack of transparency in
[03:19:22 - 03:19:22] the spend over the course
[03:19:22 - 03:19:25] of the year um we
[03:19:25 - 03:19:25] ended up approving it after
[03:19:25 - 03:19:26] we had a pretty robust
[03:19:26 - 03:19:29] discussion at the board table
[03:19:29 - 03:19:29] about the types of updates
[03:19:31 - 03:19:31] this board would like to
[03:19:31 - 03:19:33] see to feel comfortable with
[03:19:33 - 03:19:33] the spend over time i
[03:19:35 - 03:19:35] don't think i saw that
[03:19:35 - 03:19:37] over the last 11 months
[03:19:37 - 03:19:37] i think we had one
[03:19:37 - 03:19:39] update in the web and
[03:19:39 - 03:19:39] i remember that one cuz
[03:19:39 - 03:19:40] trusty wilson highlighted that there
[03:19:40 - 03:19:42] was a half a million
[03:19:42 - 03:19:42] dollar police car u he'd
[03:19:42 - 03:19:44] like to understand what the
[03:19:44 - 03:19:45] heck went into that police
[03:19:45 - 03:19:45] car to make it half
[03:19:45 - 03:19:46] a million dollars um and
[03:19:46 - 03:19:49] then there was the the
[03:19:49 - 03:19:49] audit committee um item that
[03:19:50 - 03:19:52] that trustee vandable stalworth highlighted
[03:19:52 - 03:19:54] um honestly i think that's
[03:19:54 - 03:19:54] insufficient for this level of
[03:19:57 - 03:19:57] spend and while i'm really
[03:19:57 - 03:19:59] grateful dr han the anecdote
[03:19:59 - 03:20:02] you shared about it looking
[03:20:02 - 03:20:02] for lower cost options in
[03:20:02 - 03:20:04] the midst of this construct
[03:20:04 - 03:20:06] uh it still worries me
[03:20:06 - 03:20:06] that we weren't updated as
[03:20:06 - 03:20:07] to that effect because we
[03:20:07 - 03:20:09] would have you know already
[03:20:09 - 03:20:11] approved this 15 million and
[03:20:11 - 03:20:11] we just don't want you
[03:20:11 - 03:20:13] know slush funds to remain
[03:20:13 - 03:20:13] open i mean it's good
[03:20:14 - 03:20:14] that we're finding lowerc cost
[03:20:14 - 03:20:16] options don't get me wrong
[03:20:16 - 03:20:17] but just you know tidying
[03:20:17 - 03:20:17] up and closing those loose
[03:20:17 - 03:20:19] ends i think is pretty
[03:20:19 - 03:20:21] critical another item was something
[03:20:21 - 03:20:22] trusty wilson was highlighting just
[03:20:22 - 03:20:22] a couple of months ago
[03:20:24 - 03:20:24] with some of our other
[03:20:24 - 03:20:26] contracts that there's two types
[03:20:26 - 03:20:28] of procurement one to just
[03:20:28 - 03:20:28] enable activity and the other
[03:20:28 - 03:20:31] to drive accountability and i
[03:20:31 - 03:20:32] really think i mean i
[03:20:32 - 03:20:32] got the sense from this
[03:20:32 - 03:20:34] board that we wanted to
[03:20:34 - 03:20:35] structure our contracting to drive
[03:20:35 - 03:20:38] accountability to overtime lower cost
[03:20:38 - 03:20:41] and i'm worried about proceeding
[03:20:41 - 03:20:41] with this when we don't
[03:20:43 - 03:20:43] quite know where we're going
[03:20:43 - 03:20:45] to uh try to dive
[03:20:45 - 03:20:45] for lower costs by looking
[03:20:45 - 03:20:47] for for specific procurement opportunities
[03:20:49 - 03:20:49] without agreements about what that
[03:20:51 - 03:20:51] transparency looks like in particular
[03:20:53 - 03:20:53] so i i would very
[03:20:53 - 03:20:53] much be in favor of
[03:20:55 - 03:20:55] postponing this i think making
[03:20:55 - 03:20:58] this a question um are
[03:20:58 - 03:21:00] there any items on here
[03:21:00 - 03:21:00] that if we did wait
[03:21:00 - 03:21:02] a month we would disrupt
[03:21:02 - 03:21:03] some critical service where we
[03:21:03 - 03:21:03] would need to maybe separate
[03:21:05 - 03:21:05] the question and specifically approve
[03:21:07 - 03:21:07] those items so that we
[03:21:07 - 03:21:09] can have this you know
[03:21:09 - 03:21:10] much much neededed conversation about
[03:21:10 - 03:21:11] what transparency looks like over
[03:21:11 - 03:21:11] the next year with the
[03:21:11 - 03:21:12] looks like over the next
[03:21:12 - 03:21:12] year with the spend spend
[03:21:14 - 03:21:14] i would worry about the
[03:21:14 - 03:21:17] canvas learning management system i
[03:21:17 - 03:21:19] think they there's probably a
[03:21:19 - 03:21:21] time sensitivity there since it's
[03:21:21 - 03:21:23] planned for fy26 at least
[03:21:23 - 03:21:30] 562 000 i think the
[03:21:30 - 03:21:30] others can we can be
[03:21:30 - 03:21:31] a little bit more flexible
[03:21:31 - 03:21:34] i don't think a month
[03:21:34 - 03:21:37] is going to on the
[03:21:37 - 03:21:39] telecommunication spend we have monthly
[03:21:39 - 03:21:39] bills from at t and
[03:21:39 - 03:21:42] and the other vendors um
[03:21:45 - 03:21:45] and those are basically mostly
[03:21:45 - 03:21:46] under multi-year contracts that we've
[03:21:46 - 03:21:50] already gotten approved we have
[03:21:50 - 03:21:52] at t comcast consolidated communications
[03:21:52 - 03:21:56] crown castle for dark fiber
[03:21:56 - 03:22:00] lumen for our uh voice
[03:22:00 - 03:22:00] sip services nt for internet
[03:22:00 - 03:22:03] ps lightweight for dark fiber
[03:22:03 - 03:22:05] um we have the um
[03:22:05 - 03:22:07] southeast texas gigapot that's not
[03:22:07 - 03:22:07] due until august so that's
[03:22:07 - 03:22:10] not a problem but we
[03:22:10 - 03:22:11] have t-mobile which is the
[03:22:11 - 03:22:11] hotspots for students and faculty
[03:22:13 - 03:22:13] so some of those things
[03:22:13 - 03:22:18] are just monthly bills and
[03:22:18 - 03:22:18] without the uh approval then
[03:22:21 - 03:22:21] we have trouble paying the
[03:22:21 - 03:22:21] september we have trouble paying
[03:22:21 - 03:22:23] the september bill bill well
[03:22:23 - 03:22:23] i'm happy to make the
[03:22:23 - 03:22:25] motion but i don't want
[03:22:25 - 03:22:25] to cut off debate so
[03:22:28 - 03:22:28] still have one more um
[03:22:30 - 03:22:30] yes madam chair i would
[03:22:30 - 03:22:40] also add it appear mr
[03:22:40 - 03:22:40] mccracken got up after i
[03:22:42 - 03:22:42] asked the question about the
[03:22:42 - 03:22:44] jock was there something you
[03:22:44 - 03:22:47] were going to add about
[03:22:47 - 03:22:47] that or provide some context
[03:22:50 - 03:22:50] yeah with the direction that
[03:22:52 - 03:22:52] no no i for me
[03:22:52 - 03:22:54] it would be important because
[03:22:54 - 03:22:54] it's news to me that
[03:22:54 - 03:22:58] we're going through jock as
[03:22:58 - 03:23:00] a delivery mechanism we we've
[03:23:00 - 03:23:00] always used jock as a
[03:23:00 - 03:23:04] delivery mechanism for um building
[03:23:04 - 03:23:07] repairs and and maintenance items
[03:23:07 - 03:23:09] um a lot of those
[03:23:09 - 03:23:09] what you see come through
[03:23:09 - 03:23:11] to you as the board
[03:23:11 - 03:23:11] are the large ones right
[03:23:14 - 03:23:14] where we have to um
[03:23:14 - 03:23:16] if it's over 500 000
[03:23:16 - 03:23:16] those are coming to the
[03:23:16 - 03:23:18] boards as standalone contracts but
[03:23:18 - 03:23:21] there are a lot of
[03:23:21 - 03:23:21] smaller ones that are uh
[03:23:23 - 03:23:23] patching a drywall doing small
[03:23:24 - 03:23:25] minor repairs renovations those types
[03:23:26 - 03:23:27] of things um and so
[03:23:27 - 03:23:28] what i was going to
[03:23:30 - 03:23:30] say is that those are
[03:23:30 - 03:23:31] all individual contracts none of
[03:23:31 - 03:23:34] which exceed the authority or
[03:23:34 - 03:23:34] the 500 000 so you
[03:23:37 - 03:23:37] typically don't see those and
[03:23:37 - 03:23:39] strictly speaking those don't get
[03:23:39 - 03:23:42] tallied up into what shows
[03:23:42 - 03:23:42] up on the co-op list
[03:23:44 - 03:23:44] um so that's why they're
[03:23:44 - 03:23:44] not on the um so
[03:23:45 - 03:23:47] that's why they're not on
[03:23:47 - 03:23:50] the list but they could
[03:23:50 - 03:23:53] be sure go ahead dr
[03:23:56 - 03:23:56] and i will also add
[03:23:56 - 03:23:58] uh that procurement they do
[03:23:58 - 03:23:58] comp even though the co-ops
[03:23:58 - 03:24:00] are not required to compete
[03:24:00 - 03:24:04] them for the jock they
[03:24:04 - 03:24:04] do compete those under the
[03:24:06 - 03:24:06] jock to be sure they
[03:24:06 - 03:24:09] have the best price of
[03:24:09 - 03:24:09] all the vendors who are
[03:24:09 - 03:24:11] authorized i have a follow-up
[03:24:11 - 03:24:14] question mr mccracken as far
[03:24:14 - 03:24:14] as jock is concerned is
[03:24:17 - 03:24:17] there a reason we don't
[03:24:17 - 03:24:20] directly create our own pool
[03:24:20 - 03:24:20] of jock contractors why is
[03:24:21 - 03:24:21] it that it also goes
[03:24:21 - 03:24:24] through this cooperative purchasing mechanism
[03:24:26 - 03:24:29] in the past uh i
[03:24:29 - 03:24:29] i suppose that we could
[03:24:29 - 03:24:31] um this institution i believe
[03:24:31 - 03:24:31] has done so in the
[03:24:31 - 03:24:32] institution i believe has done
[03:24:32 - 03:24:33] so in the past past
[03:24:35 - 03:24:35] not maybe not recent past
[03:24:35 - 03:24:36] but in the not maybe
[03:24:36 - 03:24:38] not recent past but in
[03:24:39 - 03:24:42] the past yes uh you
[03:24:42 - 03:24:42] correct but not in the
[03:24:42 - 03:24:45] recent past uh i would
[03:24:45 - 03:24:45] say and since maybe tw
[03:24:49 - 03:24:49] before 2017 that is an
[03:24:49 - 03:24:52] option for us to do
[03:24:52 - 03:24:52] our own jock or to
[03:24:52 - 03:24:54] go through the co-op uh
[03:24:54 - 03:24:57] to satisfy that procurement requirement
[03:24:57 - 03:24:59] uh both are acceptable legally
[03:24:59 - 03:24:59] as well i guess my
[03:24:59 - 03:25:02] question is why is to
[03:25:02 - 03:25:02] similar to what my colleagues
[03:25:05 - 03:25:05] are expressing it seems like
[03:25:05 - 03:25:07] we default to co-op even
[03:25:07 - 03:25:09] in the instance of something
[03:25:09 - 03:25:09] like jock and i know
[03:25:09 - 03:25:10] it probably precedes your time
[03:25:10 - 03:25:13] so it's just what we've
[03:25:13 - 03:25:13] always done but in the
[03:25:13 - 03:25:15] in this conversation around how
[03:25:15 - 03:25:16] we improve transparency and have
[03:25:16 - 03:25:20] a better understanding of this
[03:25:20 - 03:25:22] it why aren't we looking
[03:25:22 - 03:25:22] in that direction uh we
[03:25:22 - 03:25:25] we certainly can um one
[03:25:25 - 03:25:29] of the advantages of the
[03:25:29 - 03:25:29] co-op is the volume of
[03:25:29 - 03:25:31] it's essentially a price list
[03:25:31 - 03:25:33] for a type of service
[03:25:33 - 03:25:33] right and so if we
[03:25:33 - 03:25:35] go under our own we're
[03:25:35 - 03:25:35] just going to have to
[03:25:35 - 03:25:37] be very deliberate to think
[03:25:37 - 03:25:39] about every type of service
[03:25:39 - 03:25:41] that we may possibly need
[03:25:41 - 03:25:41] to make sure that we're
[03:25:41 - 03:25:43] costing that out in a
[03:25:43 - 03:25:43] way so that when we
[03:25:43 - 03:25:46] go to make the purchase
[03:25:46 - 03:25:48] there's already a pre-established price
[03:25:48 - 03:25:49] as a ceiling right and
[03:25:49 - 03:25:51] then typically there's a discount
[03:25:51 - 03:25:51] from that price so they
[03:25:51 - 03:25:54] use rs means as kind
[03:25:54 - 03:25:54] of your base cost and
[03:25:54 - 03:25:57] so it can be done
[03:25:57 - 03:25:57] um we would just need
[03:25:57 - 03:25:58] to be very deliberate about
[03:25:58 - 03:26:01] making sure that we capture
[03:26:01 - 03:26:03] things and ultimately what we
[03:26:03 - 03:26:03] would bring to the board
[03:26:03 - 03:26:06] i think in that circumstance
[03:26:06 - 03:26:06] is a list that is
[03:26:07 - 03:26:07] far greater than what we
[03:26:07 - 03:26:11] would actually spend or use
[03:26:11 - 03:26:11] in any given year because
[03:26:13 - 03:26:13] we would have to include
[03:26:13 - 03:26:16] those particular line items in
[03:26:16 - 03:26:18] that cost sheet um but
[03:26:18 - 03:26:20] it can be done sure
[03:26:20 - 03:26:20] and i'd offer this it
[03:26:20 - 03:26:22] it doesn't have to be
[03:26:22 - 03:26:25] an all or nothing doesn't
[03:26:25 - 03:26:25] mean that all jock or
[03:26:25 - 03:26:27] all co-op it's saying 13
[03:26:27 - 03:26:29] million is not an insignificant
[03:26:29 - 03:26:30] number and so that's the
[03:26:32 - 03:26:32] number we're spending in a
[03:26:32 - 03:26:34] year 5 million of that
[03:26:34 - 03:26:37] could plausibly be spent by
[03:26:37 - 03:26:37] a subset of jocks for
[03:26:37 - 03:26:41] certain trades that we predetermine
[03:26:41 - 03:26:43] are more feasible or viable
[03:26:43 - 03:26:43] to go direct uh through
[03:26:43 - 03:26:47] our own jock program versus
[03:26:47 - 03:26:49] hey for the smaller items
[03:26:49 - 03:26:49] that we can't cost out
[03:26:49 - 03:26:51] and don't want to endure
[03:26:51 - 03:26:54] that laborious process of procuring
[03:26:54 - 03:26:56] every one of those then
[03:26:56 - 03:26:56] the co-op might be a
[03:26:56 - 03:26:57] mechanism for then the co-op
[03:26:57 - 03:26:58] might be a mechanism for
[03:26:58 - 03:26:58] it it it absolutely absolutely
[03:27:00 - 03:27:03] okay thank you madam chair
[03:27:03 - 03:27:07] yes madam chair yes um
[03:27:07 - 03:27:07] i i know it's not
[03:27:07 - 03:27:11] always possible but to the
[03:27:11 - 03:27:17] extent we can i would
[03:27:17 - 03:27:17] love to see more of
[03:27:18 - 03:27:21] these items not hinging on
[03:27:21 - 03:27:22] an assumption that we're going
[03:27:22 - 03:27:22] to vote yes or else
[03:27:22 - 03:27:24] we're going to be in
[03:27:24 - 03:27:27] some sort of trouble because
[03:27:27 - 03:27:27] that puts us in an
[03:27:27 - 03:27:30] incredibly difficult position uh with
[03:27:30 - 03:27:32] regard to our fiduciary duty
[03:27:32 - 03:27:35] to the institution i know
[03:27:35 - 03:27:35] it's not always possible and
[03:27:35 - 03:27:37] and i expect that that
[03:27:37 - 03:27:38] it won't be but especially
[03:27:38 - 03:27:40] for these big technology issues
[03:27:40 - 03:27:40] where we know there's been
[03:27:43 - 03:27:43] discussions in the past it
[03:27:43 - 03:27:45] puts us in a real
[03:27:45 - 03:27:45] bind when we get it
[03:27:45 - 03:27:47] it has to be done
[03:27:47 - 03:27:47] or else the institution is
[03:27:47 - 03:27:50] going to some suffer some
[03:27:50 - 03:27:52] sort of repercussions so just
[03:27:52 - 03:27:52] you know i think this
[03:27:52 - 03:27:54] has been kind of a
[03:27:54 - 03:27:54] refrain for the past year
[03:27:54 - 03:27:57] if we could have more
[03:27:57 - 03:27:57] time to see it that
[03:27:59 - 03:27:59] would be wonderful i understand
[03:27:59 - 03:28:01] that it's not always possible
[03:28:01 - 03:28:03] i understand i mean we're
[03:28:03 - 03:28:04] dealing with these huge institution
[03:28:04 - 03:28:04] and a lot of moving
[03:28:04 - 03:28:06] parts especially in this economy
[03:28:06 - 03:28:09] but to the extent we
[03:28:09 - 03:28:09] can i would love to
[03:28:09 - 03:28:12] see there be less negative
[03:28:12 - 03:28:14] repercussions if less of an
[03:28:14 - 03:28:14] assumption that we're going to
[03:28:15 - 03:28:15] that we're going to approve
[03:28:15 - 03:28:16] it or else we're going
[03:28:16 - 03:28:16] to be in some sort
[03:28:16 - 03:28:19] of trouble as an institution
[03:28:19 - 03:28:20] thank you trouble as an
[03:28:21 - 03:28:25] institution thank you yeah oh
[03:28:25 - 03:28:26] it's here i was just
[03:28:26 - 03:28:26] going to make a comment
[03:28:26 - 03:28:29] that okay we are aware
[03:28:29 - 03:28:29] of the fact that you
[03:28:31 - 03:28:31] need a little better reporting
[03:28:31 - 03:28:33] more frequent reporting and slightly
[03:28:35 - 03:28:35] different than what you may
[03:28:35 - 03:28:37] have been receiving i think
[03:28:37 - 03:28:39] what you may have received
[03:28:39 - 03:28:39] over time at least since
[03:28:39 - 03:28:42] i've been here is the
[03:28:42 - 03:28:42] spend on each of the
[03:28:45 - 03:28:45] co-op you know limits but
[03:28:45 - 03:28:48] you don't know what the
[03:28:48 - 03:28:48] balance is you just look
[03:28:50 - 03:28:50] at that one month or
[03:28:50 - 03:28:51] period of time and that's
[03:28:51 - 03:28:51] what the spend is you
[03:28:51 - 03:28:53] don't know whether it's over
[03:28:53 - 03:28:55] under or sideways so we've
[03:28:55 - 03:28:56] now developed a template where
[03:28:58 - 03:28:58] we can capture it by
[03:28:58 - 03:29:01] monthly i think the way
[03:29:01 - 03:29:01] that was expected of us
[03:29:01 - 03:29:02] but i was not aware
[03:29:02 - 03:29:02] of so i apologize for
[03:29:05 - 03:29:05] that um but we're also
[03:29:05 - 03:29:06] considering doing it on a
[03:29:06 - 03:29:08] quarterly basis if that makes
[03:29:08 - 03:29:08] any sense to you and
[03:29:08 - 03:29:10] is acceptable to you we're
[03:29:10 - 03:29:13] capturing the information both ways
[03:29:13 - 03:29:13] in case you do decide
[03:29:13 - 03:29:15] that quarterly is good we
[03:29:15 - 03:29:17] will now provide the whatever
[03:29:17 - 03:29:19] the approved list of vendors
[03:29:19 - 03:29:19] the total amount that has
[03:29:19 - 03:29:22] been approved and the spend
[03:29:22 - 03:29:24] per whatever that period is
[03:29:24 - 03:29:24] that you agree is sufficient
[03:29:26 - 03:29:26] so we're planning to do
[03:29:26 - 03:29:29] that and we're also attempting
[03:29:29 - 03:29:29] to track each of the
[03:29:32 - 03:29:32] spends with each of the
[03:29:32 - 03:29:34] vendors daily so that for
[03:29:34 - 03:29:34] whatever that interim period is
[03:29:37 - 03:29:37] 2 months or 3 months
[03:29:37 - 03:29:39] in case we overrun and
[03:29:39 - 03:29:39] we didn't pay attention quickly
[03:29:41 - 03:29:41] enough we don't want to
[03:29:41 - 03:29:42] have an overrun situation and
[03:29:42 - 03:29:42] so we're being very very
[03:29:44 - 03:29:44] deliberate in planning to look
[03:29:44 - 03:29:46] at it daily we're working
[03:29:46 - 03:29:49] that out now that little
[03:29:49 - 03:29:49] process i also have information
[03:29:53 - 03:29:53] on the actual fy spend
[03:29:53 - 03:29:56] um as of whenever i
[03:29:56 - 03:29:56] pulled it i think august
[03:29:56 - 03:29:58] 18th so if that information
[03:29:58 - 03:29:58] is useful i'd be happy
[03:30:04 - 03:30:08] changing changing you know the
[03:30:08 - 03:30:12] philosophy of purchasing and the
[03:30:12 - 03:30:14] whole um the the whole
[03:30:14 - 03:30:16] procedures in the purchasing department
[03:30:16 - 03:30:18] is incredibly complicated you know
[03:30:18 - 03:30:19] with the jock company you
[03:30:19 - 03:30:19] can patch a hole in
[03:30:19 - 03:30:21] the sheetrock and you only
[03:30:21 - 03:30:24] do it once a month
[03:30:24 - 03:30:24] you know it doesn't pay
[03:30:24 - 03:30:26] to have somebody on your
[03:30:26 - 03:30:29] staff who's a sheetrock hanger
[03:30:29 - 03:30:29] and someone who can float
[03:30:29 - 03:30:34] and someone who can paint
[03:30:34 - 03:30:36] it and having it the
[03:30:36 - 03:30:36] balance for when you need
[03:30:36 - 03:30:39] to use a jock contractor
[03:30:39 - 03:30:39] or when we need to
[03:30:39 - 03:30:42] use the cooperative or when
[03:30:42 - 03:30:45] we need to go and
[03:30:45 - 03:30:45] bid out bigger items and
[03:30:45 - 03:30:48] you know depend upon you
[03:30:48 - 03:30:48] know all of this creates
[03:30:52 - 03:30:52] work and sometimes if we
[03:30:52 - 03:30:55] decide to do all the
[03:30:55 - 03:30:55] work ourselves in house it's
[03:30:58 - 03:30:58] going to balloon the cost
[03:30:58 - 03:31:01] i'm afraid so you know
[03:31:01 - 03:31:01] it's it's when you get
[03:31:03 - 03:31:07] into this whole discussion we're
[03:31:07 - 03:31:10] now having it's kind of
[03:31:10 - 03:31:13] like opening pandora's box and
[03:31:13 - 03:31:13] and what we're doing but
[03:31:13 - 03:31:16] to me i would like
[03:31:16 - 03:31:16] to focus more on procedures
[03:31:21 - 03:31:21] on how we do and
[03:31:21 - 03:31:23] assign things to is this
[03:31:23 - 03:31:23] something we're going to bid
[03:31:23 - 03:31:25] out or is this something
[03:31:25 - 03:31:28] that's cooperative or is this
[03:31:28 - 03:31:28] a jock contract thing we
[03:31:28 - 03:31:30] should give the purchasing department
[03:31:33 - 03:31:33] uh with and you know
[03:31:33 - 03:31:33] and keep in mind if
[03:31:35 - 03:31:35] the more they do themselves
[03:31:35 - 03:31:37] the more personnel they're going
[03:31:37 - 03:31:41] to have to have more
[03:31:41 - 03:31:41] people uh um project managing
[03:31:41 - 03:31:47] jobs etc etc so this
[03:31:47 - 03:31:47] is a um a bigger
[03:31:47 - 03:31:49] than we think discussion that
[03:31:49 - 03:31:51] we're getting into and you
[03:31:51 - 03:31:55] know most major corporations have
[03:31:55 - 03:31:57] a tdi industries out there
[03:31:57 - 03:31:58] doing their work and most
[03:32:00 - 03:32:00] corporations they they use jock
[03:32:02 - 03:32:02] contractors who people have been
[03:32:05 - 03:32:05] qualified and are insured uh
[03:32:05 - 03:32:08] etc etc so none of
[03:32:08 - 03:32:08] this is unusual that uh
[03:32:14 - 03:32:14] houston city college is doing
[03:32:14 - 03:32:19] but u it's and and
[03:32:19 - 03:32:19] then the role of the
[03:32:19 - 03:32:23] board is uh to set
[03:32:23 - 03:32:23] policy and i don't want
[03:32:23 - 03:32:26] to get into well it
[03:32:26 - 03:32:26] would have been cheaper if
[03:32:29 - 03:32:29] we'd have had a sheetrock
[03:32:31 - 03:32:31] company come in and fix
[03:32:31 - 03:32:33] that wall or have a
[03:32:33 - 03:32:33] jock contractor and do it
[03:32:33 - 03:32:36] in house we we as
[03:32:36 - 03:32:36] a board don't need to
[03:32:38 - 03:32:38] get in that we need
[03:32:38 - 03:32:40] to be setting policy on
[03:32:40 - 03:32:40] how we do the procurement
[03:32:40 - 03:32:43] and that and leave it
[03:32:43 - 03:32:44] up to the purchasing and
[03:32:44 - 03:32:44] if we don't like the
[03:32:44 - 03:32:46] purchasing department and they're not
[03:32:46 - 03:32:48] doing right and getting us
[03:32:48 - 03:32:48] the best we need to
[03:32:49 - 03:32:49] replace them or the chancellor
[03:32:49 - 03:32:51] needs to replace them you
[03:32:51 - 03:32:53] know that's more of the
[03:32:53 - 03:32:53] oversight of this board what
[03:32:53 - 03:32:56] i think we should be
[03:32:56 - 03:32:58] looking at but this this
[03:32:58 - 03:32:58] is a good discussion to
[03:32:58 - 03:33:00] the board thank you thank
[03:33:00 - 03:33:04] you okay okay madam chair
[03:33:04 - 03:33:04] i'd like to make a
[03:33:04 - 03:33:08] motion um i move to
[03:33:08 - 03:33:08] divide the question with um
[03:33:08 - 03:33:09] i move to divide the
[03:33:09 - 03:33:11] question with telecommunications telecommunications year
[03:33:11 - 03:33:12] one of the canvas learning
[03:33:14 - 03:33:14] management system and a million
[03:33:14 - 03:33:17] dollars in uh staffing services
[03:33:17 - 03:33:21] as one question for a
[03:33:21 - 03:33:21] total of 2 442 million
[03:33:21 - 03:33:23] and the balance of the
[03:33:23 - 03:33:23] item in the other and
[03:33:23 - 03:33:38] i yes i'll second yeah
[03:33:38 - 03:33:38] okay so it's been moved
[03:33:38 - 03:33:40] and seconded so and then
[03:33:40 - 03:33:40] i can explain what i
[03:33:40 - 03:33:42] just asked did it again
[03:33:42 - 03:33:44] so sharing yep so the
[03:33:44 - 03:33:44] the amendment is to divide
[03:33:47 - 03:33:47] the question where question number
[03:33:47 - 03:33:49] one would include this funding
[03:33:49 - 03:33:50] request for would include this
[03:33:50 - 03:33:51] funding request for telecommunications telecommunications
[03:33:54 - 03:33:54] year one of the canvas
[03:33:54 - 03:33:57] learning management system and a
[03:33:57 - 03:34:02] million dollars in staffing services
[03:34:02 - 03:34:07] funding for a total uh
[03:34:07 - 03:34:07] cost of 2 442 million
[03:34:09 - 03:34:09] and then the second question
[03:34:09 - 03:34:11] would be the approval of
[03:34:11 - 03:34:16] the balance of the question
[03:34:18 - 03:34:20] question on the staff and
[03:34:20 - 03:34:22] services how did is was
[03:34:22 - 03:34:29] 1 million just and the
[03:34:29 - 03:34:29] assumption is that we'll come
[03:34:30 - 03:34:30] back in a month and
[03:34:30 - 03:34:34] talk about the second bucket
[03:34:34 - 03:34:34] um hope so we can
[03:34:34 - 03:34:35] have all the information that
[03:34:35 - 03:34:42] we need to make i
[03:34:42 - 03:34:42] guess my other question follow
[03:34:42 - 03:34:47] up is is is there
[03:34:47 - 03:34:48] are are there dr dr
[03:34:48 - 03:34:50] montgomery you brought up staffing
[03:34:50 - 03:34:50] services and i just want
[03:34:50 - 03:34:51] to trust the chief are
[03:34:51 - 03:34:54] there any other misgivings about
[03:34:54 - 03:34:57] that category or is that
[03:34:57 - 03:34:57] like do we just add
[03:34:57 - 03:35:00] that category with the you
[03:35:00 - 03:35:00] see how we kind of
[03:35:00 - 03:35:03] to tell the communications as
[03:35:03 - 03:35:05] one and then could we
[03:35:05 - 03:35:08] also just take staffing as
[03:35:08 - 03:35:08] a whole category i'm just
[03:35:08 - 03:35:10] wondering do we really if
[03:35:10 - 03:35:12] if there's misgivings for sure
[03:35:12 - 03:35:12] but just that was just
[03:35:12 - 03:35:14] a thought but yeah open
[03:35:14 - 03:35:14] open to amendments to the
[03:35:14 - 03:35:16] yeah open open to amendments
[03:35:17 - 03:35:28] to the amendment that's that's
[03:35:28 - 03:35:30] the that's the amendment that's
[03:35:30 - 03:35:34] been made and seconded so
[03:35:34 - 03:35:36] then can i speak to
[03:35:36 - 03:35:39] my intent here really quickly
[03:35:39 - 03:35:39] so so the intent is
[03:35:39 - 03:35:41] now that it's separated into
[03:35:41 - 03:35:42] two um we've taken the
[03:35:42 - 03:35:42] items that it's been expressed
[03:35:42 - 03:35:44] by staff that there's urgency
[03:35:44 - 03:35:47] to approve right now those
[03:35:47 - 03:35:49] are bucketed into one item
[03:35:49 - 03:35:49] that we can approve tonight
[03:35:49 - 03:35:52] the other item we can
[03:35:52 - 03:35:54] postpone until next meeting so
[03:35:54 - 03:35:54] we have time to receive
[03:35:54 - 03:35:56] the information um and talk
[03:35:56 - 03:35:58] about transparency and and how
[03:35:58 - 03:35:59] we're going to move forward
[03:35:59 - 03:35:59] and we can approve it
[03:35:59 - 03:36:01] next month that's the intent
[03:36:01 - 03:36:07] with separating the question um
[03:36:07 - 03:36:07] my recommendation um madam chair
[03:36:09 - 03:36:09] trustees would be to take
[03:36:09 - 03:36:11] the full amount of the
[03:36:11 - 03:36:12] staffing because we're dealing with
[03:36:12 - 03:36:15] staffing personnel and expertise we
[03:36:15 - 03:36:18] typically for those positions offer
[03:36:18 - 03:36:20] the full fiscy year appointment
[03:36:20 - 03:36:20] so by authorizing only a
[03:36:23 - 03:36:23] portion of it then i
[03:36:23 - 03:36:24] would hate to put the
[03:36:24 - 03:36:24] college in a situation where
[03:36:28 - 03:36:28] critical staffing resources um would
[03:36:28 - 03:36:30] be difficult to keep those
[03:36:30 - 03:36:32] individuals that's my only point
[03:36:32 - 03:36:34] so with that trust achiever
[03:36:34 - 03:36:34] would you be open to
[03:36:34 - 03:36:37] an amendment to the amendment
[03:36:37 - 03:36:41] that increases the number from
[03:36:41 - 03:36:44] 2 442 million to 5
[03:36:44 - 03:36:47] 642 million by doing that
[03:36:47 - 03:36:50] you taking the full staffing
[03:36:50 - 03:36:53] services amount and the telecommunications
[03:36:53 - 03:36:55] and fy26 for the canvas
[03:36:55 - 03:36:55] learning management for the canvas
[03:36:56 - 03:36:58] learning management system system i

[03:43:26 - 03:43:30] uh every laptop um and
[03:43:30 - 03:43:30] every roll of toilet paper
[03:43:30 - 03:43:32] that we're going to allow
[03:43:32 - 03:43:36] the administration to buy i
[03:43:36 - 03:43:36] think we're getting on shaky
[03:43:36 - 03:43:43] ground you know we need
[03:43:43 - 03:43:45] to be looking at policy
[03:43:45 - 03:43:47] rather than line items on
[03:43:47 - 03:43:47] that i'm not saying we
[03:43:49 - 03:43:49] should there shouldn't be account
[03:43:49 - 03:43:51] there shouldn't be accountability and
[03:43:51 - 03:43:52] we shouldn't have a good
[03:43:52 - 03:43:54] explanation for all that but
[03:43:54 - 03:43:57] i'm just a little concerned
[03:43:57 - 03:44:01] that we're thank you noted
[03:44:01 - 03:44:04] madam chair i while i
[03:44:04 - 03:44:07] appreciate that statement from the
[03:44:07 - 03:44:10] audit committee perspective this is
[03:44:10 - 03:44:10] an issue there was a
[03:44:10 - 03:44:12] different discussion and now we're
[03:44:12 - 03:44:15] looking at a different budget
[03:44:15 - 03:44:15] so what i want to
[03:44:15 - 03:44:17] see and what this audit
[03:44:17 - 03:44:21] committee agreed to look at
[03:44:21 - 03:44:21] is not what we're seeing
[03:44:21 - 03:44:23] now so it's not so
[03:44:23 - 03:44:23] much the question of each
[03:44:26 - 03:44:26] individual line item i brought
[03:44:26 - 03:44:28] that up because there was
[03:44:28 - 03:44:28] a discussion and an because
[03:44:29 - 03:44:30] there was a discussion and
[03:44:30 - 03:44:35] an explanation explanation and now
[03:44:35 - 03:44:35] that explanation based on this
[03:44:37 - 03:44:37] would have been different so
[03:44:37 - 03:44:39] we will go back to
[03:44:39 - 03:44:39] the audit committee and the
[03:44:42 - 03:44:42] presentation and we will go
[03:44:42 - 03:44:45] through what the presentation was
[03:44:45 - 03:44:48] in addition to the oracle
[03:44:48 - 03:44:48] issues which were not part
[03:44:48 - 03:44:50] of the presentation so that
[03:44:50 - 03:44:53] we make sure that we
[03:44:53 - 03:44:53] are we are we are
[03:44:53 - 03:44:56] spending in a fiscally responsible
[03:44:56 - 03:45:01] manner not so much the
[03:45:01 - 03:45:01] 125 000 for the laptops
[03:45:01 - 03:45:03] and the 5 million for
[03:45:03 - 03:45:07] teacher laptops or instructor laptops
[03:45:07 - 03:45:07] uh versus 125 000 for
[03:45:12 - 03:45:12] student laptops that's a pebble
[03:45:12 - 03:45:16] concern concerning the rest of
[03:45:16 - 03:45:18] the it issue we have
[03:45:18 - 03:45:21] consistently been asked to approve
[03:45:21 - 03:45:24] make blanket approvals at 15
[03:45:24 - 03:45:27] million and then come back
[03:45:27 - 03:45:27] and ask for more money
[03:45:27 - 03:45:30] out of fund balance mid
[03:45:30 - 03:45:30] year so we we want
[03:45:30 - 03:45:33] to make sure that whatever
[03:45:33 - 03:45:37] we've asked for now we
[03:45:37 - 03:45:37] don't ask for more later
[03:45:37 - 03:45:39] so audit committee needs to
[03:45:39 - 03:45:41] have a clear understanding with
[03:45:41 - 03:45:44] a better uh presentation so
[03:45:44 - 03:45:48] i appreciate what you said
[03:45:48 - 03:45:49] but i'm not nitpicking i'm
[03:45:49 - 03:45:51] nitpicking for a completely different
[03:45:52 - 03:45:58] reason trusty trusty patterson in

[03:52:10 - 03:52:12] authorization to also submit a
[03:52:12 - 03:52:12] report to the texas higher

[03:52:19 - 03:52:25] code section 51 942 this
[03:52:25 - 03:52:25] report is regarding policies of
[03:52:26 - 03:52:26] tenure and employment of faculty
[03:52:26 - 03:52:29] members at the college as
[03:52:29 - 03:52:30] the chancellor said although the
[03:52:30 - 03:52:32] college does not have tenure
[03:52:32 - 03:52:32] for the faculty the coordinating
[03:52:34 - 03:52:34] board would like for junior
[03:52:34 - 03:52:36] colleges to have a report
[03:52:36 - 03:52:36] on file indicating that we
[03:52:39 - 03:52:39] do not have tenure at
[03:52:39 - 03:52:41] our institution and thus we're
[03:52:41 - 03:52:43] in compliance with cable 18

[03:52:43 - 03:52:45] to sign the report and
[03:52:45 - 03:52:45] as i said earlier the

[03:52:51 - 03:52:51] in your packet is the

[03:57:53 - 03:57:53] meant a lot to several
[03:57:53 - 03:57:55] of us on this board
[03:57:55 - 03:57:56] and she was an incredibly
[03:57:59 - 03:57:59] important teacher to me even
[03:57:59 - 03:58:02] though i never saw her
[03:58:02 - 03:58:02] in a classroom and i
[03:58:03 - 03:58:03] didn't meet her till i
[03:58:03 - 03:58:06] was well in my 30s
[03:58:06 - 03:58:09] but she worked so hard
[03:58:09 - 03:58:09] for so many years to
[03:58:12 - 03:58:12] make sure our community had
[03:58:12 - 03:58:13] a voice to support some
[03:58:13 - 03:58:17] incredibly important people she i
[03:58:17 - 03:58:17] mean she would do so
[03:58:17 - 03:58:20] much from educating parents on
[03:58:20 - 03:58:23] how to make meetings with
[03:58:23 - 03:58:25] principles so they could talk
[03:58:25 - 03:58:27] about their children's educations she
[03:58:27 - 03:58:27] would do that she would
[03:58:27 - 03:58:29] volunteer to do that and
[03:58:29 - 03:58:31] she made a difference every
[03:58:31 - 03:58:31] single time she took her
[03:58:31 - 03:58:34] jeff davis students at the
[03:58:34 - 03:58:38] time downtown to see their
[03:58:38 - 03:58:38] first show uh and and
[03:58:38 - 03:58:40] i remember her her telling
[03:58:40 - 03:58:42] the story of entering into
[03:58:42 - 03:58:42] the bathroom and one of
[03:58:43 - 03:58:43] the girls was just staring
[03:58:43 - 03:58:45] at this machine cuz she
[03:58:45 - 03:58:45] had never seen a hand
[03:58:47 - 03:58:47] drying machine before cuz she'd
[03:58:47 - 03:58:49] never been outside of her
[03:58:49 - 03:58:52] neighborhood she made such an
[03:58:52 - 03:58:56] incredible difference and she will
[03:58:56 - 03:58:56] be very missed so pardon
[03:58:58 - 03:59:00] the tears but um it's
[03:59:00 - 03:59:00] a huge loss she it's
[03:59:00 - 03:59:02] a huge loss to our
[03:59:02 - 03:59:04] community especially when we're facing
[03:59:04 - 03:59:04] so much hatred and so
[03:59:04 - 03:59:07] much minimization and uh in
[03:59:07 - 03:59:09] so many of our underserved
[03:59:09 - 03:59:12] communities and i'm just grateful
[03:59:12 - 03:59:12] to have met her and
[03:59:12 - 03:59:15] that she had such a
[03:59:15 - 03:59:15] big role in in so
[03:59:15 - 03:59:18] many of our lives so
[03:59:18 - 03:59:20] that's it thank you i
[03:59:20 - 03:59:20] as well um had the
[03:59:22 - 03:59:22] opportunity to work with her

[03:59:25 - 03:59:29] and the schools and um
[03:59:29 - 03:59:29] and yeah she really gave
[03:59:29 - 03:59:31] a lot to students and
[03:59:31 - 03:59:31] wanted to make sure that
[03:59:34 - 03:59:34] they were successful and uh
[03:59:34 - 03:59:36] always instilled in them that
[03:59:36 - 03:59:39] whatever they dreamed it could
[03:59:39 - 03:59:39] happen and so she made
[03:59:41 - 03:59:41] sure she worked with getting
[03:59:41 - 03:59:44] them scholarships and opportunities to
[03:59:44 - 03:59:46] uh to go to college
[03:59:46 - 03:59:46] and the beauty of it

[04:02:49 - 04:02:51] of the chancellor's executive council
[04:02:51 - 04:02:51] under the leadership of the
[04:02:53 - 04:02:54] chancellor the hcc foundation shifted
[04:02:56 - 04:02:56] for when the scholarship is
[04:02:56 - 04:02:58] open and when it closes
[04:02:58 - 04:02:58] and we are now open
[04:02:58 - 04:03:01] from july 15th through february
[04:03:01 - 04:03:04] 2nd as opposed to in
[04:03:04 - 04:03:04] the early part of the
[04:03:08 - 04:03:08] year january 15th to the
[04:03:08 - 04:03:12] end of june last year
[04:03:12 - 04:03:15] fiscal year 2024 and 2025
[04:03:15 - 04:03:15] in total the number of
[04:03:19 - 04:03:19] applications for scholarships was 2
[04:03:19 - 04:03:23] 400 and some change as
[04:03:23 - 04:03:27] of last friday it was
[04:03:27 - 04:03:31] 9 256 for just so
[04:03:31 - 04:03:31] far within fiscal year 25
[04:03:31 - 04:03:33] for just so far within
[04:03:34 - 04:03:39] fiscal year 25 so i
[04:03:39 - 04:03:39] just want to say a
[04:03:39 - 04:03:42] thank you to people who
[04:03:42 - 04:03:42] you don't get to see
[04:03:42 - 04:03:46] very much and that is
[04:03:46 - 04:03:50] our very hardworking dedicated scholarship
[04:03:50 - 04:03:53] team felicia brooks simone muhammad
[04:03:53 - 04:03:53] and sophia lopez who have
[04:03:56 - 04:03:56] done an awesome job and
[04:03:56 - 04:03:58] what they're saying right now
[04:03:58 - 04:03:58] is that with 9 000
[04:04:00 - 04:04:00] scholarships they just want to
[04:04:00 - 04:04:02] be offering awarding offering awarding
[04:04:05 - 04:04:05] offering awarding um and it
[04:04:05 - 04:04:07] is very it's a very
[04:04:07 - 04:04:07] exciting time to have that
[04:04:09 - 04:04:09] kind of volume change we
[04:04:09 - 04:04:11] also have increased the amount
[04:04:11 - 04:04:13] of promotions that we're doing
[04:04:13 - 04:04:16] for um foundation scholarships under
[04:04:16 - 04:04:19] the leadership of the chancellor
[04:04:19 - 04:04:19] where we've shown up it
[04:04:20 - 04:04:20] seems obvious but we've been
[04:04:20 - 04:04:22] at registration fairs we've been
[04:04:22 - 04:04:25] on the monitors at the
[04:04:25 - 04:04:27] campuses we've provided flyers and
[04:04:27 - 04:04:28] we've been very aggressive in
[04:04:30 - 04:04:30] our social media in terms
[04:04:30 - 04:04:34] of posting in social media
[04:04:34 - 04:04:34] we also think that it
[04:04:34 - 04:04:38] is also that is the
[04:04:38 - 04:04:38] increase but it is also
[04:04:40 - 04:04:40] something that we want to
[04:04:40 - 04:04:43] look into over this next
[04:04:43 - 04:04:45] year with financial aid because
[04:04:45 - 04:04:45] we think that we're getting
[04:04:49 - 04:04:49] increased volume but this is
[04:04:49 - 04:04:51] quadrupled you know for the
[04:04:51 - 04:04:51] time and i think it's
[04:04:53 - 04:04:53] also got something to do
[04:04:53 - 04:04:56] with the times that we're
[04:04:56 - 04:04:56] in but the hcc foundation
[04:04:56 - 04:04:59] is honored to have the
[04:04:59 - 04:05:02] opportunity to do this the
[04:05:02 - 04:05:02] other thing that we want
[04:05:02 - 04:05:06] to let you all know
[04:05:06 - 04:05:06] is that we have a
[04:05:06 - 04:05:10] 15 million endowment we normally
[04:05:10 - 04:05:13] authorize spending in the range
[04:05:13 - 04:05:15] of 4 this year's authorized
[04:05:15 - 04:05:18] spending because the markets have
[04:05:18 - 04:05:18] done well because of the
[04:05:18 - 04:05:21] need for scholarships at hcc
[04:05:21 - 04:05:25] the amount of the authorization
[04:05:25 - 04:05:26] was upped to 5 25
[04:05:28 - 04:05:28] which was an increase of
[04:05:28 - 04:05:31] 250 000 so there's over
[04:05:31 - 04:05:33] 2 million that is available
[04:05:33 - 04:05:33] to be able to award
[04:05:33 - 04:05:36] for scholarships just through the
[04:05:36 - 04:05:38] hcc foundation and it's an
[04:05:38 - 04:05:39] honor and a foundation and
[04:05:39 - 04:05:40] it's an honor and a
[04:05:40 - 04:05:42] privilege privilege thank you very

[04:06:58 - 04:06:58] evening thank you again um
[04:06:58 - 04:07:00] so this is an item
[04:07:00 - 04:07:00] that we used to present
[04:07:02 - 04:07:02] to the board on a
[04:07:02 - 04:07:04] regular basis and then we
[04:07:04 - 04:07:04] had a hiatus with it
[04:07:04 - 04:07:06] we are we are bringing
[04:07:06 - 04:07:06] this back our intent is
[04:07:06 - 04:07:09] to provide it uh on
[04:07:09 - 04:07:11] a quarterly basis moving forward
[04:07:11 - 04:07:12] uh where we're just reviewing
[04:07:12 - 04:07:14] those capital improvement projects and
[04:07:14 - 04:07:16] major projects that are happening
[04:07:16 - 04:07:16] to keep the board apprised
[04:07:16 - 04:07:18] of the status of these
[04:07:18 - 04:07:20] these projects are not funded
[04:07:20 - 04:07:23] out of operating budget these
[04:07:23 - 04:07:23] are out of the the
[04:07:23 - 04:07:24] fund 7 budget which means
[04:07:24 - 04:07:24] that these are multi-year which
[04:07:25 - 04:07:26] means that these are multi-year
[04:07:26 - 04:07:29] projects projects um and so
[04:07:29 - 04:07:29] i'm just going to highlight
[04:07:29 - 04:07:31] a couple of items in
[04:07:31 - 04:07:32] here i'm not going to
[04:07:32 - 04:07:32] walk through the entire report
[04:07:32 - 04:07:33] what we're trying to do
[04:07:33 - 04:07:33] is a little bit more
[04:07:35 - 04:07:35] of a project management approach
[04:07:35 - 04:07:37] to this and so we're
[04:07:37 - 04:07:39] rating the projects in terms
[04:07:39 - 04:07:39] of at risk caution or
[04:07:39 - 04:07:43] on track and then um
[04:07:43 - 04:07:46] we're also just green means
[04:07:46 - 04:07:46] on track a check mark
[04:07:46 - 04:07:48] means done um and so
[04:07:48 - 04:07:48] if we just talk about
[04:07:48 - 04:07:50] the central culinary buildout you
[04:07:50 - 04:07:52] see that all of the
[04:07:52 - 04:07:52] work and construction is done
[04:07:54 - 04:07:54] and it's completed it opened
[04:07:54 - 04:07:58] in january of 25 for
[04:07:58 - 04:08:00] the spring semester classes close
[04:08:00 - 04:08:00] out is highlighted in yellow
[04:08:03 - 04:08:03] because there's a concern about
[04:08:03 - 04:08:05] budget as we were doing
[04:08:05 - 04:08:07] that final close out we
[04:08:07 - 04:08:07] have to reconcile all of
[04:08:07 - 04:08:09] the final invoices and we
[04:08:09 - 04:08:09] have to look at all
[04:08:09 - 04:08:10] of the change orders to
[04:08:10 - 04:08:12] make sure that everything matches
[04:08:12 - 04:08:12] up so that we're only
[04:08:13 - 04:08:13] paying for things that we
[04:08:13 - 04:08:15] should be paying for there's
[04:08:15 - 04:08:17] a possibility on this one
[04:08:17 - 04:08:17] that we may end up
[04:08:17 - 04:08:19] being slightly over budget in
[04:08:19 - 04:08:20] which case we're going to
[04:08:20 - 04:08:20] have to find some funds
[04:08:22 - 04:08:22] on the other side but
[04:08:22 - 04:08:24] the total amount of that
[04:08:24 - 04:08:24] is roughly a h 100
[04:08:24 - 04:08:26] 000 we think but we're
[04:08:26 - 04:08:29] continuing to work on that
[04:08:29 - 04:08:29] so that's why that's yellow
[04:08:29 - 04:08:30] um these are some pictures
[04:08:30 - 04:08:34] of that space it's beautiful
[04:08:34 - 04:08:36] space heavily used all right
[04:08:36 - 04:08:38] um safety and security door
[04:08:38 - 04:08:40] hardware project has been completed
[04:08:40 - 04:08:42] we are in the closeout
[04:08:42 - 04:08:44] phase now we're processing final
[04:08:44 - 04:08:44] invoices that project is is
[04:08:48 - 04:08:48] wrapped up and um what
[04:08:48 - 04:08:49] you see here are just
[04:08:49 - 04:08:49] some examples of the different
[04:08:50 - 04:08:50] types of locks on different
[04:08:50 - 04:08:52] types of doors some of
[04:08:52 - 04:08:55] these were really tricky to
[04:08:55 - 04:08:55] do like a push button
[04:08:55 - 04:08:56] push bar door you have
[04:08:56 - 04:08:56] to be able to exit
[04:08:56 - 04:08:59] through that that's a fire
[04:08:59 - 04:08:59] exit um and so you
[04:09:01 - 04:09:01] see different types of of
[04:09:01 - 04:09:04] mechanisms that were installed on
[04:09:04 - 04:09:06] those um this is woodridge
[04:09:06 - 04:09:06] what we want it to
[04:09:08 - 04:09:08] look like when we're all
[04:09:08 - 04:09:11] said and done um this
[04:09:11 - 04:09:11] is actually two projects that
[04:09:11 - 04:09:13] we have the demolition is
[04:09:13 - 04:09:14] completed and has been closed
[04:09:14 - 04:09:16] out that's the column on
[04:09:16 - 04:09:16] the right the column on
[04:09:16 - 04:09:18] the left is the view
[04:09:18 - 04:09:18] corridor where we are trying
[04:09:18 - 04:09:21] to get to the the
[04:09:21 - 04:09:21] green grass that you can
[04:09:23 - 04:09:23] see um you can see
[04:09:23 - 04:09:25] the footprint here kind of
[04:09:25 - 04:09:25] the squiggle line through there
[04:09:27 - 04:09:27] that is a very large
[04:09:27 - 04:09:29] footprint um that was after
[04:09:29 - 04:09:29] the building was taken down
[04:09:31 - 04:09:31] but before the foundation was
[04:09:31 - 04:09:33] removed um this is after
[04:09:33 - 04:09:36] that foundation was removed and
[04:09:36 - 04:09:36] it was graded um and
[04:09:36 - 04:09:37] so we're working on getting
[04:09:37 - 04:09:39] the grass planted so we
[04:09:39 - 04:09:41] have greenery uh safety and
[04:09:41 - 04:09:41] security access control this is
[04:09:43 - 04:09:43] largely infrastructure stuff behind the
[04:09:46 - 04:09:46] scenes to plug in um
[04:09:46 - 04:09:48] this project has um completed
[04:09:48 - 04:09:50] a procurement process but it's
[04:09:50 - 04:09:53] under construction yes ma'am yes
[04:09:53 - 04:09:53] uh excuse me what's the
[04:09:53 - 04:10:09] timeline september 20th okay thank
[04:10:09 - 04:10:11] you north forest collaboratorium i
[04:10:11 - 04:10:13] just want to touch base
[04:10:13 - 04:10:13] on um so this project
[04:10:15 - 04:10:15] has been in design for
[04:10:15 - 04:10:17] a while there was some
[04:10:17 - 04:10:17] concerns around budget we just
[04:10:19 - 04:10:19] got back in the last
[04:10:19 - 04:10:22] week um some updated um
[04:10:22 - 04:10:25] proposals that are we're going
[04:10:25 - 04:10:25] to be able to remain
[04:10:25 - 04:10:26] in budget on this and
[04:10:26 - 04:10:26] we should be able to
[04:10:26 - 04:10:28] kick this project the construction
[04:10:28 - 04:10:32] portion off in october um
[04:10:32 - 04:10:32] there's some kind of visuals
[04:10:35 - 04:10:35] of that space uh the
[04:10:35 - 04:10:36] other ones i'm going to
[04:10:36 - 04:10:36] kind of skip over at
[04:10:36 - 04:10:38] the very end is some
[04:10:38 - 04:10:41] deferred maintenance project status report
[04:10:41 - 04:10:43] just very basic numbers there
[04:10:43 - 04:10:43] is a audit committee report
[04:10:43 - 04:10:45] on deferred maintenance scheduled for
[04:10:46 - 04:10:47] uh the september meeting that
[04:10:47 - 04:10:50] will have more detail on
[04:10:50 - 04:10:52] deferred maintenance be happy to
[04:10:52 - 04:10:56] answer any questions trustees any
[04:10:56 - 04:10:58] questions trusty sheen one quick
[04:10:58 - 04:10:58] one um so on the
[04:10:58 - 04:11:00] view quarter i know that
[04:11:00 - 04:11:01] the actual cost ended up
[04:11:01 - 04:11:02] come ended up coming in
[04:11:03 - 04:11:03] dramatically lower than the original
[04:11:05 - 04:11:05] estimate and we don't have
[04:11:05 - 04:11:06] to dig into it now
[04:11:06 - 04:11:06] i'm just curious the next
[04:11:06 - 04:11:08] time this report comes back
[04:11:08 - 04:11:10] it would be helpful to
[04:11:10 - 04:11:12] understand what that actual versus
[04:11:12 - 04:11:12] budget looks like and then
[04:11:12 - 04:11:14] i i would expect that
[04:11:14 - 04:11:16] there's a significant surplus associated
[04:11:16 - 04:11:16] or in in the account
[04:11:19 - 04:11:19] associated with this project and
[04:11:19 - 04:11:20] how that gets either reallocated
[04:11:20 - 04:11:22] back to the general fund
[04:11:22 - 04:11:24] or reallocated to deferred maintenance
[04:11:24 - 04:11:25] just be understand to understand
[04:11:25 - 04:11:27] how you know some transparency
[04:11:27 - 04:11:27] around how that i think
[04:11:29 - 04:11:29] 3ish million will be reallocated
[04:11:29 - 04:11:32] to other stuff sure and
[04:11:32 - 04:11:32] if you look at slide
[04:11:32 - 04:11:34] five um this is the
[04:11:34 - 04:11:35] budget status of those items
[04:11:35 - 04:11:35] so you have the original
[04:11:36 - 04:11:38] budget the amount that was
[04:11:38 - 04:11:40] expended um the amount that's
[04:11:40 - 04:11:41] encumbered which is means that
[04:11:41 - 04:11:41] we have a purchase order
[04:11:41 - 04:11:43] out there but we haven't
[04:11:43 - 04:11:45] actually invoiced and spent it
[04:11:45 - 04:11:45] yet and then the unexpended
[04:11:47 - 04:11:47] so that unexpended column is
[04:11:47 - 04:11:49] the amounts that you're seeing
[04:11:49 - 04:11:51] we cannot just move money
[04:11:51 - 04:11:51] from one line item to
[04:11:51 - 04:11:53] another on these items because
[04:11:53 - 04:11:56] these were bond projects um
[04:11:56 - 04:11:56] and so before we move
[04:11:56 - 04:11:57] any money between these lines
[04:11:57 - 04:11:58] we have to come back
[04:11:58 - 04:11:58] to the board for come
[04:11:58 - 04:11:59] back to the board for
[04:12:00 - 04:12:05] reauthorization reauthorization with no further
[04:12:05 - 04:12:08] business coming before the board
[04:12:08 - 04:12:08] this meeting of the hcc
[04:12:08 - 04:12:11] board of trustees is hereby
[04:12:11 - 04:12:12] adjourned at 7 00 p
[04:12:12 - 04:12:17] m okay
