[00:58:26 - 00:58:28] to continue on from an
[00:58:28 - 00:58:30] associates workforce credential and onto
[00:58:30 - 00:58:30] a bachelor's degree in the
[00:58:33 - 00:58:33] workforce bachelor's degree field if
[00:58:35 - 00:58:35] the bachelor's degree is not
[00:58:35 - 00:58:38] available through hcc then our
[00:58:38 - 00:58:40] associate degree completers may then

[00:58:43 - 00:58:43] community college for the final
[00:58:45 - 00:58:45] two years if the balory
[00:58:45 - 00:58:47] degree is available at their

[00:59:29 - 00:59:31] chancellor today we're here to
[00:59:31 - 00:59:33] present a more detailed report
[00:59:33 - 00:59:37] on the significant three new
[00:59:37 - 00:59:37] proposed bak balari degrees being
[00:59:37 - 00:59:39] new proposed bak balari degrees
[00:59:39 - 00:59:41] being considered considered if you
[00:59:41 - 00:59:41] have attended any of the
[00:59:43 - 00:59:43] community partnership events being held
[00:59:46 - 00:59:46] at each of our colleges
[00:59:46 - 00:59:48] you heard hcc has identified
[00:59:48 - 00:59:51] three areas of focus nursing
[00:59:51 - 00:59:53] computer information systems and business
[00:59:53 - 00:59:57] for potential baloria degrees uh
[00:59:57 - 01:00:00] development i shared the same
[01:00:00 - 01:00:00] um that these areas of
[01:00:00 - 01:00:02] focus at the uh board
[01:00:02 - 01:00:02] of trustees meeting held on
[01:00:05 - 01:00:07] june the 18th 2025 described
[01:00:07 - 01:00:07] that at the time as
[01:00:07 - 01:00:09] nursing computer science and business
[01:00:12 - 01:00:12] management the next step in
[01:00:12 - 01:00:14] the process is collecting feedback
[01:00:14 - 01:00:17] and perspectives from stakeholders to
[01:00:17 - 01:00:20] provide guidance and context for
[01:00:20 - 01:00:22] program development over the next
[01:00:22 - 01:00:24] year each of these program
[01:00:24 - 01:00:24] areas will engage in deep
[01:00:26 - 01:00:26] conversations about the design of
[01:00:26 - 01:00:31] each degree plan including curriculum
[01:00:33 - 01:00:33] potential specialization tracks as well
[01:00:37 - 01:00:37] as faculty needs and budgetary
[01:00:37 - 01:00:39] needs the goal would be
[01:00:39 - 01:00:43] to present at least one
[01:00:43 - 01:00:43] if not two fully articulated
[01:00:43 - 01:00:46] new balari degree plans for
[01:00:46 - 01:00:49] the hcc board of trustees
[01:00:49 - 01:00:50] consideration by november of trustees
[01:00:50 - 01:00:51] consideration by november of 2026
[01:00:51 - 01:00:54] 2026 with your permission i
[01:00:54 - 01:00:56] will hand over the presentation
[01:00:56 - 01:00:56] to dr ramos who who
[01:00:58 - 01:00:58] will provide a more detailed
[01:00:58 - 01:01:01] overview of how we came
[01:01:01 - 01:01:01] about the selection of these
[01:01:09 - 01:01:09] good afternoon chancellor madam chair
[01:01:09 - 01:01:14] and trustes good afternoon so
[01:01:14 - 01:01:14] i want to walk through
[01:01:14 - 01:01:15] the process a little bit
[01:01:15 - 01:01:15] of how we arrived at
[01:01:15 - 01:01:17] these areas of focus and
[01:01:17 - 01:01:19] i do want to emphasize
[01:01:19 - 01:01:19] from the start that they're
[01:01:21 - 01:01:21] areas of focus but these
[01:01:21 - 01:01:23] are not definitive if for
[01:01:23 - 01:01:25] those of you that were
[01:01:25 - 01:01:26] here during the previous deliberation
[01:01:26 - 01:01:28] around artificial intelligence and healthcare
[01:01:28 - 01:01:29] management we went through some
[01:01:29 - 01:01:31] iterations uh at the beginning
[01:01:31 - 01:01:33] we talked about different strategies
[01:01:33 - 01:01:34] different approaches uh for those
[01:01:34 - 01:01:34] that were here we actually
[01:01:34 - 01:01:36] had begun with a healthcare
[01:01:36 - 01:01:39] management in respiratory therapy and
[01:01:39 - 01:01:40] soon realized why would we
[01:01:40 - 01:01:42] limit ourselves to just respiratory
[01:01:42 - 01:01:42] therapy so we opened up
[01:01:42 - 01:01:45] a little bit so first
[01:01:45 - 01:01:47] i want to illustrate the
[01:01:47 - 01:01:47] timeline going from a h
[01:01:47 - 01:01:50] level one to a level
[01:01:50 - 01:01:50] two so we saw our
[01:01:50 - 01:01:52] first balor graduates in may
[01:01:52 - 01:01:53] which is a great achievement
[01:01:53 - 01:01:53] for them and a high
[01:01:53 - 01:01:56] point for hcc that prompted
[01:01:56 - 01:01:56] the move uh from a
[01:01:58 - 01:01:58] level one to a level
[01:01:58 - 01:02:00] two but this timeline also
[01:02:00 - 01:02:00] illustrates that it was a
[01:02:02 - 01:02:02] long journey to get there
[01:02:02 - 01:02:03] it took us time to
[01:02:03 - 01:02:03] go through the process of
[01:02:05 - 01:02:07] development developing projections developing faculty
[01:02:07 - 01:02:08] strands looking at budget and
[01:02:08 - 01:02:10] also looking at the industry
[01:02:10 - 01:02:10] we did a lot of
[01:02:10 - 01:02:12] research on what's out there
[01:02:12 - 01:02:14] what's needed what's coming next
[01:02:17 - 01:02:17] so now we're in the
[01:02:17 - 01:02:20] early stages of the balora
[01:02:20 - 01:02:21] development process after having identified
[01:02:21 - 01:02:21] the areas of study that
[01:02:21 - 01:02:22] we would like to focus
[01:02:22 - 01:02:22] on which is our our
[01:02:25 - 01:02:27] our topic for today the
[01:02:27 - 01:02:27] selection itself was based on
[01:02:29 - 01:02:29] factors such as potential labor
[01:02:29 - 01:02:32] demand student demand growth opportunities
[01:02:32 - 01:02:34] and considerations of credentials of
[01:02:34 - 01:02:36] value and high demand status
[01:02:36 - 01:02:38] in the region and in
[01:02:38 - 01:02:38] the state so the information
[01:02:38 - 01:02:41] itself was drawn from several
[01:02:41 - 01:02:44] different places faculty groups presented
[01:02:44 - 01:02:46] ideas uh that the cec
[01:02:46 - 01:02:47] considered so they brought forth
[01:02:47 - 01:02:50] their their proposals or pre-proposals
[01:02:50 - 01:02:51] really around several different strands
[01:02:51 - 01:02:51] and we also had the
[01:02:54 - 01:02:54] cec uh make its own
[01:02:54 - 01:02:57] contributions during deliberations and discussions
[01:02:58 - 01:02:58] one of the key uh
[01:02:58 - 01:03:01] pieces of information that we
[01:03:01 - 01:03:01] focused on is a report
[01:03:01 - 01:03:02] from handover research so we
[01:03:02 - 01:03:05] actually worked with handover for
[01:03:05 - 01:03:05] them to develop a uh
[01:03:06 - 01:03:06] market opportunity scan because we
[01:03:08 - 01:03:08] wanted to get a sense
[01:03:08 - 01:03:10] of what opportunities were out
[01:03:10 - 01:03:13] there for hcc in this
[01:03:13 - 01:03:13] balor space so i'd like
[01:03:13 - 01:03:14] to point out on this
[01:03:14 - 01:03:14] chart for those of you
[01:03:14 - 01:03:16] that can see really it
[01:03:16 - 01:03:19] pointed out a couple of
[01:03:19 - 01:03:19] areas so everything that's in
[01:03:19 - 01:03:21] yellow was what they call
[01:03:21 - 01:03:24] the information technology strand everything
[01:03:24 - 01:03:27] in blue was their management
[01:03:27 - 01:03:28] strand so business management organization
[01:03:30 - 01:03:30] leadership these sorts of things
[01:03:30 - 01:03:32] we notice that in green
[01:03:32 - 01:03:34] the registered nurse was also
[01:03:34 - 01:03:36] a high growth performer in
[01:03:36 - 01:03:36] terms of student demand and
[01:03:36 - 01:03:38] labor growth and then we
[01:03:38 - 01:03:40] also already have the healthcare
[01:03:40 - 01:03:41] and health administration management which
[01:03:41 - 01:03:41] as you can see was
[01:03:43 - 01:03:43] high growth on both strands
[01:03:43 - 01:03:45] in fact i think if
[01:03:45 - 01:03:45] you dig deeper into the
[01:03:45 - 01:03:47] report that was the highest
[01:03:47 - 01:03:48] demand uh over time time
[01:03:48 - 01:03:48] they had a high growth
[01:03:49 - 01:03:49] potential in healthcare management so
[01:03:52 - 01:03:52] it's great that we already
[01:03:52 - 01:03:54] have that so after looking
[01:03:54 - 01:03:56] at these strands looking at
[01:03:56 - 01:03:56] the information from the proposals
[01:03:58 - 01:03:58] and then also the community
[01:03:58 - 01:04:00] survey reports that were administered
[01:04:00 - 01:04:02] last fall in our community
[01:04:02 - 01:04:03] partnership meetings uh as dr
[01:04:03 - 01:04:03] bur just mentioned some of
[01:04:03 - 01:04:05] her presentations in those meetings
[01:04:05 - 01:04:07] uh this uh in the
[01:04:07 - 01:04:07] past couple of weeks the
[01:04:09 - 01:04:09] three strands that people focus
[01:04:09 - 01:04:11] on the most in the
[01:04:11 - 01:04:13] community are business health management
[01:04:13 - 01:04:15] and uh artificial intelligence so
[01:04:15 - 01:04:18] again in that technology computing
[01:04:18 - 01:04:21] space so based on all
[01:04:21 - 01:04:23] of these factors and these
[01:04:23 - 01:04:25] deliberations we've identified the general
[01:04:25 - 01:04:28] areas of computer information systems
[01:04:28 - 01:04:28] nursing and business so the
[01:04:30 - 01:04:30] snapshot that you see in
[01:04:30 - 01:04:32] this slide is based off
[01:04:32 - 01:04:32] litecast data so it kind
[01:04:32 - 01:04:33] of illustrates the potential for
[01:04:33 - 01:04:35] some of these areas in
[01:04:35 - 01:04:37] terms of annual uh starting
[01:04:37 - 01:04:39] average starting salary annual openings
[01:04:39 - 01:04:41] and the 5-year growth potential
[01:04:41 - 01:04:42] this data will change over
[01:04:43 - 01:04:43] time as we investigate the
[01:04:43 - 01:04:45] various possibilities within each of
[01:04:45 - 01:04:47] these degrees i think the
[01:04:47 - 01:04:48] only one and dr harrison
[01:04:48 - 01:04:48] you can tell me if
[01:04:48 - 01:04:50] i'm totally off base here
[01:04:50 - 01:04:50] the only one that won't
[01:04:52 - 01:04:52] have specializations is probably nursing
[01:04:54 - 01:04:54] because a bsn is a
[01:04:54 - 01:04:57] bsn it doesn't have any
[01:04:57 - 01:04:57] other any other flavors um
[01:04:58 - 01:04:58] business is probably the one
[01:04:58 - 01:05:00] that has the most possibility
[01:05:00 - 01:05:01] for uh specializations because there's
[01:05:01 - 01:05:03] not only is there a
[01:05:03 - 01:05:03] wide range of topic areas
[01:05:05 - 01:05:05] within business itself and management
[01:05:08 - 01:05:08] leadership but there's also a
[01:05:08 - 01:05:10] lot of opportunity outside the
[01:05:10 - 01:05:11] discipline for management in other
[01:05:11 - 01:05:13] spaces we already have healthcare
[01:05:13 - 01:05:15] management but there's uh industrial
[01:05:15 - 01:05:16] management operations management so there's
[01:05:16 - 01:05:19] other opportunities in that area
[01:05:22 - 01:05:22] the general timeline is development
[01:05:22 - 01:05:25] from fall of 25 through
[01:05:25 - 01:05:27] september of 2026 so over
[01:05:27 - 01:05:27] the next year we're going
[01:05:27 - 01:05:29] to be having these discussions
[01:05:29 - 01:05:32] development i think the first
[01:05:32 - 01:05:32] idea is to kind of
[01:05:32 - 01:05:33] pick the house we've already
[01:05:33 - 01:05:35] identified the rough the neighborhoods
[01:05:35 - 01:05:36] that we want to be
[01:05:36 - 01:05:36] in now we got to
[01:05:36 - 01:05:38] define what kind of house
[01:05:38 - 01:05:38] we have what is the
[01:05:38 - 01:05:39] structure of the degree that
[01:05:39 - 01:05:41] we're looking for because once
[01:05:41 - 01:05:43] we identify for example the
[01:05:43 - 01:05:43] zip codes that we're going
[01:05:43 - 01:05:45] to be using we can
[01:05:45 - 01:05:48] start then deliberating on facilities
[01:05:48 - 01:05:50] faculty needs uh financing all
[01:05:50 - 01:05:50] of the different budget elements
[01:05:52 - 01:05:52] that come into play our
[01:05:52 - 01:05:55] goal is to have a
[01:05:55 - 01:05:55] rough estimate of budgets sometime
[01:05:55 - 01:05:56] uh before we start the
[01:05:56 - 01:05:58] budget cycle so we can
[01:05:58 - 01:05:58] include that in our preparations
[01:05:58 - 01:06:01] for the following year so
[01:06:01 - 01:06:03] in september through october of
[01:06:03 - 01:06:03] 2026 our plan is to
[01:06:06 - 01:06:06] have the fully realized degree
[01:06:06 - 01:06:07] plans for in front of
[01:06:07 - 01:06:09] the curriculum and dean council
[01:06:09 - 01:06:09] for review followed by our
[01:06:09 - 01:06:12] chief academic officer review with
[01:06:12 - 01:06:14] ultimate uh uh review by
[01:06:14 - 01:06:14] the board of trustees in
[01:06:17 - 01:06:17] november or december of 2026
[01:06:17 - 01:06:19] uh depending on how close
[01:06:19 - 01:06:19] we want to be to
[01:06:21 - 01:06:21] the submission date for the
[01:06:21 - 01:06:23] cb in january we would
[01:06:23 - 01:06:24] submit to the texas higher
[01:06:24 - 01:06:27] uh education coordinating board followed
[01:06:27 - 01:06:27] by sas submission so both
[01:06:27 - 01:06:28] any degrees at the backord
[01:06:28 - 01:06:30] level are going to need
[01:06:30 - 01:06:30] to go through sax review
[01:06:30 - 01:06:32] and then finally we would
[01:06:32 - 01:06:35] hope for a july 22
[01:06:35 - 01:06:35] 27 sachs approval decision with
[01:06:37 - 01:06:37] implementation to follow in august
[01:06:37 - 01:06:38] of implementation to follow in
[01:06:38 - 01:06:41] august of 2027 2027 so
[01:06:41 - 01:06:41] i think that the primary
[01:06:41 - 01:06:43] focus at least initially will
[01:06:43 - 01:06:45] be in the business area
[01:06:45 - 01:06:46] and the computer information systems
[01:06:46 - 01:06:46] area we want to make
[01:06:46 - 01:06:49] sure that we get through
[01:06:49 - 01:06:49] uh cleanly on the nursing
[01:06:51 - 01:06:51] programs before we make that
[01:06:51 - 01:06:52] attempt but that doesn't mean
[01:06:52 - 01:06:54] we can't work on the
[01:06:54 - 01:06:54] balor degree in the next
[01:06:54 - 01:06:56] year for nursing as well
[01:06:56 - 01:06:56] just to be prepared for
[01:06:58 - 01:07:01] all eventualities so that is
[01:07:01 - 01:07:01] the end of the formal
[01:07:03 - 01:07:03] presentation but i'm happy to
[01:07:03 - 01:07:05] entertain any questions or comments
[01:07:05 - 01:07:06] uh that you all may
[01:07:06 - 01:07:10] have colleagues any questions trustee
[01:07:10 - 01:07:12] siobhan appreciate the presentation and
[01:07:12 - 01:07:14] an incredibly exciting um opportunity
[01:07:14 - 01:07:16] for the institution and for
[01:07:16 - 01:07:18] the greater keyson community going
[01:07:18 - 01:07:20] forward on this um just
[01:07:20 - 01:07:20] want to say the the
[01:07:20 - 01:07:22] one of these that is
[01:07:22 - 01:07:23] you know hands down support
[01:07:23 - 01:07:23] go as quickly as we
[01:07:23 - 01:07:25] possibly can from my perspective
[01:07:25 - 01:07:26] is the nursing degree i
[01:07:26 - 01:07:26] think there's a clear need
[01:07:26 - 01:07:29] we got a clear lane
[01:07:29 - 01:07:29] um the faster that we
[01:07:31 - 01:07:31] can get that up and
[01:07:31 - 01:07:33] running um in my perspective
[01:07:33 - 01:07:33] the better um on the
[01:07:35 - 01:07:35] other two i heard what
[01:07:35 - 01:07:37] y'all heard in the community
[01:07:37 - 01:07:39] um partnerships meeting where there
[01:07:39 - 01:07:39] was a lot of interest
[01:07:39 - 01:07:41] in these uh in these
[01:07:41 - 01:07:43] degree paths and these pathways
[01:07:43 - 01:07:44] um i think there's there's
[01:07:44 - 01:07:44] two elements that i'd really
[01:07:45 - 01:07:45] want to make sure that
[01:07:45 - 01:07:47] we're diligent about as we're
[01:07:47 - 01:07:49] developing these materials through the
[01:07:49 - 01:07:53] fall semester um the first
[01:07:53 - 01:07:53] is these are pathways that
[01:07:55 - 01:07:55] have a lot of current
[01:07:55 - 01:07:57] activity with some of our
[01:07:57 - 01:07:59] four-year partner institutions uv uv
[01:07:59 - 01:07:59] downtown as well as some
[01:07:59 - 01:08:02] of the bigger statewide universities
[01:08:02 - 01:08:05] and so um question number
[01:08:05 - 01:08:07] one um have y'all had
[01:08:07 - 01:08:07] an opportunity to engage with
[01:08:07 - 01:08:09] our four-year partner institutions about
[01:08:09 - 01:08:12] how our offering might flange
[01:08:12 - 01:08:14] up or compete with their
[01:08:14 - 01:08:16] four-year offerings to make sure
[01:08:16 - 01:08:16] that we're we're not actively
[01:08:18 - 01:08:18] competing over the same needs
[01:08:18 - 01:08:19] that we have discrete lanes
[01:08:19 - 01:08:21] and that you know everybody
[01:08:21 - 01:08:21] can attract the students that
[01:08:23 - 01:08:23] that would be attracted by
[01:08:23 - 01:08:23] the that would be attracted
[01:08:23 - 01:08:25] by the institutions institutions sure
[01:08:25 - 01:08:25] we haven't had direct discussions
[01:08:28 - 01:08:28] with four years we do
[01:08:28 - 01:08:30] scan the four years to
[01:08:30 - 01:08:30] make sure that we have
[01:08:30 - 01:08:32] uh some space to work
[01:08:32 - 01:08:34] with there's actually a formal
[01:08:34 - 01:08:34] process through the cb in
[01:08:34 - 01:08:36] which we submit the planning
[01:08:36 - 01:08:39] uh to them and the
[01:08:39 - 01:08:39] cb reaches out to the
[01:08:39 - 01:08:41] herk so the regional gf
[01:08:41 - 01:08:41] coast council here and they
[01:08:43 - 01:08:43] then have an opportunity to
[01:08:43 - 01:08:45] provide information to us about
[01:08:45 - 01:08:46] any concerns they may have
[01:08:46 - 01:08:48] it's a pretty standard process
[01:08:48 - 01:08:50] we receive those notifications all
[01:08:50 - 01:08:50] the time i think recently
[01:08:50 - 01:08:52] we got a masters in
[01:08:52 - 01:08:52] computer science to review uh
[01:08:54 - 01:08:54] which doesn't really affect us
[01:08:54 - 01:08:56] so we said that's fine
[01:08:56 - 01:08:57] but every institution in the
[01:08:57 - 01:08:59] region receives a notification and
[01:08:59 - 01:08:59] each president receives it and
[01:08:59 - 01:09:01] they distribute it to their
[01:09:01 - 01:09:02] provos or chief academic officers
[01:09:02 - 01:09:02] and we have those academic
[01:09:03 - 01:09:04] officers and we have those
[01:09:04 - 01:09:06] conversations conversations no thanks for
[01:09:06 - 01:09:06] that i'll just over the
[01:09:07 - 01:09:07] next month i think it'd
[01:09:07 - 01:09:08] be really helpful before y'all
[01:09:08 - 01:09:10] come back to us just
[01:09:10 - 01:09:10] to to have conversations especially
[01:09:12 - 01:09:12] with those houston area for
[01:09:12 - 01:09:14] your institutions um so that
[01:09:14 - 01:09:17] we can get you know
[01:09:17 - 01:09:17] their input through you in
[01:09:17 - 01:09:18] that presentation about everybody's comfort
[01:09:20 - 01:09:20] level with us standing up
[01:09:20 - 01:09:21] what could from the outside
[01:09:21 - 01:09:23] look like competing pathways i
[01:09:23 - 01:09:23] think that would be a
[01:09:23 - 01:09:25] really helpful addition to that
[01:09:25 - 01:09:27] presentation um the second question
[01:09:27 - 01:09:30] is on the computer information
[01:09:30 - 01:09:31] systems um there's a lot
[01:09:31 - 01:09:31] of buzz in the last
[01:09:31 - 01:09:34] couple of weeks about ai
[01:09:34 - 01:09:37] finally starting to visibly chip
[01:09:37 - 01:09:37] away at employment data in
[01:09:38 - 01:09:38] those uh systems i think
[01:09:38 - 01:09:41] the st louis fed just
[01:09:41 - 01:09:41] issued a report um showing
[01:09:41 - 01:09:43] that both computer science and
[01:09:43 - 01:09:46] computer engineering undermployment statistics are
[01:09:46 - 01:09:46] a couple of percentage points
[01:09:46 - 01:09:49] higher than the broad graduating
[01:09:49 - 01:09:52] undergraduate population um and so
[01:09:52 - 01:09:55] a curious um how y'all
[01:09:55 - 01:09:55] are taking things like that
[01:09:55 - 01:09:57] into account but b curious
[01:09:57 - 01:10:00] if if the employment situation
[01:10:00 - 01:10:01] in the computer science and
[01:10:01 - 01:10:03] computer engineering sectors degrades further
[01:10:03 - 01:10:06] because of the impacts of
[01:10:06 - 01:10:06] ai is there a backup
[01:10:06 - 01:10:08] plan um like is there
[01:10:08 - 01:10:08] another degree path that we
[01:10:09 - 01:10:09] could explore that's less exposed
[01:10:09 - 01:10:11] to that kind of like
[01:10:11 - 01:10:14] ai influenced short-term um you
[01:10:14 - 01:10:16] know employment opportunity impact so
[01:10:16 - 01:10:18] that we can still fill
[01:10:18 - 01:10:18] out our our dance card
[01:10:18 - 01:10:20] of five pathways without diving
[01:10:20 - 01:10:21] into something that's already kind
[01:10:21 - 01:10:23] of structurally weak from an
[01:10:23 - 01:10:24] employment standpoint absolutely like we
[01:10:24 - 01:10:26] always want to make sure
[01:10:26 - 01:10:26] we have backup plans so
[01:10:26 - 01:10:29] we there were other ideas
[01:10:29 - 01:10:29] in the hopper in terms
[01:10:30 - 01:10:30] of what we might consider
[01:10:30 - 01:10:32] for a baloric degree and
[01:10:32 - 01:10:32] certainly putting out a call
[01:10:35 - 01:10:35] for more ideas is always
[01:10:35 - 01:10:38] an option in terms of
[01:10:38 - 01:10:38] examining market and labor uh
[01:10:40 - 01:10:40] information that is something we
[01:10:42 - 01:10:42] constantly are engaged with so
[01:10:42 - 01:10:44] for example when we were
[01:10:44 - 01:10:45] looking at healthcare management and
[01:10:45 - 01:10:47] artificial intelligence we actually did
[01:10:47 - 01:10:49] a deep dive on a
[01:10:49 - 01:10:49] lot of not just think
[01:10:49 - 01:10:51] pieces but also uh presidential
[01:10:51 - 01:10:53] commission reports on artificial intelligence
[01:10:53 - 01:10:54] labor market from the department
[01:10:54 - 01:10:56] of labor on healthcare management
[01:10:56 - 01:10:58] so it's very deliberate process
[01:10:58 - 01:10:58] and one thing that i
[01:11:00 - 01:11:00] can say with full confidence
[01:11:00 - 01:11:03] is that we would not
[01:11:03 - 01:11:03] propose an award in which
[01:11:03 - 01:11:07] we saw a a decline
[01:11:07 - 01:11:09] in potential over time one
[01:11:09 - 01:11:09] of the key components in
[01:11:09 - 01:11:11] our annual program vitality reporting
[01:11:11 - 01:11:13] is an automation or i'm
[01:11:13 - 01:11:15] sorry in our liccast reporting
[01:11:15 - 01:11:15] is the automation index which
[01:11:17 - 01:11:17] gives us a long-term view
[01:11:17 - 01:11:19] about the extent to which
[01:11:19 - 01:11:21] a particular discipline may be
[01:11:21 - 01:11:24] affected or impacted negatively by
[01:11:24 - 01:11:24] automation components uh so we
[01:11:26 - 01:11:26] always take that into account
[01:11:26 - 01:11:28] as well in terms of
[01:11:28 - 01:11:28] the long term the flip
[01:11:28 - 01:11:31] side of that is trying
[01:11:31 - 01:11:33] to gauge the the long-term
[01:11:33 - 01:11:35] perspective of the field itself
[01:11:35 - 01:11:35] so for example if you
[01:11:35 - 01:11:37] had tried to go to
[01:11:37 - 01:11:37] law school 10 years ago
[01:11:37 - 01:11:39] people would have said you
[01:11:39 - 01:11:41] were crazy because the law
[01:11:41 - 01:11:43] school enrollment had plummeted and
[01:11:43 - 01:11:43] and been destroyed essentially but
[01:11:44 - 01:11:44] it's made a comeback so
[01:11:44 - 01:11:47] at some point it there
[01:11:47 - 01:11:47] was an additional uh increase
[01:11:49 - 01:11:49] in enrollment one of the
[01:11:49 - 01:11:51] areas that we always focus
[01:11:51 - 01:11:51] on with that in that
[01:11:51 - 01:11:53] regard is petroleum we see
[01:11:53 - 01:11:55] peaks and valleys depending on
[01:11:55 - 01:11:55] the market and so we
[01:11:57 - 01:11:57] generally tend to not panic
[01:11:57 - 01:11:59] too much about declines in
[01:11:59 - 01:11:59] a given year we try
[01:12:01 - 01:12:01] to look at the long-term
[01:12:01 - 01:12:02] perspectives uh in order to
[01:12:02 - 01:12:05] understand whether something should be
[01:12:05 - 01:12:06] you know consolidated or deleted
[01:12:06 - 01:12:06] or if it's simply something
[01:12:06 - 01:12:08] we see in the market
[01:12:08 - 01:12:08] at that time but it's
[01:12:10 - 01:12:10] going to come back at
[01:12:10 - 01:12:13] some point all right thank
[01:12:13 - 01:12:15] you you're welcome thank you

[01:16:16 - 01:16:17] clear understanding of the impacts
[01:16:17 - 01:16:22] of this amazing program this
[01:16:22 - 01:16:22] is just giving you an
[01:16:22 - 01:16:24] overview of the two types
[01:16:24 - 01:16:26] of pathways which align with
[01:16:26 - 01:16:26] the types of endorsements that
[01:16:27 - 01:16:27] students are placed in which
[01:16:27 - 01:16:29] would be academic or workforce
[01:16:29 - 01:16:31] early college high schools align
[01:16:31 - 01:16:33] more with the academic whereas
[01:16:33 - 01:16:33] pek would be more academic
[01:16:33 - 01:16:34] whereas pek would be more
[01:16:35 - 01:16:37] workforce workforce here you have
[01:16:37 - 01:16:39] the definitions and the types
[01:16:39 - 01:16:39] of the dual credit that
[01:16:39 - 01:16:41] are offered here through our
[01:16:41 - 01:16:42] dual credit program which are
[01:16:42 - 01:16:45] the early college high school
[01:16:45 - 01:16:45] the pek and traditional now
[01:16:46 - 01:16:46] let me say we're growing
[01:16:46 - 01:16:48] in all of these areas
[01:16:48 - 01:16:48] which you'll see some evidence
[01:16:48 - 01:16:51] of that in a moment
[01:16:52 - 01:16:52] these as you look at
[01:16:52 - 01:16:56] all the dots on this
[01:16:56 - 01:16:56] screen and they grow each
[01:16:56 - 01:16:57] year we have more and
[01:16:57 - 01:16:59] more dual credit locations so
[01:16:59 - 01:17:01] this represents all of the
[01:17:01 - 01:17:01] dual credit locations across the
[01:17:03 - 01:17:03] district that hcc currently participates
[01:17:06 - 01:17:06] in and this focuses on
[01:17:06 - 01:17:08] the early college high schools
[01:17:08 - 01:17:09] which you see there are
[01:17:09 - 01:17:12] several early college high schools
[01:17:12 - 01:17:15] on this map now let's
[01:17:15 - 01:17:15] get into an overview of
[01:17:15 - 01:17:17] the entire early high school
[01:17:17 - 01:17:19] process the process of early
[01:17:19 - 01:17:23] college high school designation is
[01:17:23 - 01:17:24] initiated by k12 partners where
[01:17:24 - 01:17:28] it indicates this partnering institution
[01:17:28 - 01:17:28] or iia uh to deliver
[01:17:28 - 01:17:30] the college courses as noted
[01:17:30 - 01:17:32] the process is ongoing and
[01:17:32 - 01:17:34] has multiple stages so with
[01:17:34 - 01:17:34] all of our early high
[01:17:34 - 01:17:36] schools they will be in
[01:17:36 - 01:17:38] different stages depending upon the
[01:17:38 - 01:17:38] year that they were established
[01:17:41 - 01:17:46] or approved by tea hcc
[01:17:46 - 01:17:46] has four isd partners with
[01:17:46 - 01:17:48] 12 early college high school
[01:17:48 - 01:17:51] locations whereas hisd has the
[01:17:51 - 01:17:51] most which are nine and
[01:17:52 - 01:17:54] of those nine two shartown
[01:17:54 - 01:17:56] international and westside are newly
[01:17:56 - 01:17:58] designated starting this fall they're
[01:17:58 - 01:18:01] considered schools within a school
[01:18:04 - 01:18:04] now as reported in us
[01:18:04 - 01:18:06] news as dr perez said
[01:18:06 - 01:18:06] a moment ago many of
[01:18:06 - 01:18:09] houston area schools rank high
[01:18:09 - 01:18:09] of the top 15 hcc
[01:18:11 - 01:18:11] provides dual credit for 11
[01:18:11 - 01:18:14] of those schools now we're
[01:18:14 - 01:18:16] continuing to spread out and
[01:18:16 - 01:18:16] hopefully we'll get to most
[01:18:16 - 01:18:17] of all of these schools
[01:18:17 - 01:18:20] if they're within our service
[01:18:20 - 01:18:23] area here you'll see the
[01:18:23 - 01:18:25] data indicates stable early college
[01:18:25 - 01:18:27] enrollment from year to year
[01:18:27 - 01:18:33] with a cumulative increase the
[01:18:33 - 01:18:33] data for completers and let
[01:18:33 - 01:18:35] me define completers for you
[01:18:35 - 01:18:37] completers are the students who've
[01:18:37 - 01:18:38] earned an award while they're
[01:18:38 - 01:18:38] in dual credit so that's
[01:18:40 - 01:18:40] what completers is referring to
[01:18:40 - 01:18:42] and you can see there's
[01:18:42 - 01:18:46] an increase there as moving
[01:18:46 - 01:18:46] from year to year as
[01:18:46 - 01:18:48] well the data here in
[01:18:48 - 01:18:50] regard to awards because of
[01:18:50 - 01:18:52] course the completers they earn
[01:18:52 - 01:18:52] awards there's an increase here
[01:18:52 - 01:18:55] as well and from academic
[01:18:55 - 01:18:55] year 22 to 25 by
[01:18:55 - 01:18:56] well and from academic year
[01:18:56 - 01:18:57] 22 to 25 by 40
[01:18:57 - 01:19:00] 1 40 1 and from
[01:19:00 - 01:19:00] academic year 24 to academic
[01:19:03 - 01:19:03] year 25 there's a 7
[01:19:03 - 01:19:07] 5 increase so we're doing
[01:19:07 - 01:19:09] better year after year early
[01:19:09 - 01:19:09] college high school rates indicate
[01:19:11 - 01:19:11] overall stability and in most
[01:19:11 - 01:19:13] casement cases is improving so
[01:19:13 - 01:19:15] we're working on those areas
[01:19:15 - 01:19:15] that we need to focus
[01:19:15 - 01:19:17] on and those areas where
[01:19:17 - 01:19:23] we're doing well we here
[01:19:23 - 01:19:23] the number of students returning
[01:19:25 - 01:19:25] to hcc from early college
[01:19:25 - 01:19:28] dual credit programs is decreasing
[01:19:28 - 01:19:30] that's not negative that's a
[01:19:30 - 01:19:32] positive because it means more
[01:19:32 - 01:19:33] students are completing and that's
[01:19:33 - 01:19:33] the purpose for those students
[01:19:33 - 01:19:35] to be here they're completing
[01:19:35 - 01:19:37] and they're receiving their awards
[01:19:37 - 01:19:39] the most recent graduation acts
[01:19:39 - 01:19:41] as evidence of the everinccreasing
[01:19:41 - 01:19:46] number of graduates from this
[01:19:46 - 01:19:46] slide just indicates the number
[01:19:46 - 01:19:48] of tr the transfer schools
[01:19:48 - 01:19:51] for all of those early
[01:19:51 - 01:19:51] colleges and as you see
[01:19:51 - 01:19:52] it's a wide range of
[01:19:52 - 01:20:00] schools university of in regard
[01:20:00 - 01:20:00] to the supports for dual
[01:20:00 - 01:20:00] in regard to the supports
[01:20:01 - 01:20:03] for dual credit credit there
[01:20:03 - 01:20:03] are multiple tiered supports as
[01:20:05 - 01:20:05] noted on this slide each
[01:20:05 - 01:20:08] early college area has a
[01:20:08 - 01:20:11] dedicated p16 director advising team
[01:20:11 - 01:20:11] and also they have uh
[01:20:13 - 01:20:13] other support staff these teams
[01:20:14 - 01:20:15] provide comprehensive supports to the
[01:20:15 - 01:20:17] early college and dual credit
[01:20:17 - 01:20:18] students from the time of
[01:20:18 - 01:20:21] onboarding throughout graduation the supports
[01:20:21 - 01:20:24] include degree plan distributions pro
[01:20:24 - 01:20:26] progress meetings early alert follow-ups
[01:20:26 - 01:20:27] with necessary academic and non-academic
[01:20:29 - 01:20:29] supports just to name a
[01:20:29 - 01:20:31] few furthermore the dean and
[01:20:31 - 01:20:33] associate dean act as a
[01:20:33 - 01:20:33] second tier of support with
[01:20:33 - 01:20:35] the follow-up as needed with
[01:20:35 - 01:20:37] the isds through monthly dual
[01:20:37 - 01:20:38] credit advisory committee meetings where
[01:20:38 - 01:20:40] feedback is solicited and necessary
[01:20:40 - 01:20:47] actions are to provide further
[01:20:47 - 01:20:48] detail you see the different
[01:20:48 - 01:20:48] types of processes we have
[01:20:50 - 01:20:50] here in regard to the
[01:20:50 - 01:20:53] early college process the students
[01:20:53 - 01:20:55] are identified by the isds
[01:20:55 - 01:20:55] again as i said with
[01:20:55 - 01:20:58] the tea designation of early
[01:20:58 - 01:20:59] college or pek information comes
[01:20:59 - 01:21:01] from the high school and
[01:21:01 - 01:21:01] we work collaboratively with those
[01:21:02 - 01:21:02] high schools whereas at some
[01:21:02 - 01:21:05] point there's a workshop and
[01:21:05 - 01:21:07] various meetings with the p16
[01:21:07 - 01:21:07] team and the early colleges
[01:21:09 - 01:21:09] where the public students so
[01:21:09 - 01:21:11] forth and so on are
[01:21:11 - 01:21:11] able to work through those
[01:21:13 - 01:21:13] processes and you can see
[01:21:13 - 01:21:14] at number three the commit
[01:21:14 - 01:21:16] to complete and working to
[01:21:16 - 01:21:16] ensure we get the buyin
[01:21:16 - 01:21:18] from the students and their
[01:21:18 - 01:21:20] families at the beginning of
[01:21:20 - 01:21:20] their entire early uh dual
[01:21:23 - 01:21:23] cur dual credit process then
[01:21:23 - 01:21:25] we have degree plan reviews
[01:21:25 - 01:21:26] throughout the process and of
[01:21:26 - 01:21:30] course we monitor their progress
[01:21:30 - 01:21:30] all the way through completion
[01:21:32 - 01:21:32] in conclusion the early college
[01:21:34 - 01:21:34] designation is determined by tea
[01:21:34 - 01:21:37] we have multiple partnerships with
[01:21:37 - 01:21:40] various different isds and of
[01:21:40 - 01:21:42] course one msd early college
[01:21:42 - 01:21:44] enrollment is going up the
[01:21:44 - 01:21:47] completers are increasing the awards
[01:21:47 - 01:21:49] are increasing success rates remain
[01:21:49 - 01:21:49] relatively high and stable our
[01:21:50 - 01:21:50] supports as you just saw
[01:21:50 - 01:21:53] a moment ago are very
[01:21:53 - 01:21:53] robust and the process is
[01:21:55 - 01:21:55] collaborative and student centered so
[01:21:57 - 01:21:57] i'll take any questions that
[01:21:57 - 01:21:58] you have at this time
[01:22:00 - 01:22:00] yes thank you for that
[01:22:00 - 01:22:04] presentation i i do you
[01:22:04 - 01:22:04] mentioned earlier the um the
[01:22:06 - 01:22:06] number of high school students
[01:22:06 - 01:22:08] uh in dual credit is
[01:22:08 - 01:22:10] uh the number is decreasing
[01:22:10 - 01:22:10] in terms of enrollment or
[01:22:13 - 01:22:13] continuing the enrollment in hcc
[01:22:13 - 01:22:16] and that that's a good
[01:22:16 - 01:22:19] thing right and so but
[01:22:19 - 01:22:19] now that we're offering um
[01:22:19 - 01:22:23] four-year degrees what is the
[01:22:23 - 01:22:23] plan uh of this area
[01:22:26 - 01:22:26] to market that so that
[01:22:26 - 01:22:29] we do get these students
[01:22:29 - 01:22:29] to come in and enroll
[01:22:29 - 01:22:30] in these new four-year degrees
[01:22:31 - 01:22:31] it's a great question i'm
[01:22:31 - 01:22:33] glad you asked it now
[01:22:33 - 01:22:33] i was focusing on when
[01:22:33 - 01:22:34] i said the number was
[01:22:34 - 01:22:36] going down on the early
[01:22:36 - 01:22:36] college students whose purpose is
[01:22:38 - 01:22:38] to obtain the the associates
[01:22:38 - 01:22:39] degree while they're in school
[01:22:39 - 01:22:41] so they're completing those the
[01:22:41 - 01:22:43] plan to move forward with
[01:22:43 - 01:22:43] that is we're meeting with
[01:22:45 - 01:22:45] our students in the process
[01:22:45 - 01:22:47] now to see how many
[01:22:47 - 01:22:47] of those students we can
[01:22:47 - 01:22:48] get to obtain additional credentials
[01:22:48 - 01:22:50] while they're in school additional
[01:22:50 - 01:22:51] credentials correct yeah that's what
[01:22:51 - 01:22:52] we're doing we have a
[01:22:54 - 01:22:54] we have boot camps we
[01:22:54 - 01:22:56] have in fact dr perez
[01:22:56 - 01:22:56] and i have a meeting
[01:22:56 - 01:22:58] tomorrow with hisd to speak
[01:22:58 - 01:22:58] through some of these uh
[01:23:00 - 01:23:00] matters and also we've met
[01:23:00 - 01:23:02] with various other districts in
[01:23:02 - 01:23:03] regard to those same opportunities
[01:23:03 - 01:23:05] but to answer your question
[01:23:05 - 01:23:07] specifically dean chavez and her
[01:23:07 - 01:23:09] team they're collaboratively and strategically
[01:23:09 - 01:23:09] working with each of the
[01:23:11 - 01:23:11] partners to align what those
[01:23:11 - 01:23:13] students are doing within their
[01:23:13 - 01:23:14] degree plans that they're on
[01:23:14 - 01:23:14] at the school and their
[01:23:16 - 01:23:16] future plans if their plans
[01:23:16 - 01:23:18] align with a 4-year degree
[01:23:18 - 01:23:19] or certificate with the programs
[01:23:19 - 01:23:19] that we're offering here at
[01:23:19 - 01:23:20] programs that we're offering here
[01:23:20 - 01:23:23] at hcc hcc yes because
[01:23:23 - 01:23:23] this dual credit program i
[01:23:26 - 01:23:26] i would like and us
[01:23:26 - 01:23:29] to continue to see that
[01:23:29 - 01:23:29] as a as a pathway
[01:23:29 - 01:23:30] to get students that as
[01:23:30 - 01:23:30] a as a pathway to
[01:23:30 - 01:23:32] get students here here right
[01:23:32 - 01:23:32] and and with with what
[01:23:32 - 01:23:34] you just said whether it's
[01:23:34 - 01:23:36] through you know looking at
[01:23:36 - 01:23:38] some other certification after they
[01:23:38 - 01:23:40] get that two-year associates a
[01:23:40 - 01:23:40] four-year degree or whatever that
[01:23:40 - 01:23:43] may be uh so okay
[01:23:43 - 01:23:45] that there's that the other
[01:23:45 - 01:23:45] thing is you you you
[01:23:45 - 01:23:49] are referring to isd so
[01:23:49 - 01:23:49] you're eliminating and i know
[01:23:51 - 01:23:51] we've talked about private schools
[01:23:51 - 01:23:52] and and how we've tried
[01:23:52 - 01:23:55] that but i still think
[01:23:55 - 01:23:55] that's a whole other area
[01:23:55 - 01:23:57] that we really need to
[01:23:57 - 01:23:57] market to and that's that
[01:24:00 - 01:24:00] private school setting uh because
[01:24:00 - 01:24:02] not all of those students
[01:24:02 - 01:24:02] are are going to a
[01:24:04 - 01:24:04] four-year degree like is the
[01:24:04 - 01:24:07] case in any school system
[01:24:07 - 01:24:07] right and then also when
[01:24:10 - 01:24:10] you just say isds or
[01:24:10 - 01:24:13] msds uh you're also leaving
[01:24:13 - 01:24:13] out not only the three
[01:24:15 - 01:24:15] charters you're working with now
[01:24:15 - 01:24:18] but also all the other
[01:24:18 - 01:24:19] potential charter schools that we
[01:24:19 - 01:24:22] could be working with so
[01:24:22 - 01:24:22] moving forward i'd like us
[01:24:22 - 01:24:23] to to tweak that if
[01:24:23 - 01:24:23] you don't mind and and
[01:24:26 - 01:24:26] let's be more i don't
[01:24:26 - 01:24:28] know if we say school
[01:24:28 - 01:24:28] systems or or how we
[01:24:28 - 01:24:31] say that but when we
[01:24:31 - 01:24:31] just identify it as an
[01:24:31 - 01:24:35] isd we we leave out
[01:24:35 - 01:24:35] all the other potential you
[01:24:37 - 01:24:37] know uh uh students that
[01:24:37 - 01:24:39] are attending these um these
[01:24:39 - 01:24:42] other institutions that that need
[01:24:42 - 01:24:42] to partner with us so
[01:24:42 - 01:24:45] i just wanted to to
[01:24:45 - 01:24:45] to say that and um
[01:24:45 - 01:24:47] but other than that the
[01:24:47 - 01:24:49] presentation's very clear um i
[01:24:49 - 01:24:49] like what i'm seeing so
[01:24:49 - 01:24:51] thank you i appreciate that
[01:24:51 - 01:24:55] colleagues any questions or comments
[01:24:55 - 01:24:57] trusty sheen just one second
[01:24:57 - 01:24:58] amazing presentation and amazing work
[01:24:58 - 01:24:58] by by the whole team
[01:25:00 - 01:25:00] it's really great to see
[01:25:00 - 01:25:01] these numbers continue to to
[01:25:01 - 01:25:03] move in the right direction
[01:25:03 - 01:25:03] and i know y'all are
[01:25:03 - 01:25:04] impacting a ton of lives
[01:25:04 - 01:25:04] by the work that you're
[01:25:07 - 01:25:07] doing um the one question
[01:25:07 - 01:25:09] i had on here is
[01:25:09 - 01:25:09] um on your your first
[01:25:09 - 01:25:10] three panel slide with the
[01:25:10 - 01:25:12] different offerings of the academic
[01:25:12 - 01:25:15] associates the pek and dual
[01:25:15 - 01:25:15] credit um i i was
[01:25:15 - 01:25:17] a little bit surprised to
[01:25:17 - 01:25:17] see that we don't yet
[01:25:17 - 01:25:21] have kind of a standalone
[01:25:21 - 01:25:23] pek um early college program
[01:25:23 - 01:25:24] so curious from your perspective
[01:25:24 - 01:25:25] with with the different conversations
[01:25:25 - 01:25:25] you're having with our isd
[01:25:28 - 01:25:28] partners and charter partners um
[01:25:28 - 01:25:30] is there an appetite for
[01:25:30 - 01:25:31] that and is that something
[01:25:31 - 01:25:31] that we could see in
[01:25:31 - 01:25:34] the next 3 five years
[01:25:34 - 01:25:34] standing up a pek dedicated
[01:25:36 - 01:25:36] or pek focused campus to
[01:25:36 - 01:25:39] really meet that need okay
[01:25:39 - 01:25:39] well i'm glad you mentioned
[01:25:39 - 01:25:43] that and it speaks also
[01:25:43 - 01:25:46] to um trustee tamas we
[01:25:46 - 01:25:46] do have peks we have
[01:25:46 - 01:25:48] several peks um but this
[01:25:48 - 01:25:50] this particular uh presentation focused
[01:25:50 - 01:25:52] on the early college so
[01:25:52 - 01:25:52] the early college and the
[01:25:55 - 01:25:55] pex or forms of um
[01:25:55 - 01:25:57] moving students through to let
[01:25:57 - 01:25:57] them obtain so it wasn't
[01:25:59 - 01:25:59] an oversight with the msds
[01:25:59 - 01:26:01] or the isds it's just
[01:26:01 - 01:26:02] that with the charter schools
[01:26:04 - 01:26:04] they those are all peks
[01:26:04 - 01:26:07] so we have 10 peks
[01:26:07 - 01:26:07] and those peks we have
[01:26:07 - 01:26:11] with two isds one msd
[01:26:11 - 01:26:12] and three charters that we
[01:26:15 - 01:26:15] have with the pek and
[01:26:15 - 01:26:17] with those peks we're working
[01:26:17 - 01:26:18] through collaboratively but more to
[01:26:18 - 01:26:21] that point here's something i'm
[01:26:21 - 01:26:21] sure you will find very
[01:26:21 - 01:26:24] interesting with one of our
[01:26:24 - 01:26:25] isds we're working they don't
[01:26:25 - 01:26:25] have the pek designation but
[01:26:28 - 01:26:28] the purpose is to get
[01:26:28 - 01:26:31] students through and at barbara
[01:26:31 - 01:26:31] jordan right now we are
[01:26:33 - 01:26:33] working with hisd with several
[01:26:33 - 01:26:36] different programs to get students
[01:26:36 - 01:26:38] in to make sure they
[01:26:38 - 01:26:40] complete and besides barbara jordan
[01:26:40 - 01:26:40] and i have to give
[01:26:40 - 01:26:44] a shout out to dr
[01:26:44 - 01:26:44] fortune at north forest we
[01:26:44 - 01:26:45] have north forest high school
[01:26:45 - 01:26:48] we have students being bus
[01:26:48 - 01:26:51] there now for various pek
[01:26:51 - 01:26:51] and cte alignment courses so
[01:26:51 - 01:26:53] to answer your question trusty
[01:26:53 - 01:26:55] chibin we have pek aligned
[01:26:55 - 01:26:58] and set up programs again
[01:26:58 - 01:26:58] with this um with this
[01:26:58 - 01:27:01] particular slide um the early
[01:27:01 - 01:27:03] college is focused more on
[01:27:03 - 01:27:03] academic the pes are for
[01:27:05 - 01:27:07] working on workforce yes i
[01:27:07 - 01:27:07] think if you don't mind
[01:27:07 - 01:27:10] the question that you that
[01:27:10 - 01:27:10] uh trusty sheban is asking
[01:27:11 - 01:27:11] and i know that i've
[01:27:11 - 01:27:13] talked to colleagues out there
[01:27:13 - 01:27:16] more in the charter world
[01:27:16 - 01:27:16] uh there is a lot
[01:27:16 - 01:27:21] of interest in having a
[01:27:21 - 01:27:21] standalone pek college is what
[01:27:23 - 01:27:23] he's referring to no we
[01:27:23 - 01:27:25] don't we don't have that
[01:27:25 - 01:27:25] we have early college but
[01:27:28 - 01:27:28] the need for pek and
[01:27:28 - 01:27:30] i know several uh those
[01:27:30 - 01:27:30] of those leading the charter
[01:27:30 - 01:27:32] of move have tried or
[01:27:32 - 01:27:35] are trying or would like
[01:27:35 - 01:27:35] to chancellor partner with hcc
[01:27:35 - 01:27:37] to have that that at
[01:27:37 - 01:27:40] one of our campuses where
[01:27:40 - 01:27:40] it's a standalone pek uh
[01:27:40 - 01:27:41] academy that's really really important
[01:27:42 - 01:27:44] because it's not just the
[01:27:44 - 01:27:46] the academic piece with the
[01:27:46 - 01:27:48] early college dual credit piece
[01:27:48 - 01:27:48] but it's also that that
[01:27:48 - 01:27:51] pek piece so i'd love
[01:27:51 - 01:27:51] for us to truly work
[01:27:54 - 01:27:54] together with our presidents and
[01:27:54 - 01:27:57] all to to open our
[01:27:57 - 01:27:57] doors to that possibility of
[01:27:59 - 01:27:59] how we can partner with
[01:27:59 - 01:28:00] with folks whether it's isds
[01:28:00 - 01:28:03] or charters or whatever it
[01:28:03 - 01:28:03] may be to see how
[01:28:03 - 01:28:05] we can join together to
[01:28:05 - 01:28:07] do that i i just
[01:28:07 - 01:28:07] i want i'm glad you
[01:28:07 - 01:28:08] brought that up because right
[01:28:08 - 01:28:10] now we are currently working
[01:28:10 - 01:28:12] with aldine high school and
[01:28:12 - 01:28:15] they're trying to create their
[01:28:15 - 01:28:15] first pek for health sciences
[01:28:17 - 01:28:17] along with with dr harrison
[01:28:17 - 01:28:19] we've been meeting with dr
[01:28:19 - 01:28:22] harrison and with memorial herman
[01:28:22 - 01:28:22] i'm sure all of you
[01:28:23 - 01:28:23] heard about the funding that
[01:28:24 - 01:28:26] aldine received from bloomberg the
[01:28:26 - 01:28:29] idea is that that it
[01:28:29 - 01:28:29] the focus of that school
[01:28:29 - 01:28:32] is basically health sciences and
[01:28:32 - 01:28:34] it's it's a new facility
[01:28:34 - 01:28:37] they're creating a new building
[01:28:37 - 01:28:37] and they've asked hc to
[01:28:37 - 01:28:39] partner with them so we're
[01:28:39 - 01:28:41] working with them and um
[01:28:41 - 01:28:41] and hopefully we'll get that
[01:28:43 - 01:28:43] running i think we're shooting
[01:28:43 - 01:28:43] for running i think we're
[01:28:43 - 01:28:45] shooting for spring spring yes
[01:28:45 - 01:28:45] sometime in spring to hopefully
[01:28:48 - 01:28:48] start some classes out at
[01:28:48 - 01:28:50] that location but it will
[01:28:50 - 01:28:50] be a early college high
[01:28:52 - 01:28:55] school but for pek pek
[01:28:55 - 01:28:56] thank you dr anything else
[01:28:56 - 01:28:57] trusty sheep that was it

[01:29:05 - 01:29:08] sure um again thank you
[01:29:08 - 01:29:08] for the presentation and also
[01:29:11 - 01:29:11] uh in seeing our early
[01:29:11 - 01:29:14] colleges they've been very successful
[01:29:14 - 01:29:17] and i know that they're
[01:29:17 - 01:29:17] always having a waiting line
[01:29:17 - 01:29:19] uh to get in and
[01:29:19 - 01:29:20] so that speaks very highly
[01:29:22 - 01:29:22] of it and so some
[01:29:22 - 01:29:22] of us get phone calls
[01:29:23 - 01:29:23] and see if we have
[01:29:23 - 01:29:26] any direct connections to get
[01:29:26 - 01:29:30] their students in their family
[01:29:30 - 01:29:30] members and so uh we
[01:29:30 - 01:29:32] just need to keep making
[01:29:32 - 01:29:35] it challenging exciting and letting
[01:29:35 - 01:29:37] them know that this is
[01:29:37 - 01:29:37] you know this is when

[01:31:01 - 01:31:04] board chair trustees and chancellor
[01:31:06 - 01:31:06] this report is just a
[01:31:06 - 01:31:08] very brief update about our
[01:31:08 - 01:31:10] intention to offer discounted mass
[01:31:10 - 01:31:10] transit fair through the new
[01:31:10 - 01:31:13] ride metro program there is
[01:31:13 - 01:31:16] a current qard program offered
[01:31:16 - 01:31:18] through metro it's slightly different
[01:31:18 - 01:31:21] terms and conditions than what
[01:31:21 - 01:31:24] we're moving to we were
[01:31:24 - 01:31:24] hoping that we could launch
[01:31:24 - 01:31:26] in late september early early
[01:31:26 - 01:31:29] october it may be november
[01:31:29 - 01:31:29] by the time we actually
[01:31:31 - 01:31:31] see metro step up to
[01:31:31 - 01:31:33] their expected launch date uh
[01:31:33 - 01:31:33] they don't have a date
[01:31:35 - 01:31:35] certain yet and i just
[01:31:35 - 01:31:37] checked on it yesterday meanwhile
[01:31:37 - 01:31:39] students we have a volume
[01:31:39 - 01:31:39] of the old q card
[01:31:39 - 01:31:41] that was distributed in previous
[01:31:41 - 01:31:43] years and it's now being
[01:31:43 - 01:31:45] resupplied we have about 2
[01:31:45 - 01:31:45] 000 of those cards to
[01:31:45 - 01:31:48] be distributed across all campuses
[01:31:48 - 01:31:51] this card contains 0 for
[01:31:51 - 01:31:51] free trips which is part
[01:31:51 - 01:31:53] of the new terms and
[01:31:53 - 01:31:55] conditions of the ride metro
[01:31:55 - 01:31:55] program but it does still
[01:31:55 - 01:32:00] have the 50 te fair
[01:32:00 - 01:32:00] discount so it was no
[01:32:02 - 01:32:02] cost to us and it
[01:32:02 - 01:32:02] still is no cost to
[01:32:02 - 01:32:05] us until we bridge into
[01:32:05 - 01:32:07] that new program um it's
[01:32:07 - 01:32:07] under the contract is under
[01:32:09 - 01:32:09] review by general counsel um
[01:32:09 - 01:32:11] we've shown you the flyer
[01:32:11 - 01:32:13] to promote it everyone's pretty
[01:32:13 - 01:32:15] excited about it we also
[01:32:15 - 01:32:15] have a very detailed implementation
[01:32:17 - 01:32:17] plan to asssure that since
[01:32:17 - 01:32:19] the new cards will have
[01:32:19 - 01:32:19] a dollar value built into
[01:32:21 - 01:32:21] them almost 5 you'll see
[01:32:21 - 01:32:23] it on another slide we
[01:32:23 - 01:32:23] want to make sure that
[01:32:25 - 01:32:25] they're secure when we receive
[01:32:25 - 01:32:27] them and secure as they
[01:32:27 - 01:32:30] are distributed we also have
[01:32:30 - 01:32:30] a plan to ensure that
[01:32:30 - 01:32:32] only students receive the cards
[01:32:32 - 01:32:34] so they don't disappear in
[01:32:34 - 01:32:34] other ways and we have
[01:32:34 - 01:32:36] a kind of a clever
[01:32:36 - 01:32:36] way to do that kind
[01:32:36 - 01:32:37] of a clever way to
[01:32:37 - 01:32:40] do that electronically electronically so
[01:32:40 - 01:32:40] we looked at several different
[01:32:40 - 01:32:41] views of the cost for
[01:32:41 - 01:32:44] this we started out with
[01:32:44 - 01:32:44] a 69 000 cost we
[01:32:44 - 01:32:46] felt that was too expensive
[01:32:46 - 01:32:46] for us given our budget
[01:32:49 - 01:32:49] constraints for fy26 we wound
[01:32:49 - 01:32:52] up with 300 3 446
[01:32:54 - 01:32:54] cards that would be distributed
[01:32:54 - 01:32:57] across all six brick-and-mortar campuses
[01:32:57 - 01:32:59] uh based on the colleg's
[01:32:59 - 01:33:01] projected needs we work with
[01:33:01 - 01:33:02] the colleges to determine what
[01:33:02 - 01:33:02] they need the cards would
[01:33:02 - 01:33:04] be distributed for the fall
[01:33:04 - 01:33:08] and spring semesters the cost
[01:33:08 - 01:33:08] went from 69 000 to
[01:33:11 - 01:33:11] roughly 23 000 and there
[01:33:11 - 01:33:12] would be uh several free
[01:33:12 - 01:33:12] trips on the card just
[01:33:12 - 01:33:14] to kind of wet the
[01:33:14 - 01:33:17] appetite of the student to
[01:33:17 - 01:33:17] start using the card roughly
[01:33:17 - 01:33:19] 5 per card as you
[01:33:19 - 01:33:19] can see there with a
[01:33:19 - 01:33:22] 2 activation cost we also
[01:33:22 - 01:33:24] built in just because we
[01:33:24 - 01:33:25] are conscious of education and
[01:33:25 - 01:33:25] how important it is we're
[01:33:25 - 01:33:28] saying you need to have
[01:33:28 - 01:33:28] at least at least 66
[01:33:31 - 01:33:31] credit hours built in or
[01:33:31 - 01:33:32] 80 contact hours we won't
[01:33:32 - 01:33:32] give it for less than
[01:33:32 - 01:33:33] hours we won't give it
[01:33:34 - 01:33:34] for less than that that
[01:33:36 - 01:33:36] and then we'll maintain contact
[01:33:36 - 01:33:37] and collaborate with metro during
[01:33:37 - 01:33:39] the transition period and we
[01:33:39 - 01:33:41] i do keep in touch
[01:33:41 - 01:33:41] with them periodically to see
[01:33:41 - 01:33:43] if things are moving along
[01:33:43 - 01:33:46] any sooner now students once
[01:33:46 - 01:33:46] that 4 80 is used
[01:33:46 - 01:33:48] up on the ride metro
[01:33:48 - 01:33:48] card they can add to
[01:33:48 - 01:33:50] the card so it will
[01:33:50 - 01:33:50] be a card they keep
[01:33:52 - 01:33:52] they don't it's not temporary
[01:33:52 - 01:33:53] it's a card they keep
[01:33:53 - 01:33:53] and can add to and
[01:33:55 - 01:33:55] continue to get a discount
[01:33:55 - 01:33:58] as a matter of fact
[01:33:58 - 01:33:58] on the 10th ride after
[01:33:58 - 01:34:00] 10 trips i believe they
[01:34:00 - 01:34:00] get one free trip that's
[01:34:02 - 01:34:02] what the flyer looks like
[01:34:02 - 01:34:05] the various colleges and cos
[01:34:05 - 01:34:07] have this and are distributing
[01:34:07 - 01:34:07] it although we know that
[01:34:11 - 01:34:11] this is yet to be
[01:34:11 - 01:34:13] realized by metro happy to
[01:34:13 - 01:34:13] answer any questions at all
[01:34:14 - 01:34:14] thank you thank you for
[01:34:14 - 01:34:17] that update any questions or
[01:34:17 - 01:34:18] comments colleagues no thank you
[01:34:19 - 01:34:20] my pleasure appreciate that appreciate
[01:34:21 - 01:34:23] that oh oh we have
[01:34:23 - 01:34:26] someone yes trusty reichart yes
[01:34:26 - 01:34:27] trusty reichart hi hi hi
[01:34:28 - 01:34:31] hi hi what can you
[01:34:31 - 01:34:31] compare it to what we
[01:34:31 - 01:34:31] had what can you compare
[01:34:31 - 01:34:32] it to what we had
[01:34:32 - 01:34:36] before before sure sure it
[01:34:36 - 01:34:36] it's sort of uh here's
[01:34:38 - 01:34:38] it's a sort of a
[01:34:38 - 01:34:41] semantic difference if you will
[01:34:41 - 01:34:41] before we were considered card
[01:34:44 - 01:34:44] distributors so students got the
[01:34:44 - 01:34:47] same 50 discount students could
[01:34:47 - 01:34:49] get the card it had
[01:34:49 - 01:34:49] no value on it but
[01:34:49 - 01:34:53] they got a break on
[01:34:53 - 01:34:53] the fair right now metro
[01:34:53 - 01:34:56] in order to make some
[01:34:56 - 01:34:58] revenue is calling us sponsors
[01:34:58 - 01:34:58] and in order to be
[01:34:58 - 01:35:00] sponsors we have to give
[01:35:00 - 01:35:02] them some revenue and that's
[01:35:02 - 01:35:02] what the 4 80 per
[01:35:02 - 01:35:04] card represents several free trips
[01:35:04 - 01:35:06] each trip would be 120
[01:35:06 - 01:35:08] which is the 50 discounted
[01:35:08 - 01:35:08] fair so we're giving the
[01:35:11 - 01:35:11] students a little teaser free
[01:35:11 - 01:35:13] trip several free trips and
[01:35:13 - 01:35:15] then students would add to
[01:35:15 - 01:35:15] the card as they might
[01:35:15 - 01:35:17] have done previously with the
[01:35:17 - 01:35:20] old card so students still
[01:35:20 - 01:35:20] benefit at the same rate
[01:35:22 - 01:35:22] it's just that this is
[01:35:22 - 01:35:25] now costing the college system
[01:35:25 - 01:35:25] 23 000 a year whereas
[01:35:28 - 01:35:28] before we had zero cost
[01:35:31 - 01:35:31] uh i would just like
[01:35:31 - 01:35:33] to emphasize uh and ask
[01:35:33 - 01:35:33] the administration to please keep
[01:35:36 - 01:35:36] the trustees in mind since
[01:35:36 - 01:35:38] our previous arrangement that was
[01:35:38 - 01:35:41] cheaper for the college fell
[01:35:41 - 01:35:41] apart if there's ever a
[01:35:44 - 01:35:44] time where you can't hold
[01:35:44 - 01:35:46] on to something like that
[01:35:46 - 01:35:48] that the trustees have lots
[01:35:48 - 01:35:48] of connections in metro we
[01:35:51 - 01:35:51] have a lot of work
[01:35:51 - 01:35:51] that we do um with
[01:35:54 - 01:35:54] people associated with metro and
[01:35:54 - 01:35:56] so that is something that
[01:35:56 - 01:35:56] we can step in and
[01:35:59 - 01:35:59] advocate for our students if
[01:35:59 - 01:36:01] necessary so i just ask
[01:36:01 - 01:36:01] that you please keep us
[01:36:04 - 01:36:04] apprised if you know if
[01:36:04 - 01:36:06] you're unable to hold on
[01:36:06 - 01:36:06] to a benefit that our
[01:36:06 - 01:36:09] students have um to to
[01:36:09 - 01:36:09] keep us apprised and and
[01:36:11 - 01:36:11] in the loop and hopefully
[01:36:11 - 01:36:14] we can we can try
[01:36:14 - 01:36:14] to uh bring something like
[01:36:14 - 01:36:16] that uh and hopefully we
[01:36:16 - 01:36:16] can do something in the
[01:36:19 - 01:36:19] future to make things uh
[01:36:19 - 01:36:21] cheaper for the the college
[01:36:21 - 01:36:23] thankfully it won't increase prices
[01:36:23 - 01:36:25] for the students but you
[01:36:25 - 01:36:25] know it is an expense
[01:36:25 - 01:36:26] it is money that we
[01:36:26 - 01:36:26] could be spending on other
[01:36:27 - 01:36:29] things thank you absolutely thank
[01:36:29 - 01:36:32] you thank you anything else

[01:37:37 - 01:37:37] for what you do and
[01:37:39 - 01:37:39] thank you for the the
[01:37:39 - 01:37:41] opportunity to share that information
[01:37:41 - 01:37:43] uh career services afford students
[01:37:43 - 01:37:45] an opportunity to do uh
[01:37:45 - 01:37:50] connect with employers to include
[01:37:50 - 01:37:50] uh events uh taking career
[01:37:54 - 01:37:54] services uh opportunities to engage
[01:37:54 - 01:37:55] with employers and and that's
[01:37:55 - 01:37:58] what we want to talk
[01:37:58 - 01:37:58] a bit about today career
[01:37:58 - 01:38:01] hub is one of the
[01:38:01 - 01:38:01] tools that we use to
[01:38:01 - 01:38:02] let us know what's happening
[01:38:02 - 01:38:11] with our students career hub
[01:38:11 - 01:38:13] utilization is what we're sharing
[01:38:13 - 01:38:13] with you today and we're
[01:38:17 - 01:38:17] identifying from 2022 to 2023
[01:38:17 - 01:38:19] through 24 2025 the experiences
[01:38:19 - 01:38:22] our students have had through
[01:38:22 - 01:38:22] the use of career career
[01:38:22 - 01:38:24] hub and you see the
[01:38:24 - 01:38:24] unique login and this is
[01:38:26 - 01:38:26] our students actually logging into
[01:38:26 - 01:38:28] the system the career services
[01:38:28 - 01:38:31] i mean the career services
[01:38:31 - 01:38:32] uh hub 14 000 students
[01:38:34 - 01:38:34] roughly logging in that's from
[01:38:34 - 01:38:37] from the 8600 number to
[01:38:37 - 01:38:41] 14 000 is about a
[01:38:41 - 01:38:44] 49 difference so that's that's
[01:38:44 - 01:38:44] been increasing over time uh
[01:38:46 - 01:38:46] resume loads so our students
[01:38:46 - 01:38:48] are engaging with employers we're
[01:38:48 - 01:38:51] helping them develop their resumes
[01:38:51 - 01:38:55] and you see the numbers
[01:38:55 - 01:38:55] there are 43 54 and
[01:38:55 - 01:38:59] 25 24 25 and that's
[01:38:59 - 01:39:08] the the the difference kiosk
[01:39:08 - 01:39:08] touch points and you're familiar
[01:39:11 - 01:39:11] with touch uh uh kiosk
[01:39:11 - 01:39:14] our students are going and
[01:39:14 - 01:39:14] logging into to kiosk about
[01:39:16 - 01:39:16] 17 000 students have done
[01:39:16 - 01:39:19] that for the 24 period
[01:39:19 - 01:39:19] up from the 10 000
[01:39:19 - 01:39:23] that you see in the
[01:39:23 - 01:39:23] 22 23 period again this
[01:39:23 - 01:39:27] is utilization of our career
[01:39:27 - 01:39:30] hub service um relatively flat
[01:39:30 - 01:39:32] on the student appointment requests
[01:39:36 - 01:39:36] uh the number the high
[01:39:36 - 01:39:39] number is 34 34 2471
[01:39:39 - 01:39:41] and 2425 and job applications
[01:39:41 - 01:39:43] that affords our students an
[01:39:43 - 01:39:45] opportunity to upload their their
[01:39:45 - 01:39:45] applications uh was higher in
[01:39:45 - 01:39:50] the 2324 period slightly down
[01:39:50 - 01:39:50] to 10 uh 36 2324
[01:39:50 - 01:39:51] period slightly down to 10
[01:39:51 - 01:39:55] uh 36 1036 1036 363
[01:39:55 - 01:39:55] which is roughly a difference
[01:39:55 - 01:39:58] of 363 which is roughly
[01:39:59 - 01:40:03] a difference of 6 2
[01:40:05 - 01:40:05] career hub utilization from an
[01:40:05 - 01:40:07] employer perspective and so employers
[01:40:07 - 01:40:12] and career hub registrations are
[01:40:12 - 01:40:14] down just a little uh
[01:40:14 - 01:40:19] about from 2024 was 867
[01:40:19 - 01:40:23] that's the high and in
[01:40:23 - 01:40:27] 2024 25 was 712 job
[01:40:27 - 01:40:27] postings were higher in the
[01:40:27 - 01:40:30] 2022 233 period and slightly
[01:40:30 - 01:40:30] down to 1 700 in
[01:40:30 - 01:40:35] the 25 2425 period employer
[01:40:35 - 01:40:37] signups this is where employers
[01:40:37 - 01:40:37] are coming on our campus
[01:40:37 - 01:40:39] and and engaging with our
[01:40:39 - 01:40:42] students you see that number
[01:40:42 - 01:40:42] has increased and so we're
[01:40:43 - 01:40:43] delighted to see that number
[01:40:43 - 01:40:52] come from of experiential learning
[01:40:52 - 01:40:55] experiences it's slightly relatively flat
[01:40:55 - 01:41:04] for the uh hi and
[01:41:04 - 01:41:04] i usually don't do this
[01:41:04 - 01:41:05] but hi and i usually
[01:41:05 - 01:41:05] don't do this but yes
[01:41:05 - 01:41:07] yes if you go back
[01:41:07 - 01:41:07] to slide two if you
[01:41:07 - 01:41:07] go back to slide two
[01:41:07 - 01:41:09] two two on the job
[01:41:09 - 01:41:11] adopt applications and you may
[01:41:11 - 01:41:11] have addressed it and i
[01:41:11 - 01:41:13] and i missed it for
[01:41:13 - 01:41:13] a moment to to check
[01:41:13 - 01:41:15] something to my right but
[01:41:15 - 01:41:15] what do you attribute that
[01:41:18 - 01:41:18] decrease in job applications to
[01:41:18 - 01:41:19] let let me if you
[01:41:19 - 01:41:19] don't mind to rely on
[01:41:19 - 01:41:22] a resource here james if
[01:41:22 - 01:41:25] you don't mind coming forward
[01:41:36 - 01:41:37] okay good afternoon adam good
[01:41:37 - 01:41:40] afternoon um your question oh
[01:41:40 - 01:41:42] sorry your question about the
[01:41:42 - 01:41:45] job applications those numbers going
[01:41:45 - 01:41:47] down uh there are varying
[01:41:47 - 01:41:47] factors to what's happening when
[01:41:49 - 01:41:49] students log into careerhub they're
[01:41:51 - 01:41:51] going in to schedule appointments
[01:41:51 - 01:41:54] apply for jobs jobs are
[01:41:54 - 01:41:56] being posted obviously by companies
[01:41:56 - 01:41:56] and as you see in
[01:41:58 - 01:41:58] the data the number of
[01:41:58 - 01:42:00] registrations has been if anything
[01:42:00 - 01:42:02] going down slightly i think
[01:42:02 - 01:42:05] about what's happening economically um
[01:42:05 - 01:42:05] not just in houston but
[01:42:07 - 01:42:07] around the united states that's
[01:42:09 - 01:42:09] impacting how companies are recruiting
[01:42:12 - 01:42:12] talent um that could impact
[01:42:12 - 01:42:13] the companies that are coming
[01:42:13 - 01:42:15] into our system and posting
[01:42:15 - 01:42:18] jobs from time to time
[01:42:18 - 01:42:18] at the same time uh
[01:42:18 - 01:42:20] this is also about companies
[01:42:20 - 01:42:23] posting on a regular basis
[01:42:23 - 01:42:23] in our system and there's
[01:42:23 - 01:42:25] an opportunity to engage those
[01:42:25 - 01:42:27] companies consistently to ensure that
[01:42:27 - 01:42:29] they're posting uh perhaps every
[01:42:29 - 01:42:32] semester uh rather than annually
[01:42:32 - 01:42:34] but i i'd say there
[01:42:34 - 01:42:34] are varying factors to why
[01:42:34 - 01:42:35] those numbers are slightly down
[01:42:38 - 01:42:38] and and i guess the
[01:42:38 - 01:42:38] reason i ask is for
[01:42:40 - 01:42:40] what you said earlier it's
[01:42:40 - 01:42:42] about how are we engaging
[01:42:45 - 01:42:46] uh these potential uh hiring
[01:42:48 - 01:42:48] firms or companies or what
[01:42:48 - 01:42:50] have you to to do
[01:42:50 - 01:42:50] that right to post those
[01:42:53 - 01:42:53] openings and so forth and
[01:42:53 - 01:42:55] and i i think that's
[01:42:55 - 01:42:55] what i was getting at
[01:42:55 - 01:42:57] is that what does that
[01:42:57 - 01:42:57] look like what does that
[01:42:59 - 01:42:59] look like if i'm a
[01:42:59 - 01:43:01] company how are you what
[01:43:01 - 01:43:01] what does that marketing effort
[01:43:05 - 01:43:05] look like uh so that
[01:43:05 - 01:43:05] we can get them to
[01:43:08 - 01:43:08] do this at at greater
[01:43:08 - 01:43:10] numbers so as you i
[01:43:10 - 01:43:10] think here the maybe the
[01:43:10 - 01:43:12] previous slide it was focused
[01:43:12 - 01:43:15] on employer careerhub from an
[01:43:15 - 01:43:16] employer standpoint um you could
[01:43:16 - 01:43:19] see that there were hundreds
[01:43:19 - 01:43:19] of companies that posted um
[01:43:21 - 01:43:21] created accounts in our system
[01:43:23 - 01:43:23] we engage those companies in
[01:43:23 - 01:43:25] our system about posting jobs
[01:43:25 - 01:43:27] periodic updates reminding them about
[01:43:27 - 01:43:28] our career fairs our career
[01:43:28 - 01:43:30] fairs are stretched from september
[01:43:30 - 01:43:30] all the way through april
[01:43:30 - 01:43:32] of next year every year
[01:43:32 - 01:43:34] so part of that engagement
[01:43:34 - 01:43:34] is not just attending career
[01:43:36 - 01:43:36] fairs but it's also posting
[01:43:36 - 01:43:38] jobs posting internships and so
[01:43:38 - 01:43:40] there's an internal campaign engaging
[01:43:40 - 01:43:42] those organizations to post with
[01:43:42 - 01:43:44] us at the same time
[01:43:44 - 01:43:44] as you saw in the
[01:43:44 - 01:43:46] data we're also looking for
[01:43:46 - 01:43:48] ways to have companies come
[01:43:48 - 01:43:48] on site and conduct interviews
[01:43:48 - 01:43:50] and you may have seen
[01:43:50 - 01:43:50] here in the data that
[01:43:52 - 01:43:52] that number has gone up
[01:43:52 - 01:43:53] tremendously in the past couple
[01:43:53 - 01:43:56] of years we're wanting to
[01:43:56 - 01:43:58] emphasize companies conducting interviews not
[01:43:58 - 01:44:01] just posting jobs and if
[01:44:01 - 01:44:01] you can imagine in general
[01:44:01 - 01:44:03] in the world of work
[01:44:03 - 01:44:05] how companies recruit is changing
[01:44:05 - 01:44:05] uh companies may have gone
[01:44:05 - 01:44:07] to zip recruit or indeed
[01:44:07 - 01:44:09] or posted on linkedin or
[01:44:09 - 01:44:09] posted in a job board
[01:44:09 - 01:44:11] but we're also realizing that
[01:44:11 - 01:44:14] companies are curating their own
[01:44:14 - 01:44:16] networking opportunities that affords us
[01:44:16 - 01:44:18] an opportunity to engage them
[01:44:18 - 01:44:21] to come on campus or
[01:44:21 - 01:44:21] to conduct on uh virtual
[01:44:23 - 01:44:23] opportunities as well um as
[01:44:23 - 01:44:26] i mentioned varying factors into
[01:44:26 - 01:44:29] why the number of job
[01:44:29 - 01:44:30] postings have gone down why
[01:44:30 - 01:44:30] the number of course applications
[01:44:33 - 01:44:33] have gone down tied to
[01:44:33 - 01:44:35] job postings uh but we
[01:44:35 - 01:44:37] can do more obviously oh
[01:44:37 - 01:44:37] we've we look at okay
[01:44:37 - 01:44:40] the employers who's posting who's
[01:44:40 - 01:44:42] hiring um you know who
[01:44:42 - 01:44:42] needs to drop off or
[01:44:45 - 01:44:45] or what do we need
[01:44:45 - 01:44:47] to do more because you're
[01:44:47 - 01:44:47] not posting enough you're not
[01:44:48 - 01:44:48] interviewing our students you're not
[01:44:50 - 01:44:50] so we're we're tracking all
[01:44:50 - 01:44:51] of that so we're we're
[01:44:51 - 01:44:51] tracking all of that correct
[01:44:51 - 01:44:52] correct yes and and i
[01:44:52 - 01:44:52] want you to know there's
[01:44:54 - 01:44:54] over 8 000 contacts in
[01:44:54 - 01:44:54] our system over 8 000
[01:44:54 - 01:44:55] contacts in our system yes
[01:44:55 - 01:44:58] yes we're engaging them as
[01:44:58 - 01:45:00] a whole all the time
[01:45:00 - 01:45:00] and as you mentioned um
[01:45:00 - 01:45:02] some of them are actively
[01:45:02 - 01:45:04] involved in posting with us
[01:45:04 - 01:45:06] coming on campus participating in
[01:45:06 - 01:45:09] career fairs conducting interviews and
[01:45:09 - 01:45:09] others are it just changes
[01:45:09 - 01:45:11] if you could imagine you
[01:45:11 - 01:45:12] have people behind the scenes
[01:45:12 - 01:45:14] that are creating these accounts
[01:45:14 - 01:45:14] these people change from month
[01:45:16 - 01:45:16] to month they leave their
[01:45:16 - 01:45:17] roles go to another company
[01:45:17 - 01:45:17] and so there's quite an
[01:45:20 - 01:45:20] operation behind the scenes to
[01:45:20 - 01:45:21] keep track of all those
[01:45:21 - 01:45:23] contacts to ensure that they're
[01:45:23 - 01:45:25] relevant uh that they're still
[01:45:25 - 01:45:25] working in their roles that
[01:45:25 - 01:45:26] when we're sending emails is
[01:45:26 - 01:45:27] it really going to someone
[01:45:27 - 01:45:27] is it going just to
[01:45:27 - 01:45:30] an automatic reply or is
[01:45:30 - 01:45:31] it undeliverable because then that
[01:45:31 - 01:45:33] person doesn't work there anymore
[01:45:33 - 01:45:33] then we follow with the
[01:45:35 - 01:45:35] company to find out who
[01:45:35 - 01:45:37] is the new point of
[01:45:37 - 01:45:37] contact that we can add
[01:45:37 - 01:45:39] into our system continuing that
[01:45:39 - 01:45:40] engagement so it's quite an
[01:45:40 - 01:45:42] operation when we talk about
[01:45:42 - 01:45:42] 8 000 contacts in our
[01:45:42 - 01:45:45] system absolutely absolutely thank you
[01:45:45 - 01:45:45] thank absolutely absolutely thank you
[01:45:46 - 01:45:47] thank you you you okay
[01:45:47 - 01:45:50] okay uh data well one
[01:45:50 - 01:45:50] of the things that we
[01:45:51 - 01:45:51] talked about here trustee was
[01:45:52 - 01:45:53] the opportunity here what are
[01:45:53 - 01:45:54] the pain points and that
[01:45:54 - 01:45:54] was one of the things
[01:45:56 - 01:45:56] that you lifted up so
[01:45:56 - 01:45:58] there there's a whole apparatus
[01:45:58 - 01:46:00] that's that's working here behind
[01:46:00 - 01:46:01] the scenes that's that's bigger
[01:46:01 - 01:46:01] than what you see in
[01:46:01 - 01:46:03] these numbers necessarily and so
[01:46:03 - 01:46:05] improving upon those things and
[01:46:05 - 01:46:07] we identify the opportunity to
[01:46:07 - 01:46:09] improve upon these things is
[01:46:09 - 01:46:09] is the is the challenge
[01:46:09 - 01:46:11] but it's also the opportunity
[01:46:11 - 01:46:11] and so we have the
[01:46:13 - 01:46:13] right people in place to
[01:46:13 - 01:46:16] be able to do that
[01:46:16 - 01:46:16] um as just a little
[01:46:16 - 01:46:19] more data with respect to
[01:46:19 - 01:46:19] career fairs and these are

[01:46:25 - 01:46:28] career fairs about 3 200
[01:46:28 - 01:46:30] students participating in just a
[01:46:30 - 01:46:33] little over 300 employers participating
[01:46:33 - 01:46:33] in those activities and u
[01:46:35 - 01:46:35] this is just a depiction
[01:46:35 - 01:46:35] of of of one of
[01:46:39 - 01:46:39] of the 25 26 uh
[01:46:39 - 01:46:41] events that were held during
[01:46:41 - 01:46:41] that time period some of
[01:46:41 - 01:46:43] the participants during the deep
[01:46:43 - 01:46:44] time period you see are

[01:46:50 - 01:46:52] representative example of the healthcare
[01:46:52 - 01:46:54] industry um just wanted to
[01:46:54 - 01:46:54] give the board a sense
[01:46:54 - 01:46:56] of the types of folks
[01:46:56 - 01:46:57] that we're having an opportunity
[01:46:57 - 01:46:57] to engage and for our

[01:46:59 - 01:47:01] with their on their journey
[01:47:01 - 01:47:03] to employment and so we're
[01:47:03 - 01:47:03] we're looking at students who
[01:47:03 - 01:47:04] are working with us and
[01:47:04 - 01:47:06] we'll talk a little bit
[01:47:06 - 01:47:06] about that on the end
[01:47:06 - 01:47:08] so just wanted to share
[01:47:08 - 01:47:08] that with you a campus

[01:47:18 - 01:47:18] students about 2 000 students
[01:47:18 - 01:47:22] were surveyed at graduation to
[01:47:22 - 01:47:23] identify what percentage of them
[01:47:23 - 01:47:25] were employed full-time uh at
[01:47:25 - 01:47:27] the time that they graduated
[01:47:27 - 01:47:27] and you see the numbers
[01:47:27 - 01:47:31] here respectively are 25 uh
[01:47:31 - 01:47:33] uh uh for uh employed
[01:47:33 - 01:47:35] full-time students 22 were employed
[01:47:35 - 01:47:37] part-time said they were employed
[01:47:37 - 01:47:40] part-time unemployed seeking employment 34
[01:47:40 - 01:47:43] unemployed seeking employment unemployed not
[01:47:43 - 01:47:46] seeking employment which is 19
[01:47:46 - 01:47:49] and seeking a continuing education
[01:47:49 - 01:47:51] program uh we have folks

[01:47:57 - 01:48:01] utilizing the career services uh
[01:48:01 - 01:48:03] hub here is 66 so
[01:48:03 - 01:48:03] that's an opportunity for us
[01:48:03 - 01:48:05] to get out engage with
[01:48:05 - 01:48:06] these students to make sure
[01:48:06 - 01:48:06] that they're aware that we
[01:48:06 - 01:48:08] have opportunities that afford them
[01:48:08 - 01:48:10] an opportunity to to go
[01:48:10 - 01:48:12] go to work if that's
[01:48:12 - 01:48:12] what they desire to do

[01:48:31 - 01:48:31] i saved the best for
[01:48:31 - 01:48:39] last so opportunities increase campus
[01:48:41 - 01:48:41] interviews that's i think the
[01:48:41 - 01:48:43] data tells us that promote

[01:56:02 - 01:56:04] afternoon trustees uh i just
[01:56:04 - 01:56:05] want to take a minute
[01:56:05 - 01:56:05] at the very beginning of
[01:56:05 - 01:56:07] this as we were putting
[01:56:07 - 01:56:08] this report together gave us
[01:56:08 - 01:56:08] an opportunity to kind of
[01:56:10 - 01:56:10] reflect on where we've come
[01:56:10 - 01:56:12] over the last year and
[01:56:12 - 01:56:12] i i think when you
[01:56:12 - 01:56:14] look through this report you
[01:56:14 - 01:56:15] can see the tremendous amount
[01:56:15 - 01:56:18] of work that's been done
[01:56:18 - 01:56:18] by our facilities department to
[01:56:18 - 01:56:20] put in place a consistent
[01:56:20 - 01:56:22] process for managing of our
[01:56:22 - 01:56:24] deferred maintenance projecting out what
[01:56:24 - 01:56:26] those expenses are going to
[01:56:26 - 01:56:26] be in future years and
[01:56:26 - 01:56:27] really monitoring how effective we're
[01:56:27 - 01:56:30] going to be um there's
[01:56:30 - 01:56:30] a lot of data in
[01:56:30 - 01:56:31] this report i'm going to
[01:56:31 - 01:56:33] ask james walker our interim
[01:56:33 - 01:56:35] chief facilities officer to walk
[01:56:35 - 01:56:35] through it um and just
[01:56:35 - 01:56:47] highlight madame chair trustees madam
[01:56:50 - 01:56:52] chancellor thank you so we
[01:56:52 - 01:56:52] want to we wanted to
[01:56:52 - 01:56:54] give this report an overview
[01:56:54 - 01:56:56] to focus on uh preventative
[01:56:56 - 01:56:59] maintenance and and monitoring systems
[01:56:59 - 01:57:02] deferred maintenance uh for fy25
[01:57:02 - 01:57:02] and deferred maintenance for uh
[01:57:02 - 01:57:05] for fy25 and deferred maintenance
[01:57:06 - 01:57:10] for fy26 um touching on
[01:57:10 - 01:57:10] risk a bit um the
[01:57:10 - 01:57:12] the biggest risk on on
[01:57:12 - 01:57:16] deferred maintenance is need exceeding
[01:57:16 - 01:57:20] available budget um you know
[01:57:20 - 01:57:20] it can erode um degrade
[01:57:20 - 01:57:22] campus campus experience and then
[01:57:22 - 01:57:31] it affect uh a little
[01:57:31 - 01:57:33] bit about uh mitigation we'll
[01:57:33 - 01:57:33] get into more of this
[01:57:33 - 01:57:35] later but uh we use
[01:57:35 - 01:57:37] preventative maintenance to maximize the
[01:57:37 - 01:57:40] life of building systems and
[01:57:40 - 01:57:40] equipment um we use it
[01:57:40 - 01:57:43] for prioritization of projects and
[01:57:43 - 01:57:51] we use it all right
[01:57:51 - 01:57:51] getting a little bit deeper
[01:57:55 - 01:57:55] into the mitigation strategy we
[01:57:55 - 01:58:00] use uh preventative maintenance and
[01:58:00 - 01:58:00] system monitoring you know in
[01:58:00 - 01:58:02] in the maintenance world this
[01:58:02 - 01:58:04] is where the the rubber
[01:58:04 - 01:58:04] really hits the road on
[01:58:04 - 01:58:07] on what we do here
[01:58:07 - 01:58:10] um deferred maintenance plan was
[01:58:10 - 01:58:13] implemented to um replace obsolete
[01:58:13 - 01:58:16] equipment uh we educate constantly
[01:58:16 - 01:58:18] educate staff and vendors leverage
[01:58:18 - 01:58:23] technology um prioritization for repairs
[01:58:23 - 01:58:25] uh weekly weekly uh visual
[01:58:25 - 01:58:28] inspections we use building automation
[01:58:28 - 01:58:31] work orders outage tracking and
[01:58:31 - 01:58:31] for example to to give
[01:58:32 - 01:58:34] you a few examples of
[01:58:34 - 01:58:38] how this would this works
[01:58:38 - 01:58:38] um this is this is
[01:58:38 - 01:58:41] a screenshot of our building
[01:58:41 - 01:58:45] automation monitoring system so this
[01:58:45 - 01:58:47] is southeast college um the
[01:58:47 - 01:58:48] central plant condenser water system
[01:58:51 - 01:58:51] side of the loop so
[01:58:51 - 01:58:54] what this shows is the
[01:58:54 - 01:58:54] chiller it shows the pumps
[01:58:54 - 01:58:56] it shows the valves it
[01:58:56 - 01:58:58] shows the cooling tower and
[01:58:58 - 01:58:58] the condenser side and in
[01:58:58 - 01:59:00] the blue boxes it gives
[01:59:00 - 01:59:03] you real time information of
[01:59:03 - 01:59:03] what's going on in this
[01:59:05 - 01:59:05] plant for southeast campus on
[01:59:05 - 01:59:08] on this condenser loop and
[01:59:08 - 01:59:08] i also like to point
[01:59:12 - 01:59:12] out that if you look
[01:59:12 - 01:59:15] at the uh example of
[01:59:15 - 01:59:15] the alarm the little red
[01:59:15 - 01:59:18] dot um and that tells
[01:59:18 - 01:59:18] that tells the system that
[01:59:21 - 01:59:21] this this bypass pump is
[01:59:21 - 01:59:25] out of tolerance and it's
[01:59:25 - 01:59:25] then it sends to a
[01:59:27 - 01:59:27] different page which is illustrated
[01:59:27 - 01:59:30] at the bottom that someone
[01:59:30 - 01:59:32] needs to go check on
[01:59:32 - 01:59:32] on that pump because it's
[01:59:32 - 01:59:34] out of tolerance so that's
[01:59:34 - 01:59:35] our building automation monitoring we
[01:59:35 - 01:59:38] have that throughout the entire
[01:59:38 - 01:59:41] system um like to highlight
[01:59:41 - 01:59:43] our work order uh system
[01:59:43 - 01:59:43] which is a different system
[01:59:43 - 01:59:46] in the blue you see
[01:59:46 - 01:59:49] plan maintenance um which is
[01:59:49 - 01:59:49] everyday pms that we go
[01:59:49 - 01:59:52] out and check the equipment
[01:59:52 - 01:59:55] um the team goes out
[01:59:55 - 01:59:55] and does that um then
[01:59:55 - 01:59:56] we have reactive maintenance that's
[01:59:56 - 01:59:58] when something breaks uh and
[01:59:58 - 02:00:01] we have to send somebody
[02:00:01 - 02:00:01] out to address that and
[02:00:01 - 02:00:04] then you you see the
[02:00:04 - 02:00:04] total um for a 12-month
[02:00:07 - 02:00:07] period it's 43 000 work
[02:00:07 - 02:00:10] orders put put into the
[02:00:10 - 02:00:15] system so facilities um tracking
[02:00:15 - 02:00:18] and trending um this is
[02:00:18 - 02:00:18] something we we've started in
[02:00:21 - 02:00:24] december of 2024 um so
[02:00:24 - 02:00:24] we we've got partial data
[02:00:24 - 02:00:28] on this um interruptions are
[02:00:28 - 02:00:34] rated as minor um um
[02:00:37 - 02:00:39] this shows interruptions between december
[02:00:39 - 02:00:39] 24 and july when the
[02:00:39 - 02:00:43] report was done and uh
[02:00:43 - 02:00:46] it shows the systems affected
[02:00:46 - 02:00:46] colleges affected um and if
[02:00:49 - 02:00:49] you know the systems affected
[02:00:49 - 02:00:51] uh fire mechanical electrical things
[02:00:51 - 02:00:53] that are on the top
[02:00:53 - 02:00:53] of the list of our
[02:00:53 - 02:01:04] deferred okay uh now we
[02:01:04 - 02:01:08] move to fy25 update um
[02:01:08 - 02:01:08] this is a 7-year funding
[02:01:08 - 02:01:10] history you're familiar with this
[02:01:10 - 02:01:13] chart we just continue to
[02:01:13 - 02:01:13] add to this um but
[02:01:13 - 02:01:18] i must add the the
[02:01:18 - 02:01:18] the note um that the
[02:01:18 - 02:01:22] year of fy25 or 26
[02:01:22 - 02:01:22] excuse me um the estimated
[02:01:26 - 02:01:26] need was 43 million uh
[02:01:26 - 02:01:28] we got 15 million and
[02:01:28 - 02:01:28] a 10 million amendment in
[02:01:28 - 02:01:31] at the end of 25
[02:01:35 - 02:01:35] um active projects of 25
[02:01:35 - 02:01:37] uh these are multi-year projects
[02:01:37 - 02:01:41] that have long lead times
[02:01:41 - 02:01:41] a lot of design uh
[02:01:41 - 02:01:43] so you'll continue seeing us
[02:01:43 - 02:01:43] add to these and as
[02:01:45 - 02:01:45] we complete them they'll come
[02:01:45 - 02:01:45] off the we complete them
[02:01:45 - 02:01:46] they'll come off the list
[02:01:46 - 02:01:56] list project financials um this
[02:01:56 - 02:01:56] is the same information on
[02:01:56 - 02:01:57] funds by college but it's
[02:01:57 - 02:01:58] just in dollar by college
[02:01:58 - 02:02:00] but it's just in dollar
[02:02:00 - 02:02:04] format format uh exigent spend
[02:02:04 - 02:02:04] so um we propose that
[02:02:08 - 02:02:08] we we are attempting to
[02:02:08 - 02:02:11] stay under 15 of the
[02:02:11 - 02:02:11] total budget for exigent spend
[02:02:15 - 02:02:15] and we we we do
[02:02:15 - 02:02:18] that by our mitigation efforts
[02:02:18 - 02:02:18] that we talked about a
[02:02:18 - 02:02:21] little bit before so um
[02:02:21 - 02:02:23] that's that's the goal to
[02:02:23 - 02:02:23] keep this under 15 but
[02:02:23 - 02:02:27] as you see the trajectory
[02:02:27 - 02:02:27] of as we underfund the
[02:02:30 - 02:02:30] exigent spin goes starts to
[02:02:30 - 02:02:33] go in an upward trajectory
[02:02:35 - 02:02:35] all right so deferred maintenance
[02:02:35 - 02:02:39] uh the fci facilities condition
[02:02:39 - 02:02:40] index um you've seen this
[02:02:40 - 02:02:44] slide before i thought it'd
[02:02:44 - 02:02:44] be helpful to to add
[02:02:44 - 02:02:48] it in again um to
[02:02:48 - 02:02:48] show the 15 million um
[02:02:48 - 02:02:52] investment so we're we're roughly
[02:02:52 - 02:02:55] on the uh green um
[02:02:55 - 02:03:01] the green line moving towards
[02:03:01 - 02:03:01] uh 19 5 in 2030
[02:03:01 - 02:03:04] which is getting to be
[02:03:04 - 02:03:04] average and below average if
[02:03:04 - 02:03:07] we continue with 15 million
[02:03:07 - 02:03:11] a year okay so deferred
[02:03:11 - 02:03:15] maintenance program facil uh fy26
[02:03:15 - 02:03:15] as i mentioned before uh
[02:03:19 - 02:03:19] 15 million for approved in
[02:03:19 - 02:03:22] the in the 26 budget
[02:03:22 - 02:03:22] and 10 million for the
[02:03:22 - 02:03:24] amendment at the end of
[02:03:24 - 02:03:29] 25 thank you for that
[02:03:29 - 02:03:31] um this next slide uh
[02:03:31 - 02:03:34] it illustrates our 10step prioritization
[02:03:34 - 02:03:37] process that we that we
[02:03:37 - 02:03:37] go through um currently we're
[02:03:43 - 02:03:43] on step six and seven
[02:03:43 - 02:03:45] um while we're validating and
[02:03:45 - 02:03:48] finalization of projects for implementation
[02:03:50 - 02:03:50] so the the the annual
[02:03:50 - 02:03:54] assessment summary this this is
[02:03:54 - 02:03:58] just showing the p the
[02:03:58 - 02:03:58] items that were funded in
[02:03:58 - 02:04:02] fy2526 and then the blue
[02:04:02 - 02:04:05] is showing the the items
[02:04:05 - 02:04:05] that will have to be
[02:04:05 - 02:04:07] reassessed and and addressed at
[02:04:07 - 02:04:07] a f in future and
[02:04:08 - 02:04:09] and addressed at a f
[02:04:09 - 02:04:15] in future years years um
[02:04:15 - 02:04:15] this is project budget by
[02:04:15 - 02:04:18] system uh again you see
[02:04:18 - 02:04:21] fire life safety hvac electrical
[02:04:21 - 02:04:21] um that was at the
[02:04:21 - 02:04:23] top of the list for
[02:04:23 - 02:04:26] our interruptions as you see
[02:04:26 - 02:04:26] it's it's heavily um represented
[02:04:26 - 02:04:28] see it's it's heavily um
[02:04:29 - 02:04:34] represented here here um project
[02:04:34 - 02:04:37] breakdown by estimated cost um
[02:04:37 - 02:04:37] we thought it was important
[02:04:37 - 02:04:38] to show um we thought
[02:04:38 - 02:04:39] it was important to show
[02:04:39 - 02:04:41] this this slide because of
[02:04:41 - 02:04:43] the different the difference between
[02:04:43 - 02:04:46] small medium and large projects
[02:04:46 - 02:04:46] as we see not all
[02:04:50 - 02:04:50] projects are large so um
[02:04:50 - 02:04:53] the plan is for the
[02:04:53 - 02:04:53] job order contracts to you
[02:04:53 - 02:04:55] be utilized for the small
[02:04:55 - 02:04:59] and medium projects and then
[02:04:59 - 02:05:01] the large 500 000 projects
[02:05:01 - 02:05:01] and over would come to
[02:05:01 - 02:05:05] the board for their for
[02:05:05 - 02:05:07] their approval um we have
[02:05:07 - 02:05:07] some appendix in the back
[02:05:09 - 02:05:09] these are some definitions you've
[02:05:09 - 02:05:11] seen before i thought they'd
[02:05:11 - 02:05:14] be helpful ranking criteria systems
[02:05:14 - 02:05:17] uh current deficiency list um
[02:05:17 - 02:05:20] where where we're we're using
[02:05:20 - 02:05:20] uh to to generate our
[02:05:20 - 02:05:21] we're using uh to to
[02:05:21 - 02:05:26] generate our projects projects and
[02:05:26 - 02:05:26] summary of maintenance by building
[02:05:26 - 02:05:27] and summary of maintenance by
[02:05:27 - 02:05:30] building um um i think
[02:05:30 - 02:05:30] we you know in in
[02:05:30 - 02:05:34] essence i think we got
[02:05:34 - 02:05:34] a question about um th
[02:05:34 - 02:05:37] this particular slide and and
[02:05:37 - 02:05:41] and i think the answer
[02:05:41 - 02:05:41] is the 20 to 20
[02:05:41 - 02:05:45] 20 22 to through 25
[02:05:45 - 02:05:45] through 2030 is shown on
[02:05:45 - 02:05:50] here and then 25 through
[02:05:50 - 02:05:50] 35 is also shown on
[02:05:50 - 02:05:53] here so in essence we
[02:05:53 - 02:05:53] could use this data um
[02:05:53 - 02:05:57] going on into the to
[02:05:57 - 02:05:57] to the to the future
[02:05:57 - 02:06:00] but the industry standard recommends
[02:06:00 - 02:06:03] that we we um conduct
[02:06:03 - 02:06:06] a new facilities condition assessment
[02:06:06 - 02:06:06] in in 2029 so that
[02:06:06 - 02:06:09] concludes my report uh i'll
[02:06:09 - 02:06:11] be happy to answer any
[02:06:11 - 02:06:14] questions for you thank you
[02:06:14 - 02:06:14] um i do know my
[02:06:14 - 02:06:17] my colleague will have some
[02:06:17 - 02:06:18] questions trusty chap just have
[02:06:18 - 02:06:21] one so appreciate you speaking
[02:06:21 - 02:06:21] to the outy years the
[02:06:21 - 02:06:23] 2030 to 2035 deferred maintenance
[02:06:23 - 02:06:24] um i think it'd be
[02:06:24 - 02:06:24] helpful to understand a bit
[02:06:24 - 02:06:26] more how y'all came up
[02:06:26 - 02:06:28] with those numbers because i
[02:06:28 - 02:06:28] know we haven't yet done
[02:06:28 - 02:06:30] a study to quantify it
[02:06:30 - 02:06:32] so if you've got internal
[02:06:32 - 02:06:32] systems that are tracking and
[02:06:33 - 02:06:33] forecasting organically that would be
[02:06:36 - 02:06:36] helpful to understand um and
[02:06:36 - 02:06:38] and you mentioned so a
[02:06:38 - 02:06:41] that's number one number two
[02:06:41 - 02:06:41] i'm really happy to see
[02:06:41 - 02:06:43] that we do have at
[02:06:43 - 02:06:43] least a swag at what
[02:06:43 - 02:06:45] those deferred maintenance costs look
[02:06:45 - 02:06:46] like in the out years
[02:06:46 - 02:06:46] so that the board can
[02:06:48 - 02:06:48] start getting comfortable with you
[02:06:50 - 02:06:50] know we've got this 400
[02:06:50 - 02:06:52] million um task ahead of
[02:06:52 - 02:06:52] us for the next 5
[02:06:52 - 02:06:54] years it seems like the
[02:06:54 - 02:06:56] next 5 years are currently
[02:06:56 - 02:06:56] forecasted to be not quite
[02:06:56 - 02:06:59] as painful but you know
[02:06:59 - 02:07:00] when we put more meat
[02:07:00 - 02:07:00] on the bones that'll probably
[02:07:00 - 02:07:01] look a little bit worse
[02:07:01 - 02:07:03] than it does currently um
[02:07:03 - 02:07:06] so really pleased that that
[02:07:06 - 02:07:06] number's in there um but
[02:07:06 - 02:07:08] yeah just some some more
[02:07:08 - 02:07:10] information over time with um
[02:07:10 - 02:07:13] the assumptions that went into
[02:07:13 - 02:07:13] that 30 you know 2030
[02:07:13 - 02:07:15] to 2035 number and how
[02:07:15 - 02:07:15] much we can really hang
[02:07:17 - 02:07:17] our hat on it versus
[02:07:17 - 02:07:19] where do we really need
[02:07:19 - 02:07:19] to study to fully flush
[02:07:19 - 02:07:20] it out i think would
[02:07:20 - 02:07:20] be helpful just as we
[02:07:20 - 02:07:23] set start setting expectations there's
[02:07:23 - 02:07:24] a lot of other big
[02:07:24 - 02:07:26] ticket items including you know
[02:07:26 - 02:07:26] erp upgrades and all that
[02:07:26 - 02:07:27] that could be coming in
[02:07:27 - 02:07:28] and we need to stack
[02:07:31 - 02:07:31] all these on top of
[02:07:31 - 02:07:34] one another so so so
[02:07:34 - 02:07:34] yes so um the way
[02:07:34 - 02:07:37] it works in our database
[02:07:37 - 02:07:37] is so if we if
[02:07:37 - 02:07:40] we put a new piece
[02:07:40 - 02:07:40] of equipment in today and
[02:07:40 - 02:07:43] we have a 10 and
[02:07:43 - 02:07:43] it has a 10y year
[02:07:43 - 02:07:47] lifespan um that will show
[02:07:47 - 02:07:47] up in needing to be
[02:07:51 - 02:07:51] replaced in the life cycle
[02:07:51 - 02:07:54] of of uh 20 whatever
[02:07:54 - 02:07:54] 10 years from now so
[02:07:54 - 02:07:56] that's how it's calculated within
[02:07:56 - 02:07:59] the database it's expiring equipment
[02:07:59 - 02:08:01] that goes into deficiency and
[02:08:01 - 02:08:01] that's why we do the
[02:08:01 - 02:08:05] the the the re the
[02:08:05 - 02:08:05] the refresh each year to
[02:08:08 - 02:08:08] make sure that we that
[02:08:08 - 02:08:11] because of budget we have
[02:08:11 - 02:08:11] to push some things out
[02:08:11 - 02:08:14] so um that's how the
[02:08:14 - 02:08:14] database works it it it
[02:08:18 - 02:08:18] looks out um forward to
[02:08:18 - 02:08:20] make sure that uh those
[02:08:20 - 02:08:20] pieces of equipment that are
[02:08:25 - 02:08:25] expiring have some uh have
[02:08:25 - 02:08:25] some value to expiring have
[02:08:25 - 02:08:25] some uh have some value
[02:08:25 - 02:08:26] to them them very helpful
[02:08:26 - 02:08:27] thank you very helpful thank
[02:08:28 - 02:08:32] you mhm mhm trustee reichard
[02:08:32 - 02:08:34] is she there i'm here
[02:08:34 - 02:08:34] no i don't have any
[02:08:35 - 02:08:38] questions thank you okay uh
[02:08:38 - 02:08:38] thank you uh this is
[02:08:38 - 02:08:40] this is this is the
[02:08:40 - 02:08:40] kind of in-depth report that
[02:08:41 - 02:08:41] we were looking for for
[02:08:41 - 02:08:45] deferred maintenance and trying to
[02:08:45 - 02:08:48] make audit decisions or fiscal
[02:08:48 - 02:08:50] decisions concerning what we're going
[02:08:50 - 02:08:50] to do with all of
[02:08:50 - 02:08:52] our properties pluto's on the
[02:08:52 - 02:08:57] deferred maintenance 10step prioritization process
[02:08:57 - 02:08:57] update that is very good
[02:08:57 - 02:08:59] to know uh and i'm
[02:08:59 - 02:08:59] sure you all stay on
[02:09:01 - 02:09:01] task for that but it
[02:09:01 - 02:09:05] is very impressive on page
[02:09:05 - 02:09:08] 8 your facilities work order
[02:09:08 - 02:09:11] update yes ma'am it would
[02:09:11 - 02:09:11] be interesting to know since
[02:09:14 - 02:09:14] this is a rolling 12-month
[02:09:14 - 02:09:17] window what this looked like
[02:09:17 - 02:09:17] 12 months ago are we
[02:09:19 - 02:09:19] are our work orders increasing
[02:09:19 - 02:09:21] or are work orders decreasing
[02:09:21 - 02:09:23] what is that looking like
[02:09:23 - 02:09:25] exactly i i believe we
[02:09:25 - 02:09:25] can run that we can
[02:09:25 - 02:09:26] run that report for you
[02:09:30 - 02:09:30] okay so if we see
[02:09:30 - 02:09:33] it from 2022 to now
[02:09:33 - 02:09:33] we want to see if
[02:09:33 - 02:09:36] the work orders uh are
[02:09:36 - 02:09:40] increasing or decreasing and sometimes
[02:09:40 - 02:09:40] per college one of our
[02:09:42 - 02:09:42] challenges is that we have
[02:09:42 - 02:09:46] buildings that we have had
[02:09:46 - 02:09:47] for five lifetimes and then
[02:09:47 - 02:09:47] we have buildings who are
[02:09:47 - 02:09:49] that are relatively new but
[02:09:49 - 02:09:49] it seems to me as
[02:09:49 - 02:09:51] i read through this that
[02:09:51 - 02:09:52] the buildings that are relatively
[02:09:52 - 02:09:54] new have some deferred maintenance
[02:09:54 - 02:09:57] issues which i think they
[02:09:57 - 02:09:57] should not have but that's
[02:09:59 - 02:09:59] just what i think so
[02:09:59 - 02:10:00] we want to see if
[02:10:02 - 02:10:02] the newer buildings are are
[02:10:02 - 02:10:04] faced with a higher number
[02:10:04 - 02:10:04] of work orders as opposed
[02:10:06 - 02:10:06] to the older buildings i
[02:10:06 - 02:10:07] would think that the older
[02:10:07 - 02:10:09] buildings would have the greater
[02:10:09 - 02:10:09] issues and if they do
[02:10:09 - 02:10:11] not and the new newer
[02:10:11 - 02:10:15] buildings do then what what
[02:10:15 - 02:10:15] is going on with that
[02:10:15 - 02:10:17] um thank you for the
[02:10:17 - 02:10:19] tracking and trending because this
[02:10:19 - 02:10:22] is tracking in december 2024
[02:10:22 - 02:10:22] we have no data prior
[02:10:22 - 02:10:24] to that for for facilities
[02:10:24 - 02:10:24] interruption tracking and for facilities
[02:10:25 - 02:10:25] interruption tracking and trending trending
[02:10:27 - 02:10:27] well we did it in
[02:10:27 - 02:10:29] a different manner that that
[02:10:30 - 02:10:36] wasn't really um presentation friendly
[02:10:36 - 02:10:40] i would say okay so
[02:10:40 - 02:10:43] for a general a general
[02:10:43 - 02:10:43] approach we could see the
[02:10:46 - 02:10:49] total cost for 2023 for
[02:10:49 - 02:10:49] facilities of the the total
[02:10:51 - 02:10:51] facilities tracking for 2023 we
[02:10:51 - 02:10:54] may not have to uh
[02:10:54 - 02:10:54] disagregate it but if we
[02:10:54 - 02:10:57] see it we'll understand building
[02:10:59 - 02:10:59] interruptions and what that looked
[02:10:59 - 02:11:01] like in 2023 and what
[02:11:01 - 02:11:02] it looks like in 2024
[02:11:05 - 02:11:05] these uh graphs should give
[02:11:05 - 02:11:09] us a general idea of
[02:11:09 - 02:11:09] which way we're trending and
[02:11:09 - 02:11:11] how because when you start
[02:11:11 - 02:11:14] to stack the the uh
[02:11:14 - 02:11:14] graphs on top of each
[02:11:14 - 02:11:15] other there are some pinpoints
[02:11:15 - 02:11:18] that you can actually see
[02:11:18 - 02:11:18] and that's what we're going
[02:11:18 - 02:11:23] to see when we get
[02:11:23 - 02:11:25] the data um so page
[02:11:25 - 02:11:28] 15 i'm kind of weird
[02:11:28 - 02:11:28] in that i look at
[02:11:31 - 02:11:31] deferred maintenance from four different
[02:11:32 - 02:11:32] perspectives but i'm not going
[02:11:32 - 02:11:35] to ask you for four
[02:11:35 - 02:11:35] i'm going to ask you
[02:11:35 - 02:11:39] for an additional perspective which
[02:11:39 - 02:11:42] is um cost per square
[02:11:42 - 02:11:43] foot uh for maintenance i
[02:11:43 - 02:11:46] know that's a weird way
[02:11:46 - 02:11:46] to do it i really
[02:11:46 - 02:11:49] appreciate where's that document i
[02:11:49 - 02:11:52] really appreciate page 22 the
[02:11:52 - 02:11:54] deferred maintenance projects budget but
[02:11:54 - 02:11:57] i'd like to see cost
[02:11:57 - 02:11:57] per square foot for the
[02:12:00 - 02:12:00] buildings that also tells you
[02:12:00 - 02:12:05] which way you're trending in
[02:12:05 - 02:12:08] terms of repairs and it
[02:12:08 - 02:12:08] if if your construction was
[02:12:10 - 02:12:13] well established then cost per
[02:12:13 - 02:12:17] square footage for certain buildings
[02:12:17 - 02:12:17] should not be very high
[02:12:19 - 02:12:19] but if they are and
[02:12:19 - 02:12:19] we may have to see
[02:12:21 - 02:12:21] the the buildings the year
[02:12:21 - 02:12:22] they were built i mean
[02:12:22 - 02:12:22] when you look at a
[02:12:24 - 02:12:24] building that's built in 1999
[02:12:24 - 02:12:26] versus a building that's built
[02:12:26 - 02:12:28] in 2019 there are clearly
[02:12:28 - 02:12:28] some things that you should
[02:12:28 - 02:12:31] not see in 2019 there
[02:12:31 - 02:12:34] are some things you should
[02:12:34 - 02:12:34] expect to see in 1999
[02:12:36 - 02:12:36] i also like the fact
[02:12:36 - 02:12:38] that you there's you're utilizing
[02:12:38 - 02:12:40] the rs means construction cost
[02:12:40 - 02:12:40] but it's a little construction
[02:12:40 - 02:12:41] cost but it's a little
[02:12:41 - 02:12:44] behind behind uh rs means
[02:12:46 - 02:12:46] is a little behind so
[02:12:46 - 02:12:49] we may have to have
[02:12:49 - 02:12:49] a second uh cost construction
[02:12:52 - 02:12:52] estimation system and they do
[02:12:52 - 02:12:54] have one that's a that's
[02:12:54 - 02:12:57] more succinct we may have
[02:12:57 - 02:12:57] to look at it from
[02:12:57 - 02:13:00] that perspective so that whatever
[02:13:00 - 02:13:03] the deficiencies are in rs
[02:13:03 - 02:13:03] means we don't miss them
[02:13:03 - 02:13:06] with another uh construction cost
[02:13:06 - 02:13:11] estimation system and that way
[02:13:11 - 02:13:15] some of these prices some
[02:13:15 - 02:13:15] of these prices are okay
[02:13:19 - 02:13:19] some of these prices questionable
[02:13:19 - 02:13:21] and so if we're going
[02:13:21 - 02:13:25] to maintain our fiscal integrity
[02:13:25 - 02:13:25] we're going to have to
[02:13:28 - 02:13:28] take a closer look with
[02:13:28 - 02:13:31] a with a a system
[02:13:31 - 02:13:31] that's more succinct uh but
[02:13:34 - 02:13:34] this is this is excellent
[02:13:34 - 02:13:36] and i think trusty chiban
[02:13:36 - 02:13:39] and trusty reichart would agree
[02:13:39 - 02:13:39] with me that this is
[02:13:39 - 02:13:42] very well done and we
[02:13:42 - 02:13:42] appreciate it as we go
[02:13:44 - 02:13:44] forward to try to determine
[02:13:44 - 02:13:47] what our next steps are
[02:13:47 - 02:13:47] going to be as a
[02:13:47 - 02:13:50] board to what we will
[02:13:50 - 02:13:50] do with all of the
[02:13:52 - 02:13:52] facilities that we have so

[02:15:53 - 02:15:58] we are in the second
[02:15:58 - 02:15:59] call special session and we
[02:15:59 - 02:15:59] wanted to just talk a
[02:15:59 - 02:16:01] little bit about our legislative
[02:16:01 - 02:16:05] sessions and related considerations have
[02:16:05 - 02:16:05] before you the 89th legislative
[02:16:08 - 02:16:08] session final report it's also
[02:16:08 - 02:16:11] a part of the the
[02:16:11 - 02:16:11] attachments but you have a
[02:16:13 - 02:16:13] hard copy form in your
[02:16:13 - 02:16:16] possession and it includes our
[02:16:16 - 02:16:18] work that was covered during
[02:16:18 - 02:16:20] the 89th regular legislative session
[02:16:20 - 02:16:20] to include those items that
[02:16:20 - 02:16:22] the board adopted that were
[02:16:22 - 02:16:24] acted upon during the legislative
[02:16:24 - 02:16:26] session appropriations matters and bills
[02:16:26 - 02:16:29] that we tracked monitored and
[02:16:29 - 02:16:31] that are applicable to us
[02:16:31 - 02:16:33] that gives you a snapshot
[02:16:33 - 02:16:33] view of what those bills
[02:16:36 - 02:16:36] require by way of compliance
[02:16:36 - 02:16:39] for the institution so that
[02:16:39 - 02:16:40] that document we'll also send
[02:16:40 - 02:16:40] to you if we haven't
[02:16:40 - 02:16:42] done it already sharon through
[02:16:42 - 02:16:45] the office of the chancellor
[02:16:45 - 02:16:47] a document that's electronic you
[02:16:47 - 02:16:47] can hoover over it with
[02:16:50 - 02:16:50] your mouse and it'll take
[02:16:50 - 02:16:52] you to the relevant section
[02:16:52 - 02:16:53] of this document so it'll
[02:16:53 - 02:16:53] be a little bit easier
[02:16:53 - 02:16:54] to find it'll be a
[02:16:55 - 02:16:57] little bit easier to find
[02:16:58 - 02:17:01] things so the we've had
[02:17:01 - 02:17:04] two special sessions um we
[02:17:04 - 02:17:04] uh in the first call
[02:17:04 - 02:17:07] session the governor did identified
[02:17:07 - 02:17:11] 18 policy considerations notable issues
[02:17:11 - 02:17:14] included disaster preparedness redistricting uh
[02:17:16 - 02:17:16] in no certain order public
[02:17:16 - 02:17:18] funds for lobbying activities and
[02:17:18 - 02:17:21] taxation matters no bills passed
[02:17:21 - 02:17:24] during the first call special
[02:17:24 - 02:17:27] session that session adjourned on
[02:17:27 - 02:17:27] august 15th at which time
[02:17:29 - 02:17:29] the governor called a second
[02:17:29 - 02:17:31] special session and that's where
[02:17:31 - 02:17:32] we are today when the
[02:17:32 - 02:17:35] governor called that special session
[02:17:35 - 02:17:35] he identified two 22 policy
[02:17:38 - 02:17:38] considerations um it convened on
[02:17:38 - 02:17:40] the 15th notable issues included
[02:17:40 - 02:17:42] the same from the the
[02:17:42 - 02:17:44] special session call session one
[02:17:44 - 02:17:47] which were disaster preparedness redistricting
[02:17:47 - 02:17:49] public uh funds for lobbying
[02:17:49 - 02:17:51] activities and taxation and as
[02:17:51 - 02:17:56] we speak the second call
[02:17:56 - 02:17:56] session continues uh to operate
[02:17:58 - 02:17:58] key bills that we were
[02:17:58 - 02:18:01] tracking during the special session
[02:18:01 - 02:18:03] particularly the second special session
[02:18:03 - 02:18:06] and mind you the the
[02:18:06 - 02:18:06] first special session related to
[02:18:06 - 02:18:07] the composition of districts that
[02:18:07 - 02:18:09] is the redistricting matter and
[02:18:09 - 02:18:12] the principal bill file in
[02:18:12 - 02:18:12] that regard was hb4 you
[02:18:14 - 02:18:14] note here that it passed
[02:18:14 - 02:18:18] the house on a vote
[02:18:18 - 02:18:18] of 88 to 52 it
[02:18:18 - 02:18:22] passed the senate on a
[02:18:22 - 02:18:22] vote of 18 to1 and
[02:18:22 - 02:18:25] was signed by the governor
[02:18:25 - 02:18:25] on uh on august the
[02:18:25 - 02:18:28] 27th there was no effective
[02:18:28 - 02:18:31] date assigned to um hb4
[02:18:31 - 02:18:31] i think the rules would
[02:18:31 - 02:18:33] provide that if the governor
[02:18:33 - 02:18:35] doesn't assign an effective date
[02:18:35 - 02:18:35] it will become at at
[02:18:36 - 02:18:39] the german of the spec
[02:18:39 - 02:18:42] special session 91 days it'll
[02:18:42 - 02:18:44] become effective um and then
[02:18:44 - 02:18:44] of course the companion bill
[02:18:44 - 02:18:47] which is also a redistricting
[02:18:47 - 02:18:49] bill was placed on the
[02:18:49 - 02:18:49] senate calendar on september the
[02:18:52 - 02:18:52] 2nd so that was yesterday
[02:18:52 - 02:18:55] we only need one of
[02:18:55 - 02:18:55] these bills to to pass
[02:18:55 - 02:18:58] and so i think you
[02:18:58 - 02:19:00] have that in hp4 and
[02:19:00 - 02:19:00] we've been sending via the
[02:19:00 - 02:19:03] weekly activity bulletin u notices
[02:19:03 - 02:19:04] about the redistricting matter and
[02:19:04 - 02:19:06] other related matters and uh
[02:19:06 - 02:19:07] if you have any questions
[02:19:07 - 02:19:08] with respect to those we're
[02:19:11 - 02:19:11] available to to answer those
[02:19:11 - 02:19:13] questions the only taxation matter
[02:19:13 - 02:19:15] that that popped forward is
[02:19:15 - 02:19:15] is not moving at well
[02:19:17 - 02:19:17] september 2nd it was placed
[02:19:17 - 02:19:18] on the senate calendar relating
[02:19:18 - 02:19:20] to the requirement uh regarding
[02:19:20 - 02:19:21] notice of certain property tax
[02:19:22 - 02:19:24] related information whether it applies
[02:19:24 - 02:19:26] to us is a little
[02:19:26 - 02:19:26] fuzzy but what this bill
[02:19:30 - 02:19:30] essentially does is require uh
[02:19:30 - 02:19:33] providing transparency in taxation matters
[02:19:33 - 02:19:35] if you're putting forth a
[02:19:35 - 02:19:36] tax rate want to make
[02:19:36 - 02:19:36] sure that the public is
[02:19:36 - 02:19:37] fully aware i think the
[02:19:37 - 02:19:40] board is already doing that
[02:19:40 - 02:19:40] but this would be enacted
[02:19:40 - 02:19:43] in uh in this bill
[02:19:43 - 02:19:45] should it pass sb13 relating
[02:19:45 - 02:19:45] to the use of uh
[02:19:45 - 02:19:47] by public subdivisions of public
[02:19:47 - 02:19:51] funds for lobbying activities uh
[02:19:51 - 02:19:54] that bill passed on a
[02:19:54 - 02:19:54] on 18 to 11 vote
[02:19:54 - 02:19:56] and it was referred to
[02:19:56 - 02:19:56] house state state affairs on
[02:19:58 - 02:19:58] august the 20th it's had
[02:19:58 - 02:20:01] no movement since then um
[02:20:01 - 02:20:01] not sure that's going to
[02:20:05 - 02:20:05] make it out uh to
[02:20:05 - 02:20:07] passage so the only thing
[02:20:07 - 02:20:07] that we will be looking
[02:20:07 - 02:20:10] at is the redistricting matter
[02:20:10 - 02:20:19] thus far that's on trustees
[02:20:19 - 02:20:19] i'll pause there because this
[02:20:21 - 02:20:21] the next section is probably
[02:20:21 - 02:20:25] a little more robust and
[02:20:25 - 02:20:25] so with respect to the
[02:20:26 - 02:20:26] special sessions if you have
[02:20:26 - 02:20:29] any questions i'm available to
[02:20:29 - 02:20:41] answer any okay so i'll
[02:20:41 - 02:20:41] shift gears and this is
[02:20:41 - 02:20:43] a work done on which
[02:20:43 - 02:20:47] you've been uh conducting as
[02:20:47 - 02:20:47] a board that the the
[02:20:47 - 02:20:48] sb37 relating to the governance
[02:20:48 - 02:20:50] of public institutions of higher
[02:20:50 - 02:20:51] education including review of curriculum
[02:20:51 - 02:20:53] and certain degrees and certificate
[02:20:56 - 02:20:56] programs you've already covered the
[02:20:58 - 02:20:58] faculty council or senate component
[02:20:58 - 02:20:59] of faculty council or senate
[02:20:59 - 02:21:01] component of sb37 sb37 but
[02:21:01 - 02:21:01] it also includes training of
[02:21:01 - 02:21:03] for members of the governing
[02:21:03 - 02:21:05] board that is this governing
[02:21:05 - 02:21:07] board and other governing boards
[02:21:07 - 02:21:07] like yours and the establishment
[02:21:08 - 02:21:08] powers and duties of the
[02:21:08 - 02:21:09] texas higher education coordinating board's
[02:21:13 - 02:21:13] umbbuzzman office over which you
[02:21:13 - 02:21:15] have no responsibility or any
[02:21:15 - 02:21:18] action necessary from this board
[02:21:18 - 02:21:20] but we've identified and i'm
[02:21:20 - 02:21:20] hopeful that you are able
[02:21:20 - 02:21:22] to see because we didn't
[02:21:22 - 02:21:24] memorialize it in the presentation
[02:21:24 - 02:21:24] but the the the flyer
[02:21:24 - 02:21:26] that we passed out that
[02:21:26 - 02:21:26] has to do with review
[02:21:28 - 02:21:28] of curriculum and certain degree
[02:21:28 - 02:21:31] and certificate programs that's the
[02:21:31 - 02:21:34] the big ticket item that's
[02:21:34 - 02:21:35] on your agenda for completion
[02:21:35 - 02:21:36] that is the board of
[02:21:39 - 02:21:39] trustees and effectively the the
[02:21:39 - 02:21:44] time to that tolls our
[02:21:44 - 02:21:44] work is january 1 to
[02:21:44 - 02:21:45] that tolls our work is
[02:21:45 - 02:21:47] january 1 2026 2026 we've
[02:21:47 - 02:21:48] commenced some of this work
[02:21:49 - 02:21:49] already but the tolling the
[02:21:49 - 02:21:54] time is january 1 2026
[02:21:54 - 02:21:54] and january 1 2027 is
[02:21:57 - 02:21:57] when this work should be
[02:21:57 - 02:21:59] complete so effectively we have
[02:21:59 - 02:21:59] about a year and a
[02:22:03 - 02:22:03] little bit to uh make
[02:22:03 - 02:22:03] this go forward little bit
[02:22:04 - 02:22:05] to uh make this go
[02:22:06 - 02:22:11] forward uh so we assembled
[02:22:11 - 02:22:11] the task force that helped
[02:22:15 - 02:22:15] with the faculty senate initiative
[02:22:15 - 02:22:17] and we've been working to
[02:22:17 - 02:22:19] try to pull together next
[02:22:19 - 02:22:19] steps that would allow us
[02:22:22 - 02:22:22] to ensure compliance with sp37
[02:22:22 - 02:22:24] the remaining provisions you note
[02:22:24 - 02:22:26] here that we sought the
[02:22:26 - 02:22:30] board's adoption of the new
[02:22:30 - 02:22:30] faculty senate on august the
[02:22:30 - 02:22:33] 20th uh and so that's
[02:22:33 - 02:22:35] done august 26th we convened
[02:22:35 - 02:22:35] a task force to establish
[02:22:36 - 02:22:38] an agenda and strategy for
[02:22:38 - 02:22:40] compliance with the remaining provisions
[02:22:40 - 02:22:43] of sp37 to include review
[02:22:43 - 02:22:46] of curriculum in certain degrees
[02:22:46 - 02:22:48] um on september 3rd that's
[02:22:48 - 02:22:50] where we are today we're
[02:22:50 - 02:22:53] presenting statutory provisions applicable dates
[02:22:53 - 02:22:54] and time and a timeline
[02:22:54 - 02:22:57] concerning compliance with sb37 let
[02:22:57 - 02:22:58] me note for your consideration
[02:22:58 - 02:23:01] the timeline for implementation simply
[02:23:01 - 02:23:03] serves as a guide it's
[02:23:03 - 02:23:03] likely to change as we
[02:23:03 - 02:23:05] learn things because this is
[02:23:05 - 02:23:05] a new bill a new
[02:23:05 - 02:23:08] new path that we're treading
[02:23:08 - 02:23:09] uh and we've been talking
[02:23:09 - 02:23:09] with folks who have the
[02:23:13 - 02:23:13] same responsibility to include um
[02:23:13 - 02:23:15] our peers and the the
[02:23:15 - 02:23:17] coordinating board so one of
[02:23:17 - 02:23:17] the things that we need
[02:23:17 - 02:23:19] to determine from the governing
[02:23:19 - 02:23:22] board is to determine from
[02:23:22 - 02:23:22] you whether you would uh
[02:23:25 - 02:23:25] like to appoint a committee
[02:23:25 - 02:23:27] to assist in the curriculum
[02:23:27 - 02:23:29] review it is not mandatory
[02:23:29 - 02:23:32] according to the provisions let
[02:23:32 - 02:23:32] me also say that i
[02:23:32 - 02:23:34] am in no way providing
[02:23:34 - 02:23:35] legal advice i'm the government
[02:23:35 - 02:23:38] relations person and i'm providing
[02:23:38 - 02:23:38] just policy uh my policy
[02:23:40 - 02:23:40] perspective and we we can
[02:23:40 - 02:23:42] rely on the lawyers for
[02:23:42 - 02:23:42] the legal component of it
[02:23:44 - 02:23:44] but it appears that the
[02:23:44 - 02:23:48] language provides that you have
[02:23:48 - 02:23:50] a opportunity to appoint a
[02:23:50 - 02:23:52] committee to walk through this
[02:23:52 - 02:23:55] process what we have assembled
[02:23:55 - 02:23:55] is a task force that's
[02:23:55 - 02:23:58] been conducting the work up
[02:23:58 - 02:24:01] until now so as we
[02:24:01 - 02:24:01] determine from the governing board
[02:24:01 - 02:24:03] uh whether it's desires to
[02:24:03 - 02:24:05] appoint a committee we'll proceed
[02:24:05 - 02:24:06] to continue it complying with
[02:24:06 - 02:24:08] the with the relevant bills
[02:24:08 - 02:24:08] so that would be something
[02:24:08 - 02:24:10] that we should identify on
[02:24:10 - 02:24:13] september the 4th the task
[02:24:13 - 02:24:13] force would uh convene to
[02:24:16 - 02:24:16] review the core curriculum uh
[02:24:16 - 02:24:19] initiative and pa map our
[02:24:19 - 02:24:22] uh path forward that would
[02:24:22 - 02:24:22] be tomorrow uh convening a
[02:24:22 - 02:24:23] task force to address certain
[02:24:23 - 02:24:26] minor degrees so the the
[02:24:26 - 02:24:26] core curriculum is on the
[02:24:26 - 02:24:27] 4th which is the big
[02:24:27 - 02:24:29] component then the minor degrees
[02:24:29 - 02:24:29] would be on the 11th

[02:27:05 - 02:27:07] would be done for the
[02:27:07 - 02:27:07] for the year and we
[02:27:07 - 02:27:09] would be ahead of the
[02:27:09 - 02:27:09] tolling of of the time
[02:27:12 - 02:27:12] on january 1 2026 with

[02:27:15 - 02:27:19] that would take us through
[02:27:19 - 02:27:21] january 1 2027 those are
[02:27:21 - 02:27:24] the the immediate first identified
[02:27:24 - 02:27:24] steps that we would take
[02:27:24 - 02:27:25] to march our way through

[02:27:38 - 02:27:40] appreciate the detailed kind of

[02:27:41 - 02:27:42] end of the year with
[02:27:42 - 02:27:44] sp37 it's an incredibly complex
[02:27:44 - 02:27:46] and impactful piece of legislation
[02:27:46 - 02:27:46] and i i think we
[02:27:46 - 02:27:47] need this level of organization
[02:27:47 - 02:27:49] to get it all done
[02:27:49 - 02:27:49] in time so thank you
[02:27:49 - 02:27:52] for that thank you um
[02:27:52 - 02:27:52] on on the um general
[02:27:52 - 02:27:53] curriculum um on on the
[02:27:53 - 02:27:53] um general curriculum review review
[02:27:54 - 02:27:57] review um um i know
[02:27:57 - 02:27:57] we we we need to
[02:27:57 - 02:27:58] make as a board a
[02:27:58 - 02:27:58] decision about whether we want
[02:27:58 - 02:28:00] to assign a committee to
[02:28:00 - 02:28:03] work this on our behalf
[02:28:03 - 02:28:03] i'm curious when would y'all
[02:28:05 - 02:28:05] envision us or what when
[02:28:05 - 02:28:07] would y'all envision the appropriate
[02:28:07 - 02:28:09] time for us to name
[02:28:09 - 02:28:09] a committee uh to be
[02:28:09 - 02:28:11] if we were to move
[02:28:11 - 02:28:11] in that direction is that
[02:28:11 - 02:28:13] a a january thing is
[02:28:13 - 02:28:15] it a november thing i'm
[02:28:15 - 02:28:15] just curious like when we
[02:28:15 - 02:28:17] need to start you know
[02:28:17 - 02:28:19] soliciting input from our uh
[02:28:19 - 02:28:19] community members and such to
[02:28:19 - 02:28:21] to get the right people
[02:28:21 - 02:28:23] plugged in yeah and i
[02:28:23 - 02:28:23] was yield to the chancellor
[02:28:25 - 02:28:27] on on that question well
[02:28:27 - 02:28:27] thank you very much dr
[02:28:27 - 02:28:30] young trusty chieman i think
[02:28:30 - 02:28:33] the appropriate step would be
[02:28:33 - 02:28:33] to convene the task force
[02:28:35 - 02:28:35] which will have an additional
[02:28:38 - 02:28:38] subcommittee that will be a
[02:28:38 - 02:28:40] part of the task force
[02:28:40 - 02:28:40] discussions and this is a
[02:28:43 - 02:28:43] part of the conversation that
[02:28:43 - 02:28:45] i think would be appropriate
[02:28:45 - 02:28:47] to look at the appropriate
[02:28:47 - 02:28:50] timing because quite a number
[02:28:50 - 02:28:50] of the academic team members
[02:28:50 - 02:28:53] will be a part of
[02:28:53 - 02:28:53] the task force as well
[02:28:53 - 02:28:55] with the administration and i
[02:28:55 - 02:28:57] think that we would be
[02:28:57 - 02:28:57] able to get the best
[02:28:57 - 02:28:58] would be able to get
[02:28:58 - 02:29:00] the best recommendation recommendation to
[02:29:00 - 02:29:00] the board as an outcome
[02:29:00 - 02:29:03] of that meeting that will
[02:29:03 - 02:29:04] be held thank thank you
[02:29:04 - 02:29:04] for that i know there
[02:29:05 - 02:29:05] was there was a conditional
[02:29:05 - 02:29:08] in there about maybe october
[02:29:08 - 02:29:10] maybe november but i think
[02:29:10 - 02:29:10] that discussion would be good
[02:29:10 - 02:29:11] to bring back to us
[02:29:11 - 02:29:12] in october so we have
[02:29:13 - 02:29:13] that additional time to get
[02:29:13 - 02:29:15] the right nominees from the
[02:29:15 - 02:29:18] community to participate um second
[02:29:18 - 02:29:20] question um i i i've
[02:29:20 - 02:29:20] read this legislation a few
[02:29:20 - 02:29:21] times and each time i've
[02:29:21 - 02:29:24] read it i've been confused
[02:29:24 - 02:29:24] about this requirement that we
[02:29:28 - 02:29:28] need to um certify compliance
[02:29:28 - 02:29:31] on january 1 of the
[02:29:31 - 02:29:31] year that we're going to
[02:29:33 - 02:29:33] undertake these reviews so is
[02:29:33 - 02:29:34] this like we we tell
[02:29:34 - 02:29:34] them we're going to do
[02:29:36 - 02:29:36] it and then we do
[02:29:36 - 02:29:36] it on january 1 or
[02:29:36 - 02:29:38] do we do it and
[02:29:38 - 02:29:38] then on january 1 2027
[02:29:38 - 02:29:40] we tell them we did
[02:29:40 - 02:29:40] it which which way is
[02:29:40 - 02:29:40] tell them we did it
[02:29:41 - 02:29:41] which which way is it
[02:29:41 - 02:29:43] it yeah and might i
[02:29:43 - 02:29:53] yield to council on yes
[02:29:53 - 02:29:53] we have looked at that
[02:29:53 - 02:29:55] uh trustee and i think
[02:29:55 - 02:29:55] it would be best for
[02:29:55 - 02:29:59] us to provide a legal
[02:29:59 - 02:30:01] counsel memo because some of
[02:30:01 - 02:30:01] that involves legal advice but
[02:30:04 - 02:30:04] we are not seeing where
[02:30:04 - 02:30:07] on january 1 2026 we
[02:30:07 - 02:30:07] have that type of certification
[02:30:07 - 02:30:08] 2026 we have that type
[02:30:08 - 02:30:11] of certification due due okay
[02:30:11 - 02:30:14] thank you any other questions
[02:30:18 - 02:30:18] i'm noticing a lot of
[02:30:18 - 02:30:25] education uh bills based upon
[02:30:25 - 02:30:29] the legislative um the new
[02:30:29 - 02:30:32] legislative funding plan it seems
[02:30:32 - 02:30:32] that some of these bills
[02:30:32 - 02:30:34] are not going to provide
[02:30:34 - 02:30:37] funding for what is required
[02:30:37 - 02:30:37] is that the case uh
[02:30:37 - 02:30:38] most of the bills from
[02:30:38 - 02:30:40] the 89th legislative session we
[02:30:40 - 02:30:40] had a cleanup bill with
[02:30:44 - 02:30:44] regard to and i forget
[02:30:44 - 02:30:48] it said 1786 i forget
[02:30:48 - 02:30:48] the bill number um but
[02:30:48 - 02:30:51] the short answer is you're
[02:30:51 - 02:30:53] correct um we most of
[02:30:53 - 02:30:53] our funding is coming out
[02:30:53 - 02:30:56] of the appropriations bill and
[02:30:56 - 02:30:58] you'll see that on your
[02:30:58 - 02:31:00] introductory page at page five
[02:31:00 - 02:31:00] and in the document that
[02:31:00 - 02:31:02] i gave gave to you
[02:31:02 - 02:31:03] you see the state appropriations
[02:31:03 - 02:31:05] in the texas community colleges
[02:31:05 - 02:31:05] appropriations which is the colleges
[02:31:05 - 02:31:06] appropriations which is the 2
[02:31:07 - 02:31:10] 4 2 4 billion and
[02:31:10 - 02:31:10] that then the 89 5
[02:31:13 - 02:31:13] million for the uh supplemental
[02:31:13 - 02:31:16] funding but the remainder of
[02:31:16 - 02:31:17] the bills were there was
[02:31:17 - 02:31:17] only one bill that was
[02:31:17 - 02:31:19] a cleanup bill that related
[02:31:19 - 02:31:22] to hb8 and it wasn't
[02:31:22 - 02:31:22] an appropriations bill so we
[02:31:22 - 02:31:26] had two principal appropriations bill
[02:31:26 - 02:31:28] the um primary the general
[02:31:28 - 02:31:30] appropriations act and then the
[02:31:30 - 02:31:33] supplemental bill two bills from
[02:31:33 - 02:31:35] from the on appropriations so
[02:31:35 - 02:31:39] for the board it it's
[02:31:39 - 02:31:39] going to be good for
[02:31:39 - 02:31:42] us to really know and
[02:31:42 - 02:31:48] understand how we will or
[02:31:48 - 02:31:48] will not be paid um
[02:31:48 - 02:31:52] i know that the list
[02:31:52 - 02:31:54] of um i guess the
[02:31:54 - 02:31:58] list of degrees or certifications
[02:31:58 - 02:32:00] has been narrowed that the
[02:32:00 - 02:32:00] it looks like the most
[02:32:00 - 02:32:03] popular degrees have been eliminated
[02:32:03 - 02:32:06] from the payment system yeah
[02:32:06 - 02:32:06] and you saw and some
[02:32:06 - 02:32:07] of those metrics and and
[02:32:07 - 02:32:10] just incidentally trustees the primary
[02:32:10 - 02:32:12] bill for appropriations that is
[02:32:12 - 02:32:14] at page eight on your
[02:32:14 - 02:32:14] in your document that do
[02:32:14 - 02:32:17] that that book and it's
[02:32:17 - 02:32:20] sp1 and the supplemental bill
[02:32:20 - 02:32:20] is up under it at
[02:32:20 - 02:32:22] hp500 uh but what you're
[02:32:22 - 02:32:24] referring to trustee i believe
[02:32:24 - 02:32:24] is the the metrics that
[02:32:24 - 02:32:27] are assigned and which which
[02:32:27 - 02:32:29] uh courses get dollars assigned
[02:32:29 - 02:32:29] to them and so some
[02:32:29 - 02:32:31] of that has been taken
[02:32:31 - 02:32:31] back we saw some of
[02:32:33 - 02:32:33] that at the uh tac
[02:32:33 - 02:32:33] conference during the that at
[02:32:33 - 02:32:33] the uh tac conference during
[02:32:33 - 02:32:35] the summer summer yes sir
[02:32:35 - 02:32:35] so some of those those
[02:32:35 - 02:32:38] courses that were once given
[02:32:38 - 02:32:40] dollars are not are no
[02:32:40 - 02:32:40] longer going to receive dollars
[02:32:40 - 02:32:42] and so we've been conscious
[02:32:42 - 02:32:44] of that and i see
[02:32:44 - 02:32:44] that there are a few
[02:32:44 - 02:32:47] bills from senate bill and
[02:32:47 - 02:32:50] even house bill where they
[02:32:50 - 02:32:53] are addressing students with disabilities
[02:32:53 - 02:32:57] also without providing funding for
[02:32:57 - 02:32:57] that pathway we have vast
[02:32:59 - 02:32:59] academy which is extraordinary but
[02:33:00 - 02:33:01] it's very narrow in scope
[02:33:01 - 02:33:03] in that if correct me
[02:33:03 - 02:33:03] if i'm wrong we have
[02:33:03 - 02:33:06] fewer than 100 students a
[02:33:06 - 02:33:06] year in vast academy who
[02:33:06 - 02:33:09] who where is best academy
[02:33:09 - 02:33:09] are they not here where
[02:33:09 - 02:33:09] is best academy are they
[02:33:09 - 02:33:11] not here today today not
[02:33:11 - 02:33:11] sure they're here represented today
[02:33:14 - 02:33:14] okay we we did get
[02:33:14 - 02:33:17] a request from the tac
[02:33:17 - 02:33:17] to identify all of those
[02:33:18 - 02:33:20] unfunded state mandates and the
[02:33:20 - 02:33:22] the the associated dollars that
[02:33:22 - 02:33:24] we expend to to maintain
[02:33:24 - 02:33:24] those or make those happen
[02:33:24 - 02:33:27] and so we submitted what
[02:33:27 - 02:33:28] we thought was uh helpful
[02:33:28 - 02:33:28] for them to share with
[02:33:28 - 02:33:30] in fact the governor asked
[02:33:30 - 02:33:31] for it so in response
[02:33:31 - 02:33:31] to the governor's request for
[02:33:35 - 02:33:35] that we sent that uh
[02:33:35 - 02:33:38] maybe a month ago okay
[02:33:38 - 02:33:38] so i i think my
[02:33:38 - 02:33:40] statement is this is a
[02:33:40 - 02:33:40] tight squeeze that we didn't
[02:33:40 - 02:33:42] expect with with the way
[02:33:42 - 02:33:46] that the bills are written
[02:33:46 - 02:33:46] it is not providing funding
[02:33:46 - 02:33:49] for some of the mandates
[02:33:49 - 02:33:52] for what we are paid
[02:33:52 - 02:33:52] for for certain uh for
[02:33:55 - 02:33:57] certifications credentials of value that
[02:33:57 - 02:33:57] has been narrowed in scope
[02:33:57 - 02:34:00] as well yet they've broadened
[02:34:00 - 02:34:04] the base for who should
[02:34:04 - 02:34:04] be um educated and and
[02:34:04 - 02:34:07] not pay for education which
[02:34:07 - 02:34:09] is good that they don't
[02:34:09 - 02:34:09] have to pay but the
[02:34:09 - 02:34:13] for us it's how do
[02:34:13 - 02:34:13] we manage it such that
[02:34:13 - 02:34:15] it does not become an
[02:34:15 - 02:34:19] overwhelming fiscal burden for us
[02:34:19 - 02:34:19] vast academy it definitely needs
[02:34:22 - 02:34:22] to be expanded at an
[02:34:22 - 02:34:24] extraordinary rate because these bills
[02:34:24 - 02:34:27] are making it very clear
[02:34:27 - 02:34:27] that this is what is
[02:34:27 - 02:34:31] expected of higher education but
[02:34:31 - 02:34:31] i do not see in
[02:34:35 - 02:34:35] this bill book where they
[02:34:35 - 02:34:38] are actually paying for this
[02:34:40 - 02:34:40] what do we do so
[02:34:40 - 02:34:43] chancellor that is a concern
[02:34:43 - 02:34:43] because we have not ever
[02:34:47 - 02:34:47] expanded vast academy and even
[02:34:47 - 02:34:50] the age for vast academy
[02:34:50 - 02:34:50] is low but that now
[02:34:50 - 02:34:55] it is in this book
[02:34:55 - 02:34:55] as a very real issue
[02:34:55 - 02:34:57] and a very real requirement
[02:34:57 - 02:34:59] by house and senate bills
[02:34:59 - 02:34:59] but i don't see where
[02:35:01 - 02:35:01] there where there's any pay
[02:35:01 - 02:35:03] associated with it so how
[02:35:03 - 02:35:03] are we going to do
[02:35:03 - 02:35:04] with it so how are
[02:35:04 - 02:35:04] we going to do that
[02:35:04 - 02:35:07] that well i think you
[02:35:07 - 02:35:09] know it requires us to
[02:35:09 - 02:35:09] be really very methodical and
[02:35:11 - 02:35:11] intentional about how we schedule
[02:35:11 - 02:35:13] all of our courses whether
[02:35:13 - 02:35:16] they're the short-term credentials of
[02:35:16 - 02:35:18] value the general academic courses
[02:35:18 - 02:35:21] that transfer the institutional licenses
[02:35:21 - 02:35:24] and certifications the academic transfer
[02:35:26 - 02:35:26] all of those are going
[02:35:26 - 02:35:26] to be key and we
[02:35:29 - 02:35:29] know that there is an
[02:35:29 - 02:35:31] increase of students within our
[02:35:31 - 02:35:33] community who are neurode divergent
[02:35:33 - 02:35:33] and so we are going
[02:35:36 - 02:35:36] to have to address those
[02:35:36 - 02:35:39] student populations as well and
[02:35:39 - 02:35:42] i saw dr lewis walk
[02:35:42 - 02:35:42] in as well and he
[02:35:42 - 02:35:45] oversees uh sue morasca who
[02:35:45 - 02:35:46] is with the vast academy
[02:35:46 - 02:35:46] and i'd like for him
[02:35:46 - 02:35:49] to come forward and talk
[02:35:49 - 02:35:52] about the expansion of the
[02:35:52 - 02:35:52] vas academy because last year
[02:35:52 - 02:35:56] there was an expansion and
[02:35:56 - 02:35:58] this year there is another
[02:35:58 - 02:35:58] expansion as well to acres
[02:35:59 - 02:36:01] homes dr lewis yes chancellor
[02:36:01 - 02:36:04] we are expanding the vast
[02:36:04 - 02:36:04] academy throughout the district and
[02:36:05 - 02:36:05] currently we're setting up uh
[02:36:08 - 02:36:08] opportunities at the northeast location
[02:36:10 - 02:36:10] for vast students in addition
[02:36:10 - 02:36:13] to that trustee the age
[02:36:13 - 02:36:16] range for vast has expanded
[02:36:16 - 02:36:16] we received a moody grant
[02:36:16 - 02:36:18] so we have bridge to
[02:36:18 - 02:36:20] career pathways which is allowing
[02:36:20 - 02:36:20] those students on the two
[02:36:22 - 02:36:22] different tiers of vas if
[02:36:22 - 02:36:24] they're the upper tier to
[02:36:24 - 02:36:24] be able to complete in
[02:36:24 - 02:36:27] the vas program and then
[02:36:27 - 02:36:29] move into a workforce program
[02:36:29 - 02:36:32] in addition to that under
[02:36:32 - 02:36:32] the direction of miss morasa
[02:36:32 - 02:36:34] we were able to get
[02:36:34 - 02:36:36] financial aid for those students
[02:36:36 - 02:36:36] so now we have uh
[02:36:36 - 02:36:38] a larger footprint to work
[02:36:38 - 02:36:40] with more students the plan
[02:36:40 - 02:36:40] is to expand this out
[02:36:40 - 02:36:42] further and further throughout the
[02:36:42 - 02:36:44] district but we had to
[02:36:44 - 02:36:44] start somewhere so it's an
[02:36:47 - 02:36:47] incremental uh spread at currently
[02:36:47 - 02:36:52] so we have norththeast uh
[02:36:52 - 02:36:52] southwest we have central and
[02:36:54 - 02:36:54] we're going to continue to
[02:36:54 - 02:36:56] expand out to southeast and
[02:36:56 - 02:36:56] all the rest of the
[02:36:59 - 02:36:59] colleges as where the populations
[02:36:59 - 02:37:04] lie how many students at
[02:37:04 - 02:37:04] students at this point uh
[02:37:04 - 02:37:05] the exact number i need
[02:37:05 - 02:37:05] to get that exact number
[02:37:07 - 02:37:07] but the numbers for the
[02:37:07 - 02:37:10] vas program normally service around
[02:37:10 - 02:37:13] 155 or so students per
[02:37:13 - 02:37:13] year due to the level
[02:37:13 - 02:37:15] of serviceability and the the
[02:37:15 - 02:37:17] number of individuals that are
[02:37:17 - 02:37:17] needed due to the individuals
[02:37:17 - 02:37:18] that are needed due to
[02:37:18 - 02:37:21] the students students levels of
[02:37:21 - 02:37:21] ability so you have the
[02:37:21 - 02:37:23] life skills level and then
[02:37:23 - 02:37:25] you have a level that's
[02:37:25 - 02:37:27] working more towards workforce and
[02:37:27 - 02:37:27] we're able to facilitate the
[02:37:27 - 02:37:29] two the most exciting portion
[02:37:29 - 02:37:32] of this is that now
[02:37:32 - 02:37:32] there's no age limit initially
[02:37:35 - 02:37:35] it was looking at 18
[02:37:35 - 02:37:36] to 25 but again um
[02:37:38 - 02:37:38] working with dr perez and
[02:37:38 - 02:37:41] myself sumarasa we've expanded that
[02:37:41 - 02:37:43] to whatever end so it
[02:37:43 - 02:37:43] doesn't matter the age of
[02:37:43 - 02:37:46] the individual so any student
[02:37:46 - 02:37:47] at any age can come
[02:37:47 - 02:37:47] back and engage in the
[02:37:47 - 02:37:50] vast academy with the hope
[02:37:50 - 02:37:52] and the encouragement and the
[02:37:52 - 02:37:54] supports to get those students
[02:37:54 - 02:37:54] to receive some type of
[02:37:56 - 02:37:56] credential here at the college
[02:37:58 - 02:37:58] uh what are the corporations
[02:37:58 - 02:37:59] that are willing to work
[02:37:59 - 02:37:59] with us to hire our
[02:38:01 - 02:38:01] students because i know quite
[02:38:01 - 02:38:04] a few will they have
[02:38:04 - 02:38:08] dedicated uh employment spaces for
[02:38:08 - 02:38:09] uh neurodeiverse uh students that
[02:38:09 - 02:38:10] are graduating that are graduating
[02:38:10 - 02:38:12] yes yes what what do
[02:38:12 - 02:38:12] we have a list of
[02:38:15 - 02:38:15] corporations and how can we
[02:38:15 - 02:38:15] expand that corporations and how
[02:38:15 - 02:38:15] can we expand that list
[02:38:15 - 02:38:17] list well currently we're working
[02:38:17 - 02:38:19] with md anderson we started
[02:38:19 - 02:38:21] this fall with md anders
[02:38:21 - 02:38:21] for an internship that students
[02:38:23 - 02:38:23] will be working there at
[02:38:23 - 02:38:24] that location and we're also
[02:38:24 - 02:38:26] working with community organizations such
[02:38:26 - 02:38:26] as uh the center for
[02:38:28 - 02:38:28] pursuit that i believe is
[02:38:28 - 02:38:30] on the east side and
[02:38:30 - 02:38:30] we're working at various other
[02:38:33 - 02:38:33] organizations that focus on um
[02:38:33 - 02:38:34] expanding those opportunities in addition
[02:38:34 - 02:38:36] to the moody foundation they
[02:38:36 - 02:38:38] are also working with us
[02:38:38 - 02:38:38] to find different types of
[02:38:41 - 02:38:41] opportunities for individuals to engage
[02:38:43 - 02:38:43] we're more than happy to
[02:38:43 - 02:38:45] accept any leads for partnering
[02:38:45 - 02:38:47] with any corporations for neuro
[02:38:47 - 02:38:49] divergent students um at any
[02:38:49 - 02:38:51] point in time but the
[02:38:51 - 02:38:51] college is working towards a
[02:38:52 - 02:38:52] comprehensive means by which to
[02:38:52 - 02:38:54] address the needs of all
[02:38:54 - 02:38:56] community members within this city
[02:38:59 - 02:38:59] so dr christina robinson and
[02:38:59 - 02:39:04] and her extensive list um
[02:39:04 - 02:39:04] that does not include neurodeiverse
[02:39:06 - 02:39:09] uh employment we need to
[02:39:09 - 02:39:13] understand what that list looks
[02:39:13 - 02:39:13] like and i know that
[02:39:13 - 02:39:15] um stu uh students who
[02:39:15 - 02:39:19] are neurodeiverse those corporations do
[02:39:19 - 02:39:20] understand who they can hire
[02:39:20 - 02:39:20] and where they can put
[02:39:22 - 02:39:22] them they do have an
[02:39:22 - 02:39:27] understanding of that but we
[02:39:27 - 02:39:27] need that list um because
[02:39:29 - 02:39:29] if we've expanded from i
[02:39:29 - 02:39:31] think we should do 76
[02:39:31 - 02:39:31] students a year or something
[02:39:31 - 02:39:34] it was very low yeah
[02:39:34 - 02:39:35] it was a u it
[02:39:35 - 02:39:36] was very low yeah the
[02:39:36 - 02:39:38] capacity initially it started at
[02:39:38 - 02:39:38] central there was a small
[02:39:38 - 02:39:40] number of students that we
[02:39:40 - 02:39:42] initially worked with and again
[02:39:42 - 02:39:42] under sumaraska to build that
[02:39:45 - 02:39:45] up but the team has
[02:39:45 - 02:39:47] grown over the years and
[02:39:47 - 02:39:47] the investment of the institution
[02:39:48 - 02:39:48] into these other locations has
[02:39:48 - 02:39:50] allowed for that expansion and
[02:39:50 - 02:39:52] also the expansion of students
[02:39:52 - 02:39:53] who are more diverse and
[02:39:53 - 02:39:55] that's grown across the state
[02:39:55 - 02:39:55] as you mentioned earlier and
[02:39:55 - 02:39:57] the chancellor has mentioned with
[02:39:57 - 02:39:59] that same growth we are
[02:39:59 - 02:40:01] trying working to meet those
[02:40:01 - 02:40:01] ends in fact we even
[02:40:01 - 02:40:03] are working with online options
[02:40:03 - 02:40:04] for some of the students
[02:40:04 - 02:40:04] who have the abilities to
[02:40:08 - 02:40:08] engage in that way so
[02:40:08 - 02:40:10] last week uh we had
[02:40:10 - 02:40:10] an opportunity to visit with
[02:40:10 - 02:40:12] i had an opportunity to
[02:40:12 - 02:40:14] visit with sue and others
[02:40:14 - 02:40:14] and looking at opportunities for
[02:40:15 - 02:40:15] even maybe engaging in online
[02:40:18 - 02:40:18] opportunities for more students through
[02:40:19 - 02:40:23] the vas program so we
[02:40:23 - 02:40:23] we will train them for
[02:40:23 - 02:40:26] online learning because i know
[02:40:26 - 02:40:28] during during co it was
[02:40:28 - 02:40:30] a nightmare for neurodeiverse students
[02:40:30 - 02:40:30] that that was an adjustment
[02:40:33 - 02:40:33] they could not make so
[02:40:33 - 02:40:35] it would be it's good
[02:40:35 - 02:40:35] to know that uh sumarasa
[02:40:36 - 02:40:38] has already headed in that
[02:40:38 - 02:40:41] direction i have to give
[02:40:41 - 02:40:41] kudos to vast academy they've
[02:40:42 - 02:40:42] done an extraordinary work and
[02:40:42 - 02:40:45] they're nationally recognized for what
[02:40:45 - 02:40:46] they do and they are
[02:40:46 - 02:40:46] the best at what they
[02:40:46 - 02:40:49] do and they have literally
[02:40:49 - 02:40:52] worked they've literally made bricks
[02:40:52 - 02:40:53] without straw so i don't
[02:40:53 - 02:40:53] know what our budget looks
[02:40:54 - 02:40:57] like and i know our
[02:40:57 - 02:40:57] budget is very tight um
[02:41:01 - 02:41:01] i'm looking at dr han
[02:41:01 - 02:41:03] it's very tight but this
[02:41:03 - 02:41:03] is a population that has
[02:41:03 - 02:41:06] grown considerably in this region
[02:41:06 - 02:41:08] but they are eligible for
[02:41:08 - 02:41:11] work when those corporations work
[02:41:11 - 02:41:11] with us and to to
[02:41:14 - 02:41:14] define what they want from
[02:41:14 - 02:41:16] us it's the same thing
[02:41:16 - 02:41:16] that we've done in the
[02:41:16 - 02:41:19] past we when we did
[02:41:19 - 02:41:19] it for ai robotics and
[02:41:22 - 02:41:22] and cyber security we brought
[02:41:22 - 02:41:25] in industry to tell us
[02:41:25 - 02:41:26] what the training should look
[02:41:26 - 02:41:28] like what the curriculum should
[02:41:28 - 02:41:28] look like and all of
[02:41:28 - 02:41:31] it came a stellar program
[02:41:31 - 02:41:31] so i look forward to
[02:41:32 - 02:41:34] uh corporations working with vast
[02:41:34 - 02:41:37] academy to guarantee these students
[02:41:37 - 02:41:40] employment that is a lot
[02:41:40 - 02:41:43] of those students are employment
[02:41:43 - 02:41:43] eligible but you have to
[02:41:43 - 02:41:45] find the companies that are
[02:41:45 - 02:41:47] willing to work closely with
[02:41:47 - 02:41:47] us to guarantee that so
[02:41:50 - 02:41:50] thank you for expanding it
[02:41:50 - 02:41:54] it is a blessing thank
[02:41:54 - 02:41:54] uh the vast academy team
[02:41:56 - 02:41:56] for the work that they've
[02:41:56 - 02:41:59] done because it was not
[02:41:59 - 02:41:59] easy to expand and yet
[02:42:01 - 02:42:03] they've done it again and
[02:42:03 - 02:42:03] so i look forward to
[02:42:03 - 02:42:05] seeing them gain yet another
[02:42:05 - 02:42:06] national recognition for the work
[02:42:06 - 02:42:06] that they've done thank for
[02:42:06 - 02:42:07] the work that they've done

[02:46:17 - 02:46:17] as we are rebranding we
[02:46:17 - 02:46:19] have developed a set of
[02:46:19 - 02:46:22] core marketing messages that help
[02:46:22 - 02:46:24] us reposition the college with
[02:46:24 - 02:46:24] a focus on the student

[02:46:51 - 02:46:54] have put out there but

[02:47:10 - 02:47:10] multiple targeted mini campaigns and
[02:47:10 - 02:47:13] our comparative july report shows

[02:49:00 - 02:49:02] um and this is our
[02:49:02 - 02:49:02] timeline i just want to
[02:49:05 - 02:49:05] pull it up but briefly
[02:49:05 - 02:49:08] to mention it we have
[02:49:08 - 02:49:08] advertorial created we have been
[02:49:11 - 02:49:12] doing communication through our media
[02:49:14 - 02:49:14] social media but our big
[02:49:14 - 02:49:16] reveal coming up this friday
[02:49:16 - 02:49:19] at the convocation we have
[02:49:19 - 02:49:19] a lot of influencers and
[02:49:19 - 02:49:23] media in the crowd so
[02:49:23 - 02:49:23] that will give us a
[02:49:23 - 02:49:26] big um push one more
[02:49:26 - 02:49:29] time this friday by monday
[02:49:29 - 02:49:29] morning we have planned that
[02:49:29 - 02:49:30] is with in collaboration with
[02:49:30 - 02:49:34] the communication directors at the
[02:49:34 - 02:49:38] colleges to start updating all
[02:49:38 - 02:49:40] our websites um so that
[02:49:40 - 02:49:40] is currently the plan but
[02:49:40 - 02:49:42] if you can see right
[02:49:42 - 02:49:42] now we are putting out
[02:49:45 - 02:49:45] teasers something big is coming
[02:49:45 - 02:49:48] that is all over the
[02:49:48 - 02:49:48] social media and uh moving
[02:49:51 - 02:49:51] forward we will have our
[02:49:51 - 02:49:53] starting this monday actually friday
[02:49:53 - 02:49:55] it's effort we will have
[02:49:55 - 02:49:56] our brand reveal and we'll
[02:49:58 - 02:49:58] continue those effort we do
[02:49:58 - 02:50:01] have plans for student engagement
[02:50:01 - 02:50:04] on campuses and continue these
[02:50:04 - 02:50:04] short teasers so yeah we
[02:50:12 - 02:50:12] any other questions trusty trust
[02:50:14 - 02:50:14] hi um wanted to ask
[02:50:14 - 02:50:18] about the houston reconnect slide
[02:50:18 - 02:50:18] um so 51 students are
[02:50:20 - 02:50:20] now 63 students per your
[02:50:20 - 02:50:22] updated number great progress but
[02:50:22 - 02:50:24] it still falls quite a
[02:50:24 - 02:50:24] bit short of the aspirations
[02:50:24 - 02:50:25] that we had when we
[02:50:25 - 02:50:25] passed the budget i think
[02:50:27 - 02:50:27] we were thinking more in
[02:50:27 - 02:50:29] the lines of about 8
[02:50:29 - 02:50:29] 000 students so a couple
[02:50:32 - 02:50:32] orders of magnitude off um
[02:50:32 - 02:50:33] curious i mean recognizing this
[02:50:33 - 02:50:36] is very difficult work to
[02:50:36 - 02:50:36] identify students who are living
[02:50:38 - 02:50:38] their lives and inform them
[02:50:38 - 02:50:40] that there's this great opportunity
[02:50:40 - 02:50:42] and then convince them to
[02:50:42 - 02:50:42] change their lives to come
[02:50:42 - 02:50:44] back and and uh finish
[02:50:44 - 02:50:46] their education but curious through
[02:50:46 - 02:50:48] this experience over the last
[02:50:48 - 02:50:48] few months what have we
[02:50:48 - 02:50:50] learned what are we planning
[02:50:50 - 02:50:52] to change so that we
[02:50:52 - 02:50:52] can get more or closer
[02:50:52 - 02:50:53] to the target student population
[02:50:53 - 02:50:55] that we had envisioned for
[02:50:55 - 02:50:56] the spring semester trustee this
[02:50:56 - 02:50:56] is a very good question
[02:50:56 - 02:50:59] so we are working very
[02:50:59 - 02:51:00] closely with our student services
[02:51:00 - 02:51:04] partner almost checking in um
[02:51:04 - 02:51:07] daily weekly to see where
[02:51:07 - 02:51:07] we are and how we
[02:51:07 - 02:51:09] can further enhance our efforts
[02:51:09 - 02:51:11] for marketing it is something
[02:51:11 - 02:51:11] that we are also seeing
[02:51:11 - 02:51:14] in our connect to campaign
[02:51:14 - 02:51:16] that is currently going on
[02:51:16 - 02:51:16] i'll report next month on
[02:51:16 - 02:51:19] that one but we are
[02:51:19 - 02:51:20] making sure if we need
[02:51:23 - 02:51:23] to put money behind it
[02:51:23 - 02:51:23] we make it a a
[02:51:26 - 02:51:26] paid campaign if there is
[02:51:26 - 02:51:28] so we are just making
[02:51:28 - 02:51:28] sure we are using different
[02:51:31 - 02:51:31] media and different ways to
[02:51:31 - 02:51:33] connect with the different audiences
[02:51:33 - 02:51:34] that we have all right
[02:51:34 - 02:51:34] thanks i think it'd be
[02:51:37 - 02:51:37] helpful to understand um in
[02:51:37 - 02:51:40] the web perhaps um where
[02:51:40 - 02:51:41] y'all have identified vectors that
[02:51:41 - 02:51:43] aren't as work as successful
[02:51:43 - 02:51:45] where you're changing your approach
[02:51:45 - 02:51:45] to try to target students
[02:51:45 - 02:51:47] where they're at um just
[02:51:47 - 02:51:48] be good information to have
[02:51:48 - 02:51:48] and we don't need to
[02:51:48 - 02:51:49] take up meeting time necessarily
[02:51:49 - 02:51:50] for that so thank you
[02:51:50 - 02:51:56] in advance uh thank you
[02:51:56 - 02:51:58] for the pre presentation um
[02:51:58 - 02:51:58] the social i want to
[02:51:58 - 02:52:01] make a comment about the
[02:52:01 - 02:52:01] social media uh because i
[02:52:04 - 02:52:04] appreciate seeing uh houston community
[02:52:07 - 02:52:07] college at the social media
[02:52:07 - 02:52:11] level in a in a
[02:52:11 - 02:52:11] in the passive perspective um
[02:52:12 - 02:52:15] in linkedin and linkedin is
[02:52:15 - 02:52:19] clearly our largest uh reach
[02:52:19 - 02:52:21] i think it's what 130
[02:52:21 - 02:52:21] 000 people something like that
[02:52:26 - 02:52:26] great reach um also having
[02:52:26 - 02:52:29] them at at uh in
[02:52:29 - 02:52:29] the meta system for facebook
[02:52:29 - 02:52:34] and um um the i
[02:52:34 - 02:52:34] never i don't like the
[02:52:34 - 02:52:37] other one but anyway i
[02:52:37 - 02:52:37] do like to see i
[02:52:37 - 02:52:40] i do see a lot
[02:52:40 - 02:52:40] of southwest i do see
[02:52:40 - 02:52:44] central and i i expect
[02:52:44 - 02:52:44] to see more of southeast
[02:52:48 - 02:52:48] we need a balance we
[02:52:48 - 02:52:48] need a we need to
[02:52:48 - 02:52:48] we need a balance we
[02:52:49 - 02:52:49] need a we need to
[02:52:49 - 02:52:53] see see h houston city
[02:52:53 - 02:52:55] college at the broad brushstroke
[02:52:55 - 02:52:55] level in social media and
[02:52:57 - 02:52:57] then each of our colleges
[02:52:57 - 02:53:00] has to present itself because
[02:53:00 - 02:53:02] there are some specific things
[02:53:02 - 02:53:02] that each college has to
[02:53:02 - 02:53:06] do and has to offer
[02:53:06 - 02:53:06] and so um the social
[02:53:06 - 02:53:10] media handles um the profiles
[02:53:10 - 02:53:13] and the cover images i
[02:53:13 - 02:53:13] know it's a lot to
[02:53:13 - 02:53:15] clean up uh for a
[02:53:15 - 02:53:15] website that we decided to
[02:53:15 - 02:53:17] change and then decided to
[02:53:17 - 02:53:19] change the name after the
[02:53:19 - 02:53:19] fact so we put the
[02:53:20 - 02:53:22] cart before the horse but
[02:53:22 - 02:53:26] we still have to get
[02:53:26 - 02:53:28] it done um so in
[02:53:28 - 02:53:28] two places we're not visible
[02:53:28 - 02:53:31] but we'll have to work
[02:53:31 - 02:53:34] on that uh because we
[02:53:34 - 02:53:34] have to follow the my
[02:53:34 - 02:53:37] concern is the 18 to
[02:53:37 - 02:53:40] 35 year olds that's a
[02:53:40 - 02:53:43] substantial uh demographic and we're
[02:53:43 - 02:53:47] missing them um we're missing
[02:53:47 - 02:53:49] them but it's because their
[02:53:49 - 02:53:49] social media perspective is very
[02:53:51 - 02:53:51] different from what we perceive
[02:53:51 - 02:53:56] to be social media um
[02:53:56 - 02:53:59] i definitely would like to
[02:53:59 - 02:54:03] see a larger footprint in
[02:54:03 - 02:54:07] the other media areas uh
[02:54:07 - 02:54:07] because we cannot forget that
[02:54:10 - 02:54:10] those media areas have an
[02:54:10 - 02:54:12] impact so can you all
[02:54:12 - 02:54:12] explain to us what the
[02:54:12 - 02:54:14] other media areas areas look
[02:54:14 - 02:54:21] like besides thank you trustee
[02:54:21 - 02:54:21] for asking um i want
[02:54:23 - 02:54:23] to start with what you
[02:54:23 - 02:54:24] were talking about the other
[02:54:24 - 02:54:26] colleges and the good things
[02:54:26 - 02:54:26] they're doing you're right we
[02:54:28 - 02:54:28] do need to get on
[02:54:28 - 02:54:31] the same page with social
[02:54:31 - 02:54:31] media we are we have
[02:54:31 - 02:54:33] the people on team we're
[02:54:33 - 02:54:35] establishing a special social media
[02:54:35 - 02:54:35] team that's going to look
[02:54:36 - 02:54:36] at things totally differently we're
[02:54:39 - 02:54:39] going to strategically send out
[02:54:39 - 02:54:40] posts we're not just going
[02:54:40 - 02:54:40] to send out a post
[02:54:43 - 02:54:43] about an ice cream social
[02:54:43 - 02:54:45] at a campus at 3
[02:54:45 - 02:54:45] 00 the campuses can be
[02:54:45 - 02:54:47] doing that the college directors
[02:54:47 - 02:54:49] can be doing that we're
[02:54:49 - 02:54:49] looking at strategically coming up
[02:54:51 - 02:54:51] with a calendar to where
[02:54:51 - 02:54:54] all the college directors are
[02:54:54 - 02:54:57] college uh uh campus communications
[02:54:57 - 02:54:57] directors can be on the
[02:54:59 - 02:54:59] same page with us we're
[02:54:59 - 02:55:01] meeting with them monthly we're
[02:55:01 - 02:55:03] going to work with them
[02:55:03 - 02:55:03] to make sure we're all
[02:55:03 - 02:55:05] on the same page so
[02:55:05 - 02:55:06] we applaud the success the
[02:55:07 - 02:55:07] southwest college is having like
[02:55:07 - 02:55:09] you said last month we
[02:55:09 - 02:55:12] want to learn from them
[02:55:12 - 02:55:12] you did well with this
[02:55:12 - 02:55:14] how can we do well
[02:55:14 - 02:55:14] with it how we're going
[02:55:14 - 02:55:16] to do things differently is
[02:55:16 - 02:55:18] we're looking at different ways
[02:55:18 - 02:55:20] we're going to reach certain
[02:55:20 - 02:55:20] audiences for example if we
[02:55:22 - 02:55:22] have a reel that performs
[02:55:22 - 02:55:24] well we're going to look
[02:55:24 - 02:55:24] at that reel who do
[02:55:24 - 02:55:26] we send it out to
[02:55:26 - 02:55:26] what are the key words
[02:55:28 - 02:55:28] what are the key phrases
[02:55:28 - 02:55:30] how did we target that
[02:55:30 - 02:55:30] where did we get the
[02:55:31 - 02:55:31] success and we're going to
[02:55:31 - 02:55:33] try to replicate that we're
[02:55:33 - 02:55:35] testing that out right now
[02:55:35 - 02:55:35] we're kind of using a
[02:55:35 - 02:55:38] couple of our tv shows
[02:55:38 - 02:55:38] to test out our reels
[02:55:40 - 02:55:40] and see what draws the
[02:55:40 - 02:55:42] attention then we can go
[02:55:42 - 02:55:44] back to the communications directors
[02:55:44 - 02:55:44] compare our data to theirs
[02:55:46 - 02:55:46] and then we can all
[02:55:46 - 02:55:46] be on the same page
[02:55:47 - 02:55:47] and see how we can
[02:55:47 - 02:55:49] be successful together as opposed
[02:55:49 - 02:55:51] to one college getting 8
[02:55:51 - 02:55:51] 000 views for a view
[02:55:51 - 02:55:54] for a post another college
[02:55:54 - 02:56:01] getting 80 we good that
[02:56:01 - 02:56:01] that you can ask southwest
[02:56:03 - 02:56:03] what were they doing because
[02:56:03 - 02:56:06] they're everywhere i mean and
[02:56:06 - 02:56:06] i i have to play
[02:56:09 - 02:56:09] games on my phone cuz
[02:56:09 - 02:56:09] i have to stop my
[02:56:12 - 02:56:12] mind and they pop up
[02:56:12 - 02:56:13] all the time even in
[02:56:13 - 02:56:13] the games it's like what
[02:56:13 - 02:56:15] are these guys what are
[02:56:15 - 02:56:18] these guys doing i'm seeing
[02:56:18 - 02:56:20] hcc commercials the 15-second commercials
[02:56:20 - 02:56:23] 30 second commercials in the
[02:56:23 - 02:56:25] games section on social media
[02:56:25 - 02:56:26] which is good because as
[02:56:28 - 02:56:28] much as we may not
[02:56:28 - 02:56:31] want to admit it that
[02:56:31 - 02:56:31] passive punch sticks in the
[02:56:31 - 02:56:34] back of your mind so
[02:56:34 - 02:56:34] the i mean what are
[02:56:34 - 02:56:36] they they're doing a lot
[02:56:36 - 02:56:39] right i see central i
[02:56:39 - 02:56:39] see southeast one of the
[02:56:42 - 02:56:42] challenges i have is i
[02:56:42 - 02:56:46] can't repost a lot of
[02:56:46 - 02:56:46] it and i have reach
[02:56:46 - 02:56:49] but i can't repost it
[02:56:49 - 02:56:49] cuz it doesn't allow me
[02:56:49 - 02:56:52] to that's a problem two
[02:56:52 - 02:56:52] months ago i had that's
[02:56:52 - 02:56:53] a problem two months ago
[02:56:53 - 02:56:53] i had 899 000 899
[02:56:53 - 02:56:57] 000 views and none of
[02:56:57 - 02:57:01] them were hcc that's a
[02:57:01 - 02:57:01] problem so if i cannot
[02:57:01 - 02:57:04] repost if i cannot help
[02:57:04 - 02:57:06] that's a challenge because my
[02:57:06 - 02:57:06] goal is to make sure
[02:57:06 - 02:57:09] that as many people that
[02:57:09 - 02:57:09] i know that i reach
[02:57:09 - 02:57:13] can actually see hcc that
[02:57:13 - 02:57:14] is my goal so you
[02:57:14 - 02:57:14] all have to help me
[02:57:14 - 02:57:14] to make that you all
[02:57:14 - 02:57:15] have to help me to
[02:57:15 - 02:57:18] make that right right yeah
[02:57:18 - 02:57:18] trustee we are building a
[02:57:18 - 02:57:21] a library and we are
[02:57:21 - 02:57:25] putting marketing all marketing collateral
[02:57:25 - 02:57:28] um on a schedule so
[02:57:28 - 02:57:28] we will have everything ready
[02:57:28 - 02:57:32] prior to every semester aligning
[02:57:32 - 02:57:37] it with the um with
[02:57:37 - 02:57:37] our um the schedules so
[02:57:37 - 02:57:39] we are here on providing
[02:57:39 - 02:57:41] monthly reports allow us to
[02:57:41 - 02:57:41] bring more information back to
[02:57:44 - 02:57:44] you i'm sure you'll be
[02:57:44 - 02:57:46] pleased we are in alignment
[02:57:46 - 02:57:46] and we are listening going
[02:57:47 - 02:57:49] in that direction you guys
[02:57:49 - 02:57:49] are doing a great job
[02:57:49 - 02:57:52] and you it's it's good
[02:57:52 - 02:57:52] to see us catch up
[02:57:52 - 02:57:54] with social media i would
[02:57:54 - 02:57:56] encourage you to also post
[02:57:56 - 02:57:59] on the association of community
[02:57:59 - 02:58:01] college trustees social site they're
[02:58:01 - 02:58:01] expecting to see success and
[02:58:03 - 02:58:03] we're not we're not posting
[02:58:03 - 02:58:06] on with them and so
[02:58:06 - 02:58:06] if we hashtag and post
[02:58:06 - 02:58:08] with them i think that's
[02:58:08 - 02:58:10] another area where we have
[02:58:10 - 02:58:12] bragging rights as an institution
[02:58:12 - 02:58:12] in comparison to the other
[02:58:14 - 02:58:14] 1199 colleges i just happen
[02:58:14 - 02:58:16] to think we're the best
[02:58:16 - 02:58:16] so thank you for the
[02:58:18 - 02:58:18] work that you've done and
[02:58:18 - 02:58:21] thank you for catching up
[02:58:21 - 02:58:21] to social media and thank
[02:58:22 - 02:58:22] you for the website changes
[02:58:22 - 02:58:23] you for the website changes
[02:58:23 - 02:58:26] chancellor chancellor thank you very
[02:58:26 - 02:58:26] much mr chair and of
[02:58:28 - 02:58:28] course i i would like
[02:58:28 - 02:58:28] to add on to the
[02:58:30 - 02:58:30] comments that were made about
[02:58:30 - 02:58:33] the social media and indicate
[02:58:33 - 02:58:33] as well that we are
[02:58:35 - 02:58:35] attempting to unify all of
[02:58:35 - 02:58:38] the work that we do
[02:58:38 - 02:58:38] in terms of the messaging
[02:58:38 - 02:58:40] as opposed to having the
[02:58:40 - 02:58:43] messaging that might be fragmented
[02:58:43 - 02:58:43] in some way and so
[02:58:45 - 02:58:45] that's the reason for the
[02:58:45 - 02:58:48] library but in addition uh
[02:58:48 - 02:58:48] to that i have to
[02:58:48 - 02:58:50] of course as you indicated
[02:58:50 - 02:58:52] commend southwest and central but
[02:58:52 - 02:58:54] the other colleges as well
[02:58:54 - 02:58:57] have been sending out messages
[02:58:57 - 02:58:57] also not just those to
[02:59:00 - 02:59:00] northeast i've seen those coleman
[02:59:02 - 02:59:02] college and of course i
[02:59:02 - 02:59:05] have to uh address also
[02:59:05 - 02:59:07] south south northwest also all
[02:59:07 - 02:59:07] of the colleges but i
[02:59:07 - 02:59:11] have to commend hcctv and
[02:59:11 - 02:59:15] communications because frank has what
[02:59:15 - 02:59:15] is called social media on
[02:59:17 - 02:59:17] instagram and he has gotten
[02:59:17 - 02:59:19] a number of hits and
[02:59:19 - 02:59:19] so we're now looking at
[02:59:19 - 02:59:21] ways that we can then
[02:59:21 - 02:59:22] bring that into what we
[02:59:24 - 02:59:24] do as well to reach
[02:59:24 - 02:59:26] a unique audience and if
[02:59:26 - 02:59:26] you could just briefly touch
[02:59:26 - 02:59:29] on that please frank cooper
[02:59:29 - 02:59:29] is going to be working
[02:59:29 - 02:59:33] on a threeperson team um
[02:59:33 - 02:59:33] which is going to be
[02:59:35 - 02:59:35] strategic with social media as
[02:59:35 - 02:59:37] we mentioned earlier some of
[02:59:37 - 02:59:39] the things frank and that's
[02:59:39 - 02:59:39] one of the things i've
[02:59:41 - 02:59:41] sat down and talked to
[02:59:41 - 02:59:45] frank like frank you've getting
[02:59:45 - 02:59:45] 60 000 views on on
[02:59:45 - 02:59:48] one of your videos what
[02:59:48 - 02:59:50] exactly is this and it
[02:59:50 - 02:59:50] goes back to what we
[02:59:50 - 02:59:52] used in the news days
[02:59:52 - 02:59:52] what gets the views the
[02:59:52 - 02:59:55] action video he went out
[02:59:55 - 02:59:55] to the uh to the
[02:59:57 - 02:59:57] center of excellence the public
[02:59:57 - 02:59:59] safety institute and he shot
[02:59:59 - 03:00:00] firefighters going up and down
[03:00:00 - 03:00:02] the stairs people liked seeing
[03:00:02 - 03:00:04] that and they started re-sharing
[03:00:04 - 03:00:04] it and it became viral
[03:00:06 - 03:00:06] we're looking at ways of
[03:00:06 - 03:00:08] doing that but i've been
[03:00:08 - 03:00:08] going through we released a
[03:00:10 - 03:00:10] number of you'll get a
[03:00:10 - 03:00:12] report on this next month
[03:00:12 - 03:00:12] but we released a number
[03:00:12 - 03:00:15] of videos for the c2w
[03:00:15 - 03:00:18] campaign um so their reels
[03:00:18 - 03:00:18] we produced five of them
[03:00:20 - 03:00:20] we customized about 12 different
[03:00:20 - 03:00:22] ones for colleges upon their
[03:00:22 - 03:00:25] choice but we had one
[03:00:25 - 03:00:25] style within a few days
[03:00:25 - 03:00:26] with just a few dollars
[03:00:26 - 03:00:29] behind this we're talking less
[03:00:29 - 03:00:29] than 200 you know we're
[03:00:33 - 03:00:33] getting 1 7 000 views
[03:00:33 - 03:00:36] on a 10-second reel that
[03:00:36 - 03:00:36] leads them to the website
[03:00:39 - 03:00:39] where they can register so
[03:00:39 - 03:00:41] we're looking at things measuring
[03:00:41 - 03:00:43] on what works what doesn't
[03:00:43 - 03:00:45] and if does work why
[03:00:45 - 03:00:45] does it and how can
[03:00:45 - 03:00:49] we do it again and
[03:00:49 - 03:00:51] get better at it um
[03:00:51 - 03:00:51] thank you all dr adele

[03:13:03 - 03:13:08] with truth is freedom we
[03:13:08 - 03:13:08] need to decide are we

[03:13:22 - 03:13:26] newly appointed trustee may have
[03:13:26 - 03:13:33] misrepresented her residency and that
[03:13:33 - 03:13:37] is not dignity if she
[03:13:37 - 03:13:40] lie about her residency what
[03:13:40 - 03:13:40] else will she lie in
[03:13:40 - 03:13:45] the future will she conform

[03:13:52 - 03:13:52] a corrupt mind i would
[03:13:53 - 03:13:53] say transform to a corrupt

[03:15:46 - 03:15:48] time um i can spend

[03:15:50 - 03:15:52] talk all day about investments
[03:15:52 - 03:15:52] um but i'll try to
[03:15:52 - 03:15:54] keep it as brief as
[03:15:54 - 03:15:57] you like um i wanted
[03:15:57 - 03:15:57] to go through and give
[03:15:57 - 03:15:59] you an economic update what's
[03:15:59 - 03:16:01] going on um i can
[03:16:01 - 03:16:01] talk until i'm blue in
[03:16:01 - 03:16:03] the face of this and
[03:16:03 - 03:16:03] tomorrow morning when we wake
[03:16:04 - 03:16:04] up everything's changed because of
[03:16:04 - 03:16:08] the headlines so um take
[03:16:08 - 03:16:09] it with a grain of
[03:16:09 - 03:16:09] salt things will change but
[03:16:09 - 03:16:11] i'm trying to talk in
[03:16:11 - 03:16:12] generalities i want to give
[03:16:12 - 03:16:12] you an idea of what's
[03:16:12 - 03:16:14] happening what's been happening and
[03:16:14 - 03:16:16] how that impacts your portfolio
[03:16:16 - 03:16:18] last year i came here
[03:16:18 - 03:16:18] we had some recommendations on
[03:16:20 - 03:16:20] ways to improve your portfolio
[03:16:20 - 03:16:21] so i want to talk
[03:16:21 - 03:16:22] about the progress that was
[03:16:23 - 03:16:23] made on that you've made
[03:16:23 - 03:16:24] some good strides there uh
[03:16:24 - 03:16:24] and then we just have
[03:16:26 - 03:16:26] a few other recommendations that
[03:16:26 - 03:16:28] you can continue with if
[03:16:28 - 03:16:28] you choose to um just
[03:16:30 - 03:16:30] some things that we typically
[03:16:30 - 03:16:32] offer for our clients so
[03:16:32 - 03:16:32] want to make sure that
[03:16:34 - 03:16:34] you all have opportunities to
[03:16:34 - 03:16:36] discuss those ideas as well
[03:16:36 - 03:16:39] so i'll start with econom
[03:16:39 - 03:16:41] economic update so the federal
[03:16:41 - 03:16:43] open market committee referred to
[03:16:43 - 03:16:44] as fomc they're the committee
[03:16:44 - 03:16:44] that sets the federal funds
[03:16:47 - 03:16:47] rate and that has a
[03:16:47 - 03:16:49] large impact on the rates
[03:16:49 - 03:16:49] that you actually earn uh
[03:16:49 - 03:16:51] because as a government entity
[03:16:51 - 03:16:52] you typically have to keep
[03:16:52 - 03:16:54] your investments pretty short your
[03:16:54 - 03:16:57] investment policy requires three years
[03:16:57 - 03:16:57] and less so that rate
[03:16:59 - 03:16:59] that's set by the fomc
[03:16:59 - 03:17:01] has a really big impact
[03:17:01 - 03:17:01] on what you can invest
[03:17:01 - 03:17:04] in right now they have
[03:17:04 - 03:17:04] been taking the uh wait
[03:17:05 - 03:17:05] and see approach they haven't
[03:17:05 - 03:17:08] been making any changes to
[03:17:08 - 03:17:10] that rate because they want
[03:17:10 - 03:17:10] to see how various policies
[03:17:12 - 03:17:12] that have been implemented will
[03:17:12 - 03:17:15] impact the economy uh in
[03:17:15 - 03:17:17] general so their goal is
[03:17:17 - 03:17:17] to control inflation what they
[03:17:18 - 03:17:20] call price stability and to
[03:17:20 - 03:17:23] ensure that employment is at
[03:17:23 - 03:17:25] its maximum level so they
[03:17:25 - 03:17:25] are in uh the business
[03:17:25 - 03:17:27] of trying to help the
[03:17:27 - 03:17:27] economy along they can only
[03:17:30 - 03:17:30] adjust that fed funds rate
[03:17:30 - 03:17:32] to try and help or
[03:17:32 - 03:17:32] hinder the economy in any
[03:17:35 - 03:17:35] situation that they need to
[03:17:35 - 03:17:36] so uh right now tariffs
[03:17:36 - 03:17:39] have been the big headline
[03:17:39 - 03:17:39] um they have mentioned before
[03:17:41 - 03:17:41] this could have a short-lived
[03:17:41 - 03:17:43] impact or it could be
[03:17:43 - 03:17:45] more prolonged so they're trying
[03:17:45 - 03:17:45] to wait and see what
[03:17:45 - 03:17:47] the market data will tell
[03:17:47 - 03:17:47] them before they make any
[03:17:49 - 03:17:49] moves as i left the
[03:17:49 - 03:17:52] office today however the market
[03:17:52 - 03:17:54] probability of us seeing a
[03:17:54 - 03:17:54] rate cut of 25 basis
[03:17:54 - 03:17:56] points which is 0 25
[03:18:00 - 03:18:00] to that fed funds rate
[03:18:00 - 03:18:02] was at 97 for september
[03:18:02 - 03:18:04] so their meeting is september
[03:18:04 - 03:18:04] 16th and 17th and it
[03:18:04 - 03:18:05] is highly likely we will
[03:18:05 - 03:18:07] see a rate cut that'll
[03:18:07 - 03:18:07] be the first one since
[03:18:07 - 03:18:10] december of 2024 so it's
[03:18:10 - 03:18:10] been a long time since
[03:18:11 - 03:18:11] we've seen one and that
[03:18:11 - 03:18:13] could have some market impacts
[03:18:13 - 03:18:15] the market's already priced in
[03:18:15 - 03:18:15] that so the rates that
[03:18:17 - 03:18:17] you're getting now have already
[03:18:17 - 03:18:19] uh guessed that that will
[03:18:19 - 03:18:20] actually occur so rates have
[03:18:20 - 03:18:24] actually decreased since then some
[03:18:24 - 03:18:24] other items that also impact
[03:18:26 - 03:18:26] their decision the housing supply
[03:18:26 - 03:18:29] that has been a big
[03:18:29 - 03:18:31] issue uh housing supply has
[03:18:31 - 03:18:31] been in short uh very
[03:18:31 - 03:18:33] short for a long period
[03:18:33 - 03:18:33] of time so prices have
[03:18:33 - 03:18:35] gone up and given that
[03:18:35 - 03:18:38] we are in high interest
[03:18:38 - 03:18:38] rate time uh it's been
[03:18:38 - 03:18:40] uh causing a lot of
[03:18:40 - 03:18:42] affordability issues so that's going
[03:18:42 - 03:18:45] to persist regardless of what
[03:18:45 - 03:18:45] the fomc does uh because
[03:18:45 - 03:18:47] supply has so has been
[03:18:47 - 03:18:47] so short it is likely
[03:18:47 - 03:18:50] to continue consumers are also
[03:18:50 - 03:18:52] slowing uh the retail sales
[03:18:52 - 03:18:52] have started to slow in
[03:18:54 - 03:18:54] general people are not going
[03:18:54 - 03:18:55] out and making large purchases
[03:18:55 - 03:18:57] because of the uncertainty out
[03:18:57 - 03:18:58] there this has a big
[03:19:00 - 03:19:00] impact on our economy because
[03:19:00 - 03:19:02] 70 of our economy is
[03:19:02 - 03:19:02] driven by consumers so as
[03:19:04 - 03:19:04] consumers start slowing down our
[03:19:06 - 03:19:06] economy is expected to slow
[03:19:06 - 03:19:09] as well so in general
[03:19:09 - 03:19:09] the fed funds rate cut
[03:19:09 - 03:19:11] is likely uh in september
[03:19:11 - 03:19:13] there's also another one that's
[03:19:13 - 03:19:15] expected possibly in october or
[03:19:15 - 03:19:15] december so we just have
[03:19:16 - 03:19:17] to get our heads wrapped
[03:19:17 - 03:19:19] around the fact that we
[03:19:19 - 03:19:19] will start seeing lower rates
[03:19:21 - 03:19:21] the treasury yield curve is
[03:19:21 - 03:19:23] something that we always look
[03:19:23 - 03:19:25] to uh right now you'll
[03:19:25 - 03:19:25] see it's an inverted yield
[03:19:25 - 03:19:27] curve so those higher term
[03:19:27 - 03:19:30] rates or higher rates are
[03:19:30 - 03:19:30] being paid on the shorter
[03:19:30 - 03:19:31] term investments versus the long-term
[03:19:34 - 03:19:34] investments in a normal market
[03:19:36 - 03:19:36] environment we would see a
[03:19:36 - 03:19:39] sloped curve with the overnight
[03:19:39 - 03:19:41] rate paying much lower than
[03:19:41 - 03:19:41] the longer term rate so
[03:19:42 - 03:19:42] we've been in this inverted
[03:19:42 - 03:19:44] yield environment for about 2
[03:19:44 - 03:19:47] years now if the fomc
[03:19:47 - 03:19:47] does start making uh changes
[03:19:47 - 03:19:49] to the fed funds rate
[03:19:49 - 03:19:52] we would expect that curve
[03:19:52 - 03:19:52] to start normalizing so hopefully
[03:19:53 - 03:19:53] that's what we will see
[03:19:53 - 03:19:57] if they do indeed start
[03:19:57 - 03:19:58] making rate cuts we included
[03:19:58 - 03:19:58] this just so you could
[03:19:58 - 03:20:01] see the es and flows
[03:20:01 - 03:20:01] over time uh this is
[03:20:03 - 03:20:03] just looking at the various
[03:20:03 - 03:20:06] us treasury rates over a
[03:20:06 - 03:20:06] period of time so you
[03:20:06 - 03:20:08] can see consistencies with where
[03:20:08 - 03:20:10] we're at versus where we
[03:20:10 - 03:20:10] have been uh if you
[03:20:13 - 03:20:13] look at the september 2006
[03:20:13 - 03:20:16] all the way to september
[03:20:16 - 03:20:16] 2009 you see the rate
[03:20:18 - 03:20:18] falls that was when we
[03:20:18 - 03:20:21] had uh the housing crisis
[03:20:21 - 03:20:21] so we had rates cut
[03:20:21 - 03:20:23] very quickly we were had
[03:20:23 - 03:20:25] a prolonged period of time
[03:20:25 - 03:20:25] where the rates were very
[03:20:25 - 03:20:27] low the great recession and
[03:20:27 - 03:20:29] then we had rates start
[03:20:29 - 03:20:29] to improve before covid came
[03:20:30 - 03:20:30] along and then they went
[03:20:30 - 03:20:33] through their emergency uh protocol
[03:20:33 - 03:20:34] and they uh reduced the
[03:20:34 - 03:20:34] fed funds rate very quickly
[03:20:36 - 03:20:36] there as well to try
[03:20:36 - 03:20:39] to help pump some activity
[03:20:39 - 03:20:39] into the economy we have
[03:20:39 - 03:20:40] since gone up as they
[03:20:40 - 03:20:42] were fighting inflation those rates
[03:20:42 - 03:20:42] went really really high but
[03:20:44 - 03:20:44] now we are expected to
[03:20:44 - 03:20:46] start coming down so what
[03:20:46 - 03:20:46] the college has done is
[03:20:48 - 03:20:48] starting to prepare the portfolio
[03:20:48 - 03:20:50] for when those rate cuts
[03:20:50 - 03:20:52] do come because that's the
[03:20:52 - 03:20:52] way to best protect the
[03:20:53 - 03:20:53] interest income that you can
[03:20:53 - 03:20:56] earn on your investments over
[03:20:56 - 03:20:58] time it's important to keep
[03:20:58 - 03:21:01] in mind the investment policy
[03:21:01 - 03:21:01] goals uh so in your
[03:21:02 - 03:21:02] investment policy the objectives are
[03:21:05 - 03:21:05] stated safety of principle you
[03:21:05 - 03:21:06] do have taxpayer dollars so
[03:21:06 - 03:21:09] you are the steward of
[03:21:09 - 03:21:09] their funds uh so maintaining
[03:21:09 - 03:21:11] safety of principle is of
[03:21:11 - 03:21:13] utmost importance you also have
[03:21:13 - 03:21:13] to have to have liquidity
[03:21:15 - 03:21:15] to pay the bills um
[03:21:15 - 03:21:15] so we have to make
[03:21:17 - 03:21:17] sure that you have adequate
[03:21:17 - 03:21:19] liquid funds so cash equivalents
[03:21:19 - 03:21:21] you also maintain the public
[03:21:21 - 03:21:21] trust we do not want
[03:21:24 - 03:21:24] anything that will uh hinder
[03:21:24 - 03:21:25] the public trust in what
[03:21:25 - 03:21:26] the college is doing and
[03:21:27 - 03:21:27] then we would expect risk
[03:21:28 - 03:21:29] commensurate yields so you're not
[03:21:29 - 03:21:32] going out and taking uh
[03:21:32 - 03:21:32] risks that you shouldn't so
[03:21:35 - 03:21:35] there's a lot of um
[03:21:35 - 03:21:37] legislation that controls how public
[03:21:37 - 03:21:39] funds can be invested you
[03:21:39 - 03:21:39] have to stay within those
[03:21:41 - 03:21:41] parameters so rates are not
[03:21:41 - 03:21:42] going to be like what
[03:21:42 - 03:21:42] you would see in your
[03:21:42 - 03:21:45] personal portfolio where risk is
[03:21:45 - 03:21:47] higher risk is very very
[03:21:47 - 03:21:47] low because you have taxpayer
[03:21:48 - 03:21:48] dollars so those yield should
[03:21:48 - 03:21:50] be consistent with what the
[03:21:50 - 03:21:52] market's offering just as a
[03:21:52 - 03:21:54] reminder the maximum uh maturity
[03:21:54 - 03:21:57] for your portfolio is three
[03:21:57 - 03:21:57] years and then the max
[03:21:57 - 03:21:59] wham the weighted average maturity
[03:21:59 - 03:22:00] is two years you have
[03:22:00 - 03:22:02] not bumped up against that
[03:22:02 - 03:22:02] but it's just something to
[03:22:02 - 03:22:04] be aware of um we
[03:22:04 - 03:22:06] don't want your investments going
[03:22:06 - 03:22:06] too far uh to the
[03:22:09 - 03:22:09] three-year so um you do
[03:22:09 - 03:22:12] have that wham put in
[03:22:12 - 03:22:12] there to protect you from
[03:22:14 - 03:22:16] liquidity issues we wanted you
[03:22:16 - 03:22:16] to see the es and
[03:22:16 - 03:22:18] flows of your portfolio value
[03:22:18 - 03:22:20] this is very typical of
[03:22:20 - 03:22:22] a community college you bring
[03:22:22 - 03:22:22] in tax revenue and you're
[03:22:22 - 03:22:24] spending down the rest of
[03:22:24 - 03:22:26] the year this might shift
[03:22:26 - 03:22:26] a little bit given that
[03:22:26 - 03:22:28] the state appropriations changed now
[03:22:28 - 03:22:30] that you're getting half of
[03:22:30 - 03:22:32] your funds in october um
[03:22:32 - 03:22:32] we might see a little
[03:22:32 - 03:22:35] bit higher uh in that
[03:22:35 - 03:22:35] december quarter end uh but
[03:22:37 - 03:22:37] consistently you will probably continue
[03:22:40 - 03:22:40] to see the same pattern
[03:22:42 - 03:22:42] this is your weighted average
[03:22:42 - 03:22:43] yield so this is about
[03:22:43 - 03:22:46] what the portfolio has been
[03:22:46 - 03:22:46] earning over time so i
[03:22:46 - 03:22:48] just wanted to point out
[03:22:48 - 03:22:48] we have been we have
[03:22:48 - 03:22:50] had higher rates for a
[03:22:50 - 03:22:52] long period of time things
[03:22:52 - 03:22:52] are starting to come down
[03:22:52 - 03:22:54] so you will see that
[03:22:54 - 03:22:54] yield curve it will start
[03:22:56 - 03:22:56] coming down naturally there's nothing
[03:22:58 - 03:22:58] anyone can do about it
[03:22:58 - 03:23:00] as rates come down your
[03:23:00 - 03:23:00] portfolio yield will come down
[03:23:03 - 03:23:03] as well the goal is
[03:23:03 - 03:23:06] to have it come down
[03:23:06 - 03:23:06] slowly relative to other uh
[03:23:07 - 03:23:07] investment options out there like
[03:23:10 - 03:23:12] short-term investments so when i
[03:23:12 - 03:23:12] was here last year we
[03:23:12 - 03:23:14] looked at the composition of
[03:23:14 - 03:23:16] the june 30 of 2024
[03:23:16 - 03:23:16] and some of the recommendations
[03:23:20 - 03:23:20] that we had you had
[03:23:20 - 03:23:23] a 6535 split of your
[03:23:23 - 03:23:23] portfolio so you had about
[03:23:23 - 03:23:26] 65 cash 35 in fixed
[03:23:26 - 03:23:30] income the goal that we
[03:23:30 - 03:23:30] suggested was about 35 or
[03:23:30 - 03:23:33] 50 cash 50 uh fixed
[03:23:33 - 03:23:35] income we also discussed uh
[03:23:35 - 03:23:38] considering collateralized cds and money
[03:23:38 - 03:23:40] market accounts diversifying your um
[03:23:40 - 03:23:40] local government investment pools and
[03:23:42 - 03:23:42] cash equivalents in general just
[03:23:42 - 03:23:50] because so this shows the
[03:23:50 - 03:23:53] composition the top left corners
[03:23:53 - 03:23:55] that's june 2024 uh bottom
[03:23:55 - 03:23:55] right corner june 2025 so
[03:23:56 - 03:23:57] if you were to look
[03:23:57 - 03:23:57] at these charts and i
[03:23:58 - 03:23:58] know that the numbers are
[03:23:58 - 03:24:01] hard to see here but
[03:24:01 - 03:24:01] in june of 2024 you
[03:24:01 - 03:24:04] had a 6535 mix when
[03:24:04 - 03:24:04] we got to june of
[03:24:04 - 03:24:07] third uh june of 2025
[03:24:07 - 03:24:07] you had a 4654 split
[03:24:09 - 03:24:09] so you were much closer
[03:24:09 - 03:24:13] to that 50 50 split
[03:24:13 - 03:24:13] which was great to see
[03:24:15 - 03:24:15] so when we were going
[03:24:15 - 03:24:17] back you got to that
[03:24:17 - 03:24:17] 50 ladder with fixed income
[03:24:18 - 03:24:19] you did consider collateralized cds
[03:24:20 - 03:24:23] you actually purchased a cd
[03:24:23 - 03:24:26] um to have 10 of
[03:24:26 - 03:24:26] your portfolio held in that
[03:24:26 - 03:24:27] cd and then you diversified
[03:24:27 - 03:24:28] the local government investment pools
[03:24:28 - 03:24:31] and money market fund options
[03:24:31 - 03:24:31] that you had if you
[03:24:33 - 03:24:33] look back at this chart
[03:24:33 - 03:24:37] you had 59 in local
[03:24:37 - 03:24:37] government pools in 2024 in
[03:24:37 - 03:24:39] 2025 that was down to
[03:24:39 - 03:24:40] 30 so you had shifted
[03:24:40 - 03:24:40] some of those funds not
[03:24:40 - 03:24:42] only to fixed income but
[03:24:42 - 03:24:44] also to the money market
[03:24:44 - 03:24:44] funds just to give you
[03:24:44 - 03:24:52] some oops so our current
[03:24:52 - 03:24:54] recommendations the lattering strategy that
[03:24:54 - 03:24:55] you have been implementing is
[03:24:55 - 03:24:57] really the best thing you
[03:24:57 - 03:24:57] can do to guard against
[03:24:57 - 03:24:59] when rates start to fall
[03:24:59 - 03:24:59] so we want you to
[03:25:01 - 03:25:01] continue lading those investments as
[03:25:01 - 03:25:03] you have been anytime you
[03:25:03 - 03:25:05] have maturities come up with
[03:25:05 - 03:25:07] those us treasuries or agencies
[03:25:07 - 03:25:07] that you own we would
[03:25:07 - 03:25:10] highly suggest investing those as
[03:25:10 - 03:25:11] they mature we also wanted
[03:25:11 - 03:25:13] you to consider collateralized cds
[03:25:13 - 03:25:15] at other institutions um and
[03:25:15 - 03:25:17] i wanted to explain collateral
[03:25:17 - 03:25:19] just briefly here just to
[03:25:19 - 03:25:21] make sure everyone's comfortable with
[03:25:21 - 03:25:21] how it works so that
[03:25:21 - 03:25:23] way you can consider uh
[03:25:23 - 03:25:27] banking institutions that are outside
[03:25:27 - 03:25:27] of the the big four
[03:25:27 - 03:25:30] um when you have collateralized
[03:25:30 - 03:25:32] cds the bank can collateralize
[03:25:32 - 03:25:34] so they can offer in
[03:25:34 - 03:25:34] return to protect your funds
[03:25:37 - 03:25:37] securities as collateral a federal
[03:25:37 - 03:25:39] home loan bank letter of
[03:25:39 - 03:25:42] credit or they can use
[03:25:42 - 03:25:42] fdic insurance so all of
[03:25:42 - 03:25:43] those are eligible under the
[03:25:43 - 03:25:46] public funds collateral act so
[03:25:46 - 03:25:46] when you go to a
[03:25:46 - 03:25:49] bank um it can be
[03:25:49 - 03:25:51] a smaller more localized more
[03:25:51 - 03:25:51] regionalized bank they can offer
[03:25:53 - 03:25:53] that collateral and your funds
[03:25:53 - 03:25:55] are always protected so i
[03:25:55 - 03:25:57] wanted to make sure that
[03:25:57 - 03:25:57] you all were comfortable with
[03:25:59 - 03:25:59] that if your staff were
[03:25:59 - 03:26:01] to go out and find
[03:26:01 - 03:26:01] a regional bank that's paying
[03:26:01 - 03:26:03] a higher rate than one
[03:26:03 - 03:26:06] of the big four banks
[03:26:06 - 03:26:06] um they always have to
[03:26:06 - 03:26:08] offer you collateral so your
[03:26:08 - 03:26:10] funds are always protected so
[03:26:10 - 03:26:10] i don't want that to
[03:26:12 - 03:26:12] scare anyone there are good
[03:26:13 - 03:26:13] opportunities out there with some
[03:26:13 - 03:26:15] of your more regional banks
[03:26:15 - 03:26:17] so we want to make
[03:26:17 - 03:26:17] sure that that's an option
[03:26:17 - 03:26:20] for you the goals of
[03:26:20 - 03:26:20] lading though are to hedge
[03:26:22 - 03:26:22] future rate decreases that's absolutely
[03:26:24 - 03:26:24] uh what we would recommend
[03:26:24 - 03:26:26] that you do and it
[03:26:26 - 03:26:28] also stabilizes your interest income
[03:26:28 - 03:26:28] for your budget so it
[03:26:28 - 03:26:30] makes it much easier to
[03:26:30 - 03:26:30] plan uh for the future
[03:26:33 - 03:26:33] about how much income you
[03:26:33 - 03:26:36] anticipate coming in so that
[03:26:36 - 03:26:37] way you're prepared rates are
[03:26:37 - 03:26:37] going to start coming down
[03:26:38 - 03:26:39] so we would expect that
[03:26:39 - 03:26:40] that interest income estimate would
[03:26:40 - 03:26:42] start coming down with it
[03:26:42 - 03:26:42] uh but it is always
[03:26:42 - 03:26:44] helpful to have that in
[03:26:44 - 03:26:44] the back of your mind
[03:26:44 - 03:26:48] uh for extra income we
[03:26:48 - 03:26:48] also want you to consider
[03:26:48 - 03:26:50] higher yielding money market account
[03:26:50 - 03:26:52] options so money market accounts
[03:26:52 - 03:26:55] are different than local government
[03:26:55 - 03:26:57] pools and money market funds
[03:26:57 - 03:26:57] a money market account is
[03:27:00 - 03:27:00] actually a deposit at a
[03:27:00 - 03:27:02] bank and similar to cds
[03:27:02 - 03:27:04] they will actually be collateralized
[03:27:04 - 03:27:06] so they're fully protected and
[03:27:06 - 03:27:06] one of the options that
[03:27:09 - 03:27:09] we've seen a lot lately
[03:27:09 - 03:27:11] is called ics it used
[03:27:11 - 03:27:11] to be called insured cash
[03:27:11 - 03:27:13] sweep it's now the intrify
[03:27:13 - 03:27:15] services cash account um it's
[03:27:15 - 03:27:17] managed by a company called
[03:27:17 - 03:27:17] intrify and what they do
[03:27:17 - 03:27:20] it's a spread program so
[03:27:20 - 03:27:22] you have one bank relationship
[03:27:22 - 03:27:22] they're paying you a rate
[03:27:26 - 03:27:26] that they set um at
[03:27:26 - 03:27:28] the ic level and then
[03:27:28 - 03:27:28] when your funds go into
[03:27:28 - 03:27:30] that bank they are spread
[03:27:30 - 03:27:32] to various banks that are
[03:27:32 - 03:27:32] part of that interfy network
[03:27:32 - 03:27:35] in under 250 000 increments
[03:27:35 - 03:27:38] so you have fdic insurance
[03:27:38 - 03:27:40] with various banks across the
[03:27:40 - 03:27:40] nation but you have one
[03:27:41 - 03:27:44] relationship with that banking institution
[03:27:44 - 03:27:44] so it's just a way
[03:27:44 - 03:27:46] for government entities to be
[03:27:46 - 03:27:49] able to invest more than
[03:27:49 - 03:27:49] 250 000 in any one
[03:27:49 - 03:27:52] bank and still have fdic
[03:27:52 - 03:27:54] insurance so that has become
[03:27:54 - 03:27:54] a pretty prevalent option out
[03:27:56 - 03:27:56] there and it's possible that
[03:27:56 - 03:27:58] you may be approached with
[03:27:58 - 03:27:58] a bank that offers that
[03:28:01 - 03:28:01] so it is a tool
[03:28:01 - 03:28:02] that is available um and
[03:28:02 - 03:28:02] it's something that i just
[03:28:02 - 03:28:04] want you to be comfortable
[03:28:04 - 03:28:07] with we do anticipate lower
[03:28:07 - 03:28:09] yields coming so as i
[03:28:09 - 03:28:11] mentioned lading those investments your
[03:28:11 - 03:28:11] staff has done a really
[03:28:11 - 03:28:12] good job of getting those
[03:28:12 - 03:28:14] investments all the way out
[03:28:14 - 03:28:14] to three years that's going
[03:28:14 - 03:28:16] to protect you over time
[03:28:16 - 03:28:17] so we would recommend that
[03:28:17 - 03:28:23] they continue with that i
[03:28:23 - 03:28:23] can keep going with any
[03:28:23 - 03:28:25] questions you have like i
[03:28:25 - 03:28:25] said happy to talk about
[03:28:26 - 03:28:26] anything that we didn't cover
[03:28:26 - 03:28:29] but i wanted to give
[03:28:29 - 03:28:33] you a general overview thank
[03:28:33 - 03:28:36] you trustees any questions trusty
[03:28:36 - 03:28:39] wilson um you know every
[03:28:39 - 03:28:39] day i listen to the
[03:28:42 - 03:28:42] radio and one station says
[03:28:42 - 03:28:43] uh the federal reserve is
[03:28:43 - 03:28:45] going to lower interest and
[03:28:45 - 03:28:45] i turn it to another
[03:28:48 - 03:28:48] station and something and i
[03:28:48 - 03:28:50] read one magazine that says
[03:28:50 - 03:28:50] one thing and i read
[03:28:53 - 03:28:53] another one and it just
[03:28:53 - 03:28:55] the constant amount of information
[03:28:55 - 03:28:59] you get and the varying
[03:28:59 - 03:29:01] um views that all these
[03:29:01 - 03:29:05] different people have makes you
[03:29:05 - 03:29:09] know my mind is swimming
[03:29:09 - 03:29:09] and you know i i
[03:29:09 - 03:29:11] i can't i can't i
[03:29:11 - 03:29:11] can't keep up with it
[03:29:14 - 03:29:14] but you know and uh
[03:29:14 - 03:29:18] the tariffs i really uh
[03:29:18 - 03:29:18] you know personally i i
[03:29:18 - 03:29:22] have a business and uh
[03:29:22 - 03:29:25] that purchased from overseas and
[03:29:25 - 03:29:25] i've been doing it and
[03:29:25 - 03:29:29] now i'm the product's got
[03:29:29 - 03:29:29] a 50 tariff on it
[03:29:32 - 03:29:32] and i'm pretty much out
[03:29:32 - 03:29:34] of business i can't be
[03:29:34 - 03:29:34] competitive and that's what the
[03:29:37 - 03:29:37] administration wants and that i'm
[03:29:37 - 03:29:40] not sure how that whole
[03:29:40 - 03:29:44] long-term tariff thing is going
[03:29:44 - 03:29:44] to shake out and um
[03:29:44 - 03:29:47] you know i i i
[03:29:47 - 03:29:47] do suspect that with the
[03:29:50 - 03:29:50] lower interest rates our yield
[03:29:50 - 03:29:54] here at the college will
[03:29:54 - 03:29:54] be going down a little
[03:29:55 - 03:29:55] bit so i think we
[03:29:55 - 03:29:55] have to be bit so
[03:29:56 - 03:29:56] i think we have to
[03:29:57 - 03:30:00] be realistically realistically realist about
[03:30:00 - 03:30:03] that and me personally uh
[03:30:03 - 03:30:03] i i don't have a
[03:30:03 - 03:30:05] problem with dealing with regional
[03:30:05 - 03:30:09] banks in fact i've been
[03:30:09 - 03:30:12] more successful in banking relationships
[03:30:12 - 03:30:16] with regional banks than the
[03:30:16 - 03:30:16] the big banks so u
[03:30:19 - 03:30:23] uh you i'm i'm glad
[03:30:23 - 03:30:23] i don't have your job

[03:31:20 - 03:31:22] 2025 2025 and with your
[03:31:22 - 03:31:24] permission madame chair if there
[03:31:24 - 03:31:24] are questions dr sher han
[03:31:25 - 03:31:25] senior vice chancellor of finance
[03:31:25 - 03:31:28] and administration will answer all
[03:31:28 - 03:31:29] administration will answer all questions
[03:31:29 - 03:31:32] questions thank you thank you
[03:31:32 - 03:31:36] chancellor board and board chair
[03:31:36 - 03:31:36] um we're doing well financially
[03:31:37 - 03:31:37] once again we're coming to
[03:31:37 - 03:31:41] the end of our fiscal
[03:31:41 - 03:31:41] year we've seen almost a
[03:31:43 - 03:31:43] realization of almost 100 of
[03:31:43 - 03:31:45] the revenue we expected at
[03:31:45 - 03:31:49] 97 out of the 465
[03:31:49 - 03:31:49] million of the budget for
[03:31:49 - 03:31:52] fy25 um you're probably aware
[03:31:52 - 03:31:55] of this salaries what i
[03:31:55 - 03:31:58] call loaded wage salaries and
[03:31:58 - 03:32:00] benefits represent 67 of our
[03:32:00 - 03:32:02] expenses there's another large category
[03:32:02 - 03:32:05] contra contracted services representing 8
[03:32:05 - 03:32:07] so those two elements represent
[03:32:07 - 03:32:10] threequarters of our expenses but
[03:32:10 - 03:32:10] we're managing managing them well
[03:32:12 - 03:32:12] on the investment side we
[03:32:12 - 03:32:15] have 2 1 million of
[03:32:15 - 03:32:17] uh unrealized gain that means
[03:32:17 - 03:32:17] nothing was sold but for
[03:32:17 - 03:32:21] the book value has increased
[03:32:21 - 03:32:24] by that amount and the
[03:32:24 - 03:32:24] balance sheet just to make
[03:32:24 - 03:32:27] it a complete report once
[03:32:27 - 03:32:28] again we're doing better than
[03:32:28 - 03:32:28] we were doing in the
[03:32:28 - 03:32:36] pri current assets this year
[03:32:36 - 03:32:38] because we have improved accounts
[03:32:38 - 03:32:41] receivable collections in general so
[03:32:41 - 03:32:44] a slight improvement of roughly
[03:32:44 - 03:32:44] 5 million and likewise we
[03:32:46 - 03:32:46] have a little more on
[03:32:46 - 03:32:47] the long-term investment side i
[03:32:47 - 03:32:49] think emily addressed some of
[03:32:49 - 03:32:49] that in her discussion so
[03:32:53 - 03:32:53] we're slightly higher of um
[03:32:54 - 03:33:01] our long-term investments for see
[03:33:01 - 03:33:01] if there's anything else that
[03:33:01 - 03:33:03] we can share we did
[03:33:03 - 03:33:06] share some information about our
[03:33:06 - 03:33:06] bond debt that was sent
[03:33:06 - 03:33:09] out in a ti we
[03:33:09 - 03:33:09] looked at the various uh
[03:33:12 - 03:33:12] expense categories in fund one
[03:33:12 - 03:33:15] and fund 8 across student
[03:33:15 - 03:33:16] revenue bonds loan star notes
[03:33:16 - 03:33:18] limited tax bonds and maintenance
[03:33:18 - 03:33:18] tax notes and we showed
[03:33:18 - 03:33:20] the timing of when each
[03:33:20 - 03:33:21] of those payments occur so
[03:33:21 - 03:33:24] everyone should have that data
[03:33:24 - 03:33:24] and if you have any
[03:33:24 - 03:33:25] questions about the financial reports
[03:33:25 - 03:33:29] i would be happy to
[03:33:29 - 03:33:31] address them thank you trustees
[03:33:34 - 03:33:35] any questions trusty she looks
[03:33:35 - 03:33:35] like from the numbers we're
[03:33:36 - 03:33:38] on track for about a
[03:33:38 - 03:33:40] 1015 millionish dollar surplus for
[03:33:40 - 03:33:40] the year is that still
[03:33:41 - 03:33:43] accurate or actually i don't
[03:33:43 - 03:33:43] think so i think it
[03:33:45 - 03:33:45] can be a little less
[03:33:45 - 03:33:45] i would if i had
[03:33:46 - 03:33:46] to venture a guess i
[03:33:46 - 03:33:47] would say between 6 and
[03:33:47 - 03:33:49] 8 million okay we're going
[03:33:49 - 03:33:49] to have a soft close
[03:33:52 - 03:33:52] probably next week sometime early
[03:33:52 - 03:33:54] next week and then shortly
[03:33:54 - 03:33:57] thereafter a final close but
[03:33:57 - 03:33:57] i'm guessing because of the
[03:34:00 - 03:34:00] additional uh volume of students
[03:34:00 - 03:34:02] that we have now and
[03:34:02 - 03:34:04] additional staffing costs we're eating
[03:34:04 - 03:34:04] into that 10 million a
[03:34:05 - 03:34:05] little bit so okay no
[03:34:06 - 03:34:07] thanks it's good news though
[03:34:17 - 03:34:17] well we're ready to vote
[03:34:17 - 03:34:19] on item b investment report

[03:36:54 - 03:36:54] goal number one increase student
[03:36:58 - 03:36:58] persistence from 59 to 61

[03:37:00 - 03:37:03] will be able to reach
[03:37:03 - 03:37:03] this goal the data have
[03:37:03 - 03:37:08] not yet come in for
[03:37:08 - 03:37:08] the fall 24 and the
[03:37:08 - 03:37:10] 25 uh semester uh it's
[03:37:10 - 03:37:12] primarily because we're waiting for
[03:37:12 - 03:37:13] those students to transfer and
[03:37:13 - 03:37:13] for us to get that
[03:37:16 - 03:37:16] information and then we'll be
[03:37:16 - 03:37:19] able to certainly certify that
[03:37:19 - 03:37:22] we'll be able to have
[03:37:22 - 03:37:22] the 59 as the baseline
[03:37:22 - 03:37:26] right now it is anticipated
[03:37:26 - 03:37:26] but our target is 61
[03:37:29 - 03:37:29] the stretch goal 63 the
[03:37:29 - 03:37:31] second goal help more students
[03:37:31 - 03:37:34] metriculate through their developmental sequence
[03:37:34 - 03:37:37] by 5 once again you
[03:37:37 - 03:37:37] see the numbers there and
[03:37:37 - 03:37:41] we have a stretch goal
[03:37:41 - 03:37:42] of 6 goal three grow
[03:37:42 - 03:37:45] enrollments and credentials of value
[03:37:45 - 03:37:48] by 5 and of course
[03:37:48 - 03:37:48] with that you see the
[03:37:50 - 03:37:50] baseline as well we want
[03:37:50 - 03:37:53] to achieve annual growth of
[03:37:53 - 03:37:56] 5 in credentials of value
[03:37:56 - 03:37:59] the bachelor's associates semester credit
[03:37:59 - 03:38:01] hour certificates academic transfer courses
[03:38:01 - 03:38:04] occupational skill assessment awards and
[03:38:04 - 03:38:06] of course the institutional certifications
[03:38:06 - 03:38:12] for lensure as well next
[03:38:12 - 03:38:12] is goal four increase the
[03:38:12 - 03:38:15] number of students who are
[03:38:15 - 03:38:17] persisting to a balora degree
[03:38:17 - 03:38:21] and grow enrollment by 10
[03:38:21 - 03:38:21] there is continuous interest in
[03:38:21 - 03:38:24] our balora degree programs and
[03:38:24 - 03:38:26] one of the things that
[03:38:26 - 03:38:26] the presidents have done is
[03:38:28 - 03:38:28] that they have focused on
[03:38:28 - 03:38:30] the commit to complete for
[03:38:30 - 03:38:30] the students and as was
[03:38:32 - 03:38:32] mentioned earlier for the early
[03:38:32 - 03:38:35] college high school students they
[03:38:35 - 03:38:38] are also being invited to
[03:38:38 - 03:38:40] get additional information about these
[03:38:40 - 03:38:43] balora degree programs so that
[03:38:43 - 03:38:43] they also can enroll with
[03:38:43 - 03:38:45] us at a community college
[03:38:45 - 03:38:48] price you see the stretch
[03:38:48 - 03:38:50] goal there of 50 and
[03:38:50 - 03:38:50] you see the baseline and
[03:38:50 - 03:38:53] the target that we have
[03:38:53 - 03:38:56] set as well next is
[03:38:56 - 03:38:59] the houston reconnect program which
[03:38:59 - 03:38:59] is an excellent program 50
[03:38:59 - 03:39:01] of students entering houston reconnect
[03:39:01 - 03:39:03] earn an award within one
[03:39:03 - 03:39:06] year and this is what
[03:39:06 - 03:39:06] we have been focusing on
[03:39:06 - 03:39:09] with the instructional and student
[03:39:09 - 03:39:11] services area and of course
[03:39:11 - 03:39:11] with financial aid as well
[03:39:14 - 03:39:14] to ensure that all of
[03:39:14 - 03:39:16] the information that students will
[03:39:16 - 03:39:18] need would be available to
[03:39:18 - 03:39:18] them to immediately sign up
[03:39:20 - 03:39:20] for the program information was
[03:39:22 - 03:39:22] provided earlier about the number
[03:39:22 - 03:39:25] of students who've already completed
[03:39:25 - 03:39:27] their application so we're looking
[03:39:27 - 03:39:31] forward to expanding our outreach
[03:39:31 - 03:39:34] throughout the community in order
[03:39:34 - 03:39:34] to ensure that more residents
[03:39:34 - 03:39:36] of the community are aware
[03:39:36 - 03:39:38] of this presidents also are
[03:39:38 - 03:39:40] working with their advisory committees
[03:39:40 - 03:39:42] to make sure that their
[03:39:42 - 03:39:44] workforce advisory committee members are
[03:39:44 - 03:39:46] aware of the opportunities as
[03:39:46 - 03:39:46] well for those persons who
[03:39:46 - 03:39:48] are currently employed in the
[03:39:48 - 03:39:53] workforce and would seek that
[03:39:53 - 03:39:54] opportunity to upskill and of
[03:39:54 - 03:39:54] course the stretch goal there
[03:39:54 - 03:39:57] is 60 to earn a
[03:39:57 - 03:40:00] credential next is the create
[03:40:00 - 03:40:01] the lvn to adn pathway
[03:40:01 - 03:40:04] we're really very delighted with
[03:40:04 - 03:40:04] all of the successes that
[03:40:04 - 03:40:05] have come with the work
[03:40:05 - 03:40:05] that has been done through
[03:40:08 - 03:40:08] coleman college of health sciences
[03:40:08 - 03:40:10] to get us to this
[03:40:10 - 03:40:13] point we understand that while
[03:40:13 - 03:40:13] the board of nurse examiners
[03:40:13 - 03:40:15] did approve our offering this
[03:40:16 - 03:40:18] opportunity for 30 students in
[03:40:18 - 03:40:18] the fall and 30 in
[03:40:20 - 03:40:20] the spring it was determined
[03:40:20 - 03:40:22] by the college that 20
[03:40:22 - 03:40:24] students would be great because
[03:40:24 - 03:40:24] we're looking at ensuring that
[03:40:27 - 03:40:27] these students are able to
[03:40:27 - 03:40:29] perform in a way in
[03:40:29 - 03:40:29] that they're able to certainly
[03:40:34 - 03:40:34] reach that 85 pass rate
[03:40:34 - 03:40:37] as we prepare and was
[03:40:37 - 03:40:39] mentioned earlier as well as
[03:40:39 - 03:40:39] we look at allied health
[03:40:39 - 03:40:42] and particularly with nursing that
[03:40:42 - 03:40:45] this is a career pathway
[03:40:45 - 03:40:45] in nursing that is in
[03:40:47 - 03:40:47] high demand and we want
[03:40:47 - 03:40:50] to help fill that gap
[03:40:50 - 03:40:50] so we will start focusing
[03:40:50 - 03:40:54] on preparing for two years
[03:40:54 - 03:40:56] at least for our students
[03:40:56 - 03:40:56] to be able to move
[03:40:56 - 03:41:00] into that pathway uh with
[03:41:00 - 03:41:07] potentially the the rn number
[03:41:07 - 03:41:09] seven update hcc's technology infrastructure
[03:41:09 - 03:41:12] by installing software and hardware
[03:41:12 - 03:41:14] updates and develop a technology
[03:41:14 - 03:41:14] master plan we see the
[03:41:14 - 03:41:16] goals and the objectives of
[03:41:16 - 03:41:19] course that are there and
[03:41:19 - 03:41:22] i did receive additional information
[03:41:22 - 03:41:22] from the uh chair one
[03:41:22 - 03:41:25] of the trustees on that
[03:41:25 - 03:41:25] as well and so we'll
[03:41:28 - 03:41:28] be including that information in
[03:41:28 - 03:41:31] terms of some of the
[03:41:31 - 03:41:33] activities and actions that we
[03:41:33 - 03:41:33] can address but certainly we're
[03:41:36 - 03:41:36] open to the board for
[03:41:36 - 03:41:39] discussion about how you'd like
[03:41:39 - 03:41:39] for us to amend that
[03:41:39 - 03:41:47] uh number eight is update
[03:41:47 - 03:41:50] the hc facilities master plan
[03:41:50 - 03:41:50] and continue to execute the
[03:41:53 - 03:41:53] deferred maintenance plan you see
[03:41:53 - 03:41:56] the objective there and we
[03:41:56 - 03:42:00] are certainly looking at that
[03:42:00 - 03:42:04] 15 and not trying to
[03:42:04 - 03:42:07] stay below that um that
[03:42:07 - 03:42:07] 15 or above uh below
