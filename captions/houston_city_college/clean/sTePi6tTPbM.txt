[00:32:00 - 00:32:03] and benefit from the resources
[00:32:03 - 00:32:06] afforded to all stakeholders in
[00:32:06 - 00:32:06] addition to providing affordable uh
[00:32:09 - 00:32:09] providing um in addition to
[00:32:09 - 00:32:11] providing a studentoriented space for
[00:32:11 - 00:32:15] students to work to do
[00:32:15 - 00:32:15] work in the libraries we
[00:32:16 - 00:32:16] also provide services to support
[00:32:16 - 00:32:20] the classroom library services are
[00:32:20 - 00:32:22] keen on assessing data and
[00:32:22 - 00:32:25] this is evident in the
[00:32:25 - 00:32:25] increased number of library webpage
[00:32:27 - 00:32:28] views and database downloads both
[00:32:31 - 00:32:31] library web views and database
[00:32:31 - 00:32:33] downloads are up from the
[00:32:33 - 00:32:35] previous academic year as you
[00:32:35 - 00:32:35] can tell by this slide
[00:32:35 - 00:32:38] the librarians are instrumental in
[00:32:38 - 00:32:39] providing library instruction where they
[00:32:39 - 00:32:41] hold interactive learning sessions to
[00:32:41 - 00:32:43] help students learn how to
[00:32:43 - 00:32:47] use the library resources how
[00:32:47 - 00:32:49] to site appropriately and to
[00:32:49 - 00:32:49] help with any research questions
[00:32:52 - 00:32:52] additionally the team understands the
[00:32:55 - 00:32:55] value of continuous improvement the
[00:32:57 - 00:32:57] team has effectively created an
[00:32:57 - 00:32:58] team has effectively created an
[00:32:58 - 00:33:01] interactive interactive uh chat box
[00:33:01 - 00:33:02] and are intentionally increasing their
[00:33:02 - 00:33:07] understanding of artificial intelligence to
[00:33:07 - 00:33:07] further the request for continuous
[00:33:09 - 00:33:09] improvement the library will implement
[00:33:12 - 00:33:12] a new library management system
[00:33:12 - 00:33:14] that was approved by the
[00:33:14 - 00:33:14] board a while back that
[00:33:17 - 00:33:17] will approve the students user
[00:33:17 - 00:33:20] interface and will continue to
[00:33:20 - 00:33:22] review library survey results and
[00:33:22 - 00:33:26] make any changes warranted from
[00:33:26 - 00:33:28] the library survey tutoring is
[00:33:28 - 00:33:30] also experiencing significant increases in
[00:33:30 - 00:33:33] visits tutoring sessions and tutoring
[00:33:33 - 00:33:36] hours the success rates of
[00:33:36 - 00:33:39] these students of those students
[00:33:39 - 00:33:41] who attend tutoring are generally
[00:33:41 - 00:33:41] higher than those students who
[00:33:43 - 00:33:47] do not math results are
[00:33:47 - 00:33:49] interesting we are actually encouraged
[00:33:49 - 00:33:51] by the numbers because we
[00:33:51 - 00:33:53] believe that the math students
[00:33:53 - 00:33:55] attending these sessions are those
[00:33:55 - 00:33:55] who really need the assistance
[00:33:55 - 00:33:58] we have been able to
[00:33:58 - 00:34:00] help many students be successful
[00:34:00 - 00:34:03] as you might suspect students
[00:34:03 - 00:34:03] need more help in english
[00:34:03 - 00:34:07] and mathematic courses dr pettis
[00:34:07 - 00:34:07] the i can't see the
[00:34:07 - 00:34:10] bottom but what is your
[00:34:10 - 00:34:12] source for this data the
[00:34:12 - 00:34:12] tutoring the the source is
[00:34:12 - 00:34:14] the uh the stu the
[00:34:14 - 00:34:16] the tutoring academic database that
[00:34:16 - 00:34:18] they have and then h
[00:34:18 - 00:34:18] how do we come up
[00:34:18 - 00:34:20] with these numbers in that
[00:34:20 - 00:34:22] database like are these tests
[00:34:22 - 00:34:22] that they take are they
[00:34:22 - 00:34:25] what what is this what
[00:34:25 - 00:34:27] is the instrument it's it's
[00:34:27 - 00:34:27] uh it's the results of
[00:34:27 - 00:34:32] their their their um the
[00:34:32 - 00:34:32] students who took these um
[00:34:35 - 00:34:35] the students who were in
[00:34:35 - 00:34:37] tutoring and these are the
[00:34:37 - 00:34:40] results of the courses that
[00:34:40 - 00:34:40] they were enrolled in at
[00:34:40 - 00:34:40] the time that they were
[00:34:41 - 00:34:41] enrolled in at the time
[00:34:42 - 00:34:49] okay okay i'd like that
[00:34:51 - 00:34:51] i mean the important part
[00:34:51 - 00:34:53] here for me um as
[00:34:53 - 00:34:53] the chair of this committee
[00:34:53 - 00:34:55] is and and i'm sure
[00:34:55 - 00:34:55] for my my members is
[00:34:56 - 00:34:59] okay the the source of
[00:34:59 - 00:34:59] the data and you know
[00:35:01 - 00:35:01] yeah what we're looking at
[00:35:01 - 00:35:04] here in terms of numbers
[00:35:06 - 00:35:08] dr buridge so the tutoring
[00:35:08 - 00:35:10] um center keeps very robust
[00:35:10 - 00:35:10] records about which students are
[00:35:12 - 00:35:12] receiving tutoring and for which
[00:35:15 - 00:35:15] courses so what we do
[00:35:15 - 00:35:16] is we take the records
[00:35:16 - 00:35:16] from the tutoring center that
[00:35:18 - 00:35:18] says a particular student received
[00:35:20 - 00:35:20] tutoring for this course and
[00:35:20 - 00:35:22] then we connect it to
[00:35:22 - 00:35:24] the grade information at the
[00:35:24 - 00:35:24] end of the semester since
[00:35:24 - 00:35:26] we know which tutor which
[00:35:26 - 00:35:28] students received tutoring and which
[00:35:28 - 00:35:29] students did not we're able
[00:35:29 - 00:35:30] to compare those two groups
[00:35:32 - 00:35:32] to see how each group
[00:35:32 - 00:35:43] performed at the thank you
[00:35:43 - 00:35:46] dr orange so this is
[00:35:46 - 00:35:46] also the data by subject
[00:35:48 - 00:35:48] area uh the tutoring team
[00:35:48 - 00:35:50] is definitely working hard to
[00:35:50 - 00:35:53] increase the stakeholder engagement with
[00:35:53 - 00:35:55] tutoring we've recently implemented pass
[00:35:55 - 00:35:55] t which is a system
[00:35:58 - 00:35:58] that provides faculty feedback regarding
[00:36:01 - 00:36:01] the students attendance in tutoring
[00:36:04 - 00:36:04] there uh was a question
[00:36:04 - 00:36:07] regarding ai and tutoring uh
[00:36:07 - 00:36:10] tutors are currently using wolfran
[00:36:10 - 00:36:10] alpha in tutoring sessions with
[00:36:13 - 00:36:13] students uh it's it has
[00:36:13 - 00:36:15] become an excellent uh it's
[00:36:15 - 00:36:17] an excellent learning tool that
[00:36:17 - 00:36:17] is used to assist the
[00:36:17 - 00:36:20] students with math especially uh
[00:36:20 - 00:36:23] calculus 1 2 and three
[00:36:23 - 00:36:23] and students can use it
[00:36:23 - 00:36:26] to check their answers gain
[00:36:26 - 00:36:30] a deeper insight into the
[00:36:30 - 00:36:30] mathematical methods and so forth
[00:36:33 - 00:36:33] uh so mo more recently
[00:36:33 - 00:36:35] we're actually we were actually
[00:36:35 - 00:36:35] part of a grant proposal
[00:36:39 - 00:36:39] for an ai assisted writing
[00:36:39 - 00:36:41] improvement uh however the grant
[00:36:41 - 00:36:44] fell through uh due to
[00:36:44 - 00:36:44] the changes in the department
[00:36:44 - 00:36:46] of ed uh the lead
[00:36:46 - 00:36:46] for that grant however has
[00:36:48 - 00:36:48] contacted us that lead was
[00:36:48 - 00:36:51] from the cal from a
[00:36:51 - 00:36:53] california university and has asked
[00:36:53 - 00:36:53] us to participate in a
[00:36:53 - 00:36:55] follow-up opportunity which we are
[00:36:55 - 00:36:57] currently considering so we are
[00:36:57 - 00:37:06] looking at what and then
[00:37:06 - 00:37:06] lastly we talk about our
[00:37:08 - 00:37:08] digital access centers were which
[00:37:08 - 00:37:10] again were were approved by
[00:37:10 - 00:37:13] our board years ago regarding
[00:37:13 - 00:37:13] using hearf dollars to be
[00:37:15 - 00:37:15] able to create these and
[00:37:15 - 00:37:17] there are great resources for
[00:37:17 - 00:37:20] our students to utilize study
[00:37:20 - 00:37:20] rooms or check out lab
[00:37:20 - 00:37:23] laptops within the center all
[00:37:23 - 00:37:25] the centers are being utilized
[00:37:25 - 00:37:27] and students fully recognize and
[00:37:27 - 00:37:30] understand that they are in
[00:37:30 - 00:37:30] place for them to go
[00:37:30 - 00:37:34] for help or to participate
[00:37:34 - 00:37:34] on in their online classes
[00:37:36 - 00:37:36] and we have found these
[00:37:36 - 00:37:38] to be very successful with
[00:37:38 - 00:37:39] our students and of course
[00:37:39 - 00:37:39] these are also available to
[00:37:39 - 00:37:40] our course these are also
[00:37:40 - 00:37:41] available to our community community
[00:37:43 - 00:37:43] so this concludes the presentation
[00:37:43 - 00:37:45] uh i'm here to address
[00:37:45 - 00:37:47] any questions as well as
[00:37:47 - 00:37:49] the team any questions trusty
[00:37:49 - 00:37:51] shiva shiva yeah just so
[00:37:51 - 00:37:53] appreciate the presentation and and
[00:37:53 - 00:37:55] appreciate you um giving some
[00:37:55 - 00:37:57] forethought to my question about
[00:37:57 - 00:37:57] ai tutoring i did want
[00:37:57 - 00:37:59] to lean in on that
[00:37:59 - 00:37:59] a little bit uh so
[00:37:59 - 00:38:00] wolfrrim is an amazing tool
[00:38:00 - 00:38:02] um i remember using that
[00:38:02 - 00:38:02] when i was a student
[00:38:02 - 00:38:06] that was just coming out
[00:38:06 - 00:38:06] in those days um but
[00:38:06 - 00:38:07] um i do think we've
[00:38:07 - 00:38:07] got an exceptional leg up
[00:38:07 - 00:38:09] on most of our competition
[00:38:09 - 00:38:12] because we've got our amazing
[00:38:12 - 00:38:12] ai program uh in house
[00:38:14 - 00:38:14] and i think connecting the
[00:38:14 - 00:38:16] incredible talents that we've got
[00:38:16 - 00:38:18] in that ai department to
[00:38:18 - 00:38:20] develop tools that can help
[00:38:20 - 00:38:20] almost be a mathematics sparring
[00:38:22 - 00:38:22] partner for our students um
[00:38:22 - 00:38:24] could really be a force
[00:38:24 - 00:38:26] multiplier for the really amazing
[00:38:26 - 00:38:26] work that our tutoring team
[00:38:26 - 00:38:28] is doing um so very
[00:38:28 - 00:38:29] much appreciate that you're all
[00:38:29 - 00:38:29] leaning in and i would
[00:38:29 - 00:38:32] just encourage you to continue
[00:38:32 - 00:38:34] doing so um we're seeing
[00:38:34 - 00:38:35] amazing anecdotal results i think
[00:38:35 - 00:38:35] there was a big study
[00:38:35 - 00:38:38] in nigeria that showed incredible
[00:38:38 - 00:38:39] results from a couple of
[00:38:39 - 00:38:39] hours a day of of
[00:38:39 - 00:38:42] tutoring assistance um and as
[00:38:42 - 00:38:44] well as we're seeing uh
[00:38:44 - 00:38:44] k- through2 um private schools
[00:38:45 - 00:38:45] that are starting to really
[00:38:45 - 00:38:47] adopt and leverage uh couple
[00:38:47 - 00:38:49] hours a day of education
[00:38:49 - 00:38:52] and seeing incredible advances in
[00:38:52 - 00:38:52] in progress so just wanted
[00:38:52 - 00:38:54] to say let's let's not
[00:38:54 - 00:38:54] rest on our laurels on
[00:38:55 - 00:38:55] that one the more that
[00:38:55 - 00:38:57] we can leverage our internal
[00:38:57 - 00:38:57] talent to push ahead of
[00:38:57 - 00:38:59] the pack um i think
[00:38:59 - 00:38:59] it it would be well
[00:39:00 - 00:39:02] worth our while so thank
[00:39:02 - 00:39:05] you anything else nope okay

[00:39:54 - 00:39:56] outcomes we've organized this presentation
[00:39:56 - 00:39:58] proceeding from our leading indicators
[00:39:58 - 00:40:01] through our longer term lagging
[00:40:01 - 00:40:05] indicators um concluding with some
[00:40:05 - 00:40:05] information about our um most
[00:40:07 - 00:40:09] important initiatives starting with course
[00:40:09 - 00:40:09] success rates we see an
[00:40:09 - 00:40:13] increase in success rates which
[00:40:13 - 00:40:13] are um a b and
[00:40:18 - 00:40:18] c grades and decreases in
[00:40:18 - 00:40:21] the w d and f
[00:40:21 - 00:40:21] rates which means that our
[00:40:21 - 00:40:23] students are we are increasing
[00:40:23 - 00:40:25] the success within the courses
[00:40:26 - 00:40:26] can you i'm sorry again
[00:40:26 - 00:40:27] because i cannot can you
[00:40:27 - 00:40:27] i'm sorry again because i
[00:40:27 - 00:40:27] cannot see see see okay
[00:40:27 - 00:40:29] okay can you call out
[00:40:29 - 00:40:32] the source please sure um
[00:40:32 - 00:40:32] the source is our student
[00:40:34 - 00:40:34] information system what we do
[00:40:34 - 00:40:37] when we calculate these is
[00:40:37 - 00:40:39] we um essentially extract all
[00:40:39 - 00:40:41] of the students grades across
[00:40:41 - 00:40:41] the courses and then calculate
[00:40:44 - 00:40:44] the percents that the percent
[00:40:44 - 00:40:46] of students who re the
[00:40:46 - 00:40:49] percent of grades that were
[00:40:49 - 00:40:49] a b's and c's and
[00:40:49 - 00:40:51] that gives us that rate
[00:40:51 - 00:40:51] and you can see that
[00:40:51 - 00:40:54] we've um postcoid the success
[00:40:54 - 00:40:57] rate in the fall and
[00:40:57 - 00:40:57] springs dropped to about 72
[00:40:57 - 00:40:59] 6 six and you can
[00:40:59 - 00:40:59] see we've increased up to
[00:40:59 - 00:41:00] and you can see we've
[00:41:00 - 00:41:01] increased up to 76 5
[00:41:01 - 00:41:03] 76 5 which is even
[00:41:03 - 00:41:03] higher than our precoid which
[00:41:03 - 00:41:04] is even higher than our
[00:41:04 - 00:41:05] precoid rates rates thank you
[00:41:08 - 00:41:08] um similarly and these data
[00:41:08 - 00:41:10] are extracted sim similarly what
[00:41:10 - 00:41:13] we do here is we
[00:41:13 - 00:41:13] look at all of the
[00:41:13 - 00:41:15] grades for particular courses and
[00:41:15 - 00:41:17] the success rate across the
[00:41:17 - 00:41:17] courses and when we look
[00:41:17 - 00:41:19] at the last four years
[00:41:19 - 00:41:22] coming out of covid we
[00:41:22 - 00:41:22] again see an increasing trend
[00:41:22 - 00:41:24] now these courses were selected
[00:41:24 - 00:41:25] because they are some of
[00:41:25 - 00:41:28] our gateway courses which are
[00:41:28 - 00:41:28] the large firstear courses that
[00:41:30 - 00:41:30] students typically take as they
[00:41:30 - 00:41:36] enter the institution um we
[00:41:36 - 00:41:36] also present the retention and
[00:41:38 - 00:41:38] persistence rates retention is a
[00:41:38 - 00:41:41] rate at which students remain
[00:41:41 - 00:41:43] enrolled at hcc and persistence
[00:41:43 - 00:41:43] is a rate at which
[00:41:43 - 00:41:45] they remain enrolled at the
[00:41:45 - 00:41:48] same institution that's hcc or
[00:41:48 - 00:41:50] another institution because we offer
[00:41:50 - 00:41:52] a lot of short-term certificates
[00:41:52 - 00:41:52] we actually look at a
[00:41:55 - 00:41:55] positive outcome rate which includes
[00:41:55 - 00:41:56] the students who have completed
[00:41:56 - 00:41:59] something within that first year
[00:42:02 - 00:42:02] um for retention we see
[00:42:02 - 00:42:06] an increase in um fall
[00:42:06 - 00:42:06] to spring as well as
[00:42:06 - 00:42:08] fall to fall our preliminary
[00:42:08 - 00:42:10] numbers we have another probably
[00:42:10 - 00:42:13] 20 000 registrations before the
[00:42:13 - 00:42:13] first day of classes but
[00:42:14 - 00:42:14] preliminarily we're also going to
[00:42:14 - 00:42:17] be up by a little
[00:42:17 - 00:42:17] bit um a couple percentage
[00:42:20 - 00:42:20] points from fall to fall
[00:42:20 - 00:42:22] um when we look at
[00:42:22 - 00:42:22] our positive outcome rates we
[00:42:25 - 00:42:25] again see an increase over
[00:42:25 - 00:42:28] the last few years um
[00:42:28 - 00:42:28] fall 2023 is our students
[00:42:28 - 00:42:31] who entered in fall 2023
[00:42:31 - 00:42:34] their outcomes are fall 2024
[00:42:37 - 00:42:37] um so that's the most
[00:42:37 - 00:42:38] recent complete um so that's
[00:42:38 - 00:42:39] the most recent complete data
[00:42:39 - 00:42:41] data our ipad's three-year completion
[00:42:42 - 00:42:43] rate for our firsttime full-time
[00:42:44 - 00:42:48] students will be up that
[00:42:48 - 00:42:48] last bar is in gradient
[00:42:51 - 00:42:51] because the um some of
[00:42:51 - 00:42:55] those completions will also happen
[00:42:55 - 00:42:55] in the summer of 2025
[00:42:57 - 00:42:58] and that is still ongoing
[00:42:59 - 00:42:59] our four-year achieving the dream
[00:42:59 - 00:43:02] rate which uses a bigger
[00:43:02 - 00:43:04] cohort ipz is just our
[00:43:04 - 00:43:04] first time full-time these are
[00:43:04 - 00:43:06] all of our entering um
[00:43:06 - 00:43:08] hcc students full-time and part-time
[00:43:08 - 00:43:11] first-time and transfer in and
[00:43:11 - 00:43:11] as of the beginning of
[00:43:13 - 00:43:13] this summer we're even with
[00:43:13 - 00:43:15] last year for our four-year
[00:43:15 - 00:43:17] completion rate which suggests that
[00:43:17 - 00:43:17] at the end of this
[00:43:17 - 00:43:21] summer we will once again
[00:43:21 - 00:43:21] show an increase we will
[00:43:21 - 00:43:22] once again show an increase
[00:43:23 - 00:43:26] um um our transfer rate
[00:43:26 - 00:43:29] um now our transfer rate
[00:43:29 - 00:43:33] is really interesting here remember
[00:43:33 - 00:43:33] that fall 2020 was the
[00:43:33 - 00:43:36] covid term we dropped from
[00:43:36 - 00:43:39] having an entering cohort of
[00:43:39 - 00:43:39] about 12 700 to an
[00:43:39 - 00:43:42] entering cohort of about 9
[00:43:42 - 00:43:44] 000 what happened in that
[00:43:44 - 00:43:44] cohort as you may remember
[00:43:44 - 00:43:46] that was when all of
[00:43:46 - 00:43:48] the four years closed so
[00:43:48 - 00:43:48] a lot of students who
[00:43:48 - 00:43:50] normally weren't too sure they
[00:43:50 - 00:43:53] weren't going to go go
[00:43:53 - 00:43:53] to college didn't and the
[00:43:53 - 00:43:54] other thing that happened is
[00:43:54 - 00:43:57] we got students in who
[00:43:57 - 00:43:57] normally would have started at
[00:43:57 - 00:43:59] a 4-year but bulked at
[00:43:59 - 00:44:02] paying four-year prices to be
[00:44:02 - 00:44:02] remote in their high school
[00:44:06 - 00:44:06] bedroom i mean high school
[00:44:06 - 00:44:10] home so we think that
[00:44:10 - 00:44:10] the um fall 2020 rate
[00:44:10 - 00:44:13] it um was all the
[00:44:13 - 00:44:13] way to 34 reflecting some
[00:44:15 - 00:44:15] of that difference what's really
[00:44:16 - 00:44:16] heartening is that even though
[00:44:16 - 00:44:19] this summer 2025 transfers aren't
[00:44:19 - 00:44:23] in yet we see an
[00:44:23 - 00:44:23] increase over the fall 2019
[00:44:23 - 00:44:25] data so we still see
[00:44:25 - 00:44:29] that increasing pattern overall over
[00:44:29 - 00:44:32] the years um and um
[00:44:32 - 00:44:32] this is our transfer rate
[00:44:32 - 00:44:34] um by time of transfer
[00:44:34 - 00:44:37] students do transfer after that
[00:44:37 - 00:44:40] fourth year but we end
[00:44:40 - 00:44:40] the um we end the
[00:44:40 - 00:44:44] transfer rate calculation at four
[00:44:44 - 00:44:46] years with that um i
[00:44:46 - 00:44:46] will bring dr perez to
[00:44:53 - 00:44:53] thank you dr bullrin uh
[00:44:53 - 00:44:56] this part of the presentation
[00:44:56 - 00:44:56] is just a recap of
[00:44:56 - 00:44:58] the strategies and initiatives that
[00:44:58 - 00:45:00] we have implemented to ensure
[00:45:00 - 00:45:01] that we have that we
[00:45:01 - 00:45:04] achieve the intended performance outcomes
[00:45:04 - 00:45:07] discussed in this presentation uh
[00:45:07 - 00:45:07] as you seen before we
[00:45:07 - 00:45:09] do use the uh student
[00:45:09 - 00:45:11] success framework that focuses on
[00:45:11 - 00:45:11] connection which is getting the
[00:45:14 - 00:45:14] students enrolled uh entry to
[00:45:14 - 00:45:16] entry getting them on the
[00:45:16 - 00:45:18] right path to progress and
[00:45:18 - 00:45:20] completion which is providing the
[00:45:20 - 00:45:23] necessary support to ensure success
[00:45:23 - 00:45:25] through advancement which is job
[00:45:25 - 00:45:28] placement or transfer the quality
[00:45:28 - 00:45:28] enhancement plan which is our
[00:45:32 - 00:45:32] qep strategies and outcomes support
[00:45:32 - 00:45:35] the student experiences stages uh
[00:45:35 - 00:45:37] included in the student success
[00:45:37 - 00:45:39] framework and you'll see that
[00:45:39 - 00:45:39] that's how we set the
[00:45:39 - 00:45:42] uh qep set up you
[00:45:42 - 00:45:42] also heard about the uh
[00:45:44 - 00:45:44] three uh general major general
[00:45:46 - 00:45:46] strategies the caring campus for
[00:45:46 - 00:45:49] faculty and staff uh the
[00:45:49 - 00:45:52] talent strong uh texas pathways
[00:45:52 - 00:45:52] uh hcc will participate again
[00:45:55 - 00:45:55] this year uh and this
[00:45:55 - 00:45:57] our focus for this year
[00:45:57 - 00:45:57] will be on transfer what
[00:45:57 - 00:45:59] is it that we can
[00:45:59 - 00:45:59] do to enhance transfer of
[00:46:01 - 00:46:01] our students and then of
[00:46:01 - 00:46:04] course we continue to do
[00:46:04 - 00:46:06] proactive advising uh one of
[00:46:06 - 00:46:06] the things that we've uh
[00:46:06 - 00:46:09] added of course for for
[00:46:09 - 00:46:10] the uh academic advising has
[00:46:10 - 00:46:13] been the virtual support services
[00:46:13 - 00:46:13] which is made available to
[00:46:15 - 00:46:15] students from all of the
[00:46:15 - 00:46:17] seven colleges where they can
[00:46:17 - 00:46:20] receive information regarding um admissions
[00:46:20 - 00:46:22] enrollment advising and other support
[00:46:22 - 00:46:24] services without having to go
[00:46:24 - 00:46:26] to a campus uh they
[00:46:26 - 00:46:26] are they are able to
[00:46:26 - 00:46:29] receive real-time support from our
[00:46:29 - 00:46:31] staff in person or virtually
[00:46:31 - 00:46:33] uh the other thing that
[00:46:33 - 00:46:33] we created was that web
[00:46:33 - 00:46:35] page which you've seen before
[00:46:35 - 00:46:37] where information on college payment
[00:46:37 - 00:46:39] options have all been consolidated
[00:46:39 - 00:46:40] into this one page making
[00:46:41 - 00:46:41] it easier for students to
[00:46:41 - 00:46:43] understand what are their payment
[00:46:43 - 00:46:46] options that are available to
[00:46:46 - 00:46:46] them uh there's been more
[00:46:47 - 00:46:47] focus uh and of course
[00:46:47 - 00:46:49] these are the types of
[00:46:49 - 00:46:49] financial aid that we have
[00:46:49 - 00:46:51] as well there's also been
[00:46:51 - 00:46:53] more focus on addressing retention
[00:46:53 - 00:46:55] by ensuring that all students
[00:46:55 - 00:46:57] have an assigned advisor this
[00:46:57 - 00:46:58] includes the advising touch points
[00:47:02 - 00:47:02] on uh on slide um
[00:47:02 - 00:47:02] 20 the goal is to
[00:47:03 - 00:47:03] ensure that students are advised
[00:47:04 - 00:47:05] at designated touch points during
[00:47:05 - 00:47:08] their journey at hcc your
[00:47:08 - 00:47:11] approval of the advising platform
[00:47:11 - 00:47:13] will assist in tracking our
[00:47:13 - 00:47:15] students from entry to completion
[00:47:15 - 00:47:18] the advising platform will provide
[00:47:18 - 00:47:18] up-to-date and accurate data on
[00:47:20 - 00:47:20] tracking our progress with the
[00:47:22 - 00:47:22] advisement of our students as
[00:47:22 - 00:47:26] well as where they are
[00:47:26 - 00:47:28] in their chosen pathway lastly
[00:47:28 - 00:47:28] there is these are the
[00:47:28 - 00:47:30] hours or these are our
[00:47:30 - 00:47:31] touch point of where number
[00:47:31 - 00:47:31] of hours that students have
[00:47:33 - 00:47:33] accumulated that we have to
[00:47:33 - 00:47:35] ensure that they have in
[00:47:35 - 00:47:38] fact consulted with an advisor
[00:47:38 - 00:47:38] and then lastly there is
[00:47:39 - 00:47:39] extensive ongoing training of the
[00:47:41 - 00:47:41] student services staff as well
[00:47:41 - 00:47:44] as the faculty uh special
[00:47:44 - 00:47:47] focus has been on behaviors
[00:47:47 - 00:47:47] that show our students at
[00:47:47 - 00:47:50] hcc cares both outside the
[00:47:50 - 00:47:52] classroom as well as inside
[00:47:52 - 00:47:54] the classroom this concludes the
[00:47:54 - 00:47:56] presentation thank you thank you
[00:47:56 - 00:47:58] thank you chancellor thank you
[00:47:58 - 00:47:58] uh dr pettis dr burgess
[00:47:58 - 00:48:01] any any questions trusty sheban
[00:48:03 - 00:48:03] yeah i think i've i've
[00:48:03 - 00:48:04] got one request and then
[00:48:04 - 00:48:04] i wanted to talk about
[00:48:04 - 00:48:07] the transfer data a little
[00:48:07 - 00:48:09] bit um request is um
[00:48:09 - 00:48:09] and the transfer data illustrates
[00:48:11 - 00:48:11] this really well every time
[00:48:11 - 00:48:12] we talk about data like
[00:48:12 - 00:48:12] this and i know it's
[00:48:12 - 00:48:15] not fun to put big
[00:48:15 - 00:48:16] data tables in board presentations
[00:48:16 - 00:48:16] but it would be really
[00:48:18 - 00:48:18] helpful to have the full
[00:48:18 - 00:48:20] benchmarking data set so that
[00:48:20 - 00:48:22] we can understand better the
[00:48:22 - 00:48:23] context of these numbers can
[00:48:23 - 00:48:23] you repeat that trusty sh
[00:48:24 - 00:48:24] it would be very helpful
[00:48:24 - 00:48:26] to have the full benchmarking
[00:48:26 - 00:48:28] data set that's available to
[00:48:28 - 00:48:28] us that's part of the
[00:48:28 - 00:48:31] that goes along with these
[00:48:31 - 00:48:33] numbers um and and that
[00:48:33 - 00:48:33] that transfer data i think
[00:48:33 - 00:48:37] is is a great example
[00:48:37 - 00:48:37] that if if that 34
[00:48:38 - 00:48:38] jump which you all remember
[00:48:38 - 00:48:40] i was incredibly am and
[00:48:40 - 00:48:42] and still am incredibly excited
[00:48:42 - 00:48:43] about is that that goes
[00:48:43 - 00:48:43] from middle of the pack
[00:48:43 - 00:48:45] to leading the pack in
[00:48:45 - 00:48:48] terms of performance if that
[00:48:48 - 00:48:48] was the result of a
[00:48:48 - 00:48:50] macro environment that our competitors
[00:48:50 - 00:48:53] also experienced and it 34
[00:48:53 - 00:48:55] was now the middle of
[00:48:55 - 00:48:55] the pack that should have
[00:48:57 - 00:48:57] elicited a very different reaction
[00:48:57 - 00:49:00] from us as an institution
[00:49:00 - 00:49:01] versus just the absolute number
[00:49:01 - 00:49:03] improvement so it's still amazing
[00:49:03 - 00:49:03] but it would have elicited
[00:49:04 - 00:49:04] a very different set of
[00:49:04 - 00:49:07] actions afterwards if that benchmarking
[00:49:07 - 00:49:10] data you know if it
[00:49:10 - 00:49:10] was available um if we
[00:49:10 - 00:49:12] had it in that context
[00:49:12 - 00:49:12] and it could have had
[00:49:12 - 00:49:14] a a a more holistic
[00:49:14 - 00:49:16] discussion around it so i'll
[00:49:16 - 00:49:16] just pause and let you
[00:49:16 - 00:49:18] respond to that yeah we
[00:49:18 - 00:49:18] would we're very happy to
[00:49:21 - 00:49:21] provide the benchmarking data um
[00:49:21 - 00:49:23] one note though is that
[00:49:23 - 00:49:25] the benchmarking data typically lags
[00:49:25 - 00:49:25] a year to two years
[00:49:29 - 00:49:29] be be um behind what
[00:49:29 - 00:49:32] we present here so we're
[00:49:32 - 00:49:32] just starting to get in
[00:49:32 - 00:49:34] that first transfer data those
[00:49:34 - 00:49:37] first transfer data points and
[00:49:37 - 00:49:40] and um we'll probably have
[00:49:40 - 00:49:40] them knock on wood um
[00:49:45 - 00:49:45] late later this academic year
[00:49:45 - 00:49:48] um so we we don't
[00:49:48 - 00:49:48] have an update to the
[00:49:48 - 00:49:50] prior benchmarking data we've given
[00:49:50 - 00:49:52] to you at this time
[00:49:52 - 00:49:52] but we we'll definitely keep
[00:49:54 - 00:49:54] that in mind and provide
[00:49:54 - 00:49:56] what we have with these
[00:49:56 - 00:49:58] reports in the future okay
[00:49:58 - 00:49:58] thank you for that um
[00:49:58 - 00:50:00] i think that the second
[00:50:00 - 00:50:00] item i wanted to dig
[00:50:02 - 00:50:02] into and and i know
[00:50:02 - 00:50:03] dr perez you did talk
[00:50:03 - 00:50:03] a bit about the interventions
[00:50:04 - 00:50:05] that are planned to focus
[00:50:05 - 00:50:09] on that transfer rate um
[00:50:09 - 00:50:09] but i think for for
[00:50:09 - 00:50:12] folks that are looking at
[00:50:12 - 00:50:12] the data this data was
[00:50:14 - 00:50:14] very likely eye openening to
[00:50:14 - 00:50:16] folks that you know this
[00:50:16 - 00:50:16] is a big you know
[00:50:19 - 00:50:19] upward change in performance and
[00:50:19 - 00:50:21] a very key metric for
[00:50:21 - 00:50:21] hcc and i think my
[00:50:21 - 00:50:23] my fear here would be
[00:50:23 - 00:50:23] is that if you see
[00:50:24 - 00:50:27] a big upward um change
[00:50:27 - 00:50:27] in the data and then
[00:50:27 - 00:50:29] a big downward people say
[00:50:29 - 00:50:31] ah flash in the pan
[00:50:31 - 00:50:31] and then they go on
[00:50:31 - 00:50:33] to looking at other institutions
[00:50:33 - 00:50:34] if they were you know
[00:50:34 - 00:50:34] looking at it from a
[00:50:34 - 00:50:36] philanthropic standpoint or a uh
[00:50:36 - 00:50:38] or partnership standpoint um so
[00:50:38 - 00:50:40] just really wanted to key
[00:50:40 - 00:50:40] in here like how how
[00:50:40 - 00:50:42] critical it is for us
[00:50:42 - 00:50:42] to to focus on that
[00:50:42 - 00:50:43] so understanding there's going to
[00:50:43 - 00:50:44] be a bit of a
[00:50:44 - 00:50:44] dip because of the macro
[00:50:47 - 00:50:47] environment but focusing in on
[00:50:47 - 00:50:49] how we can minimize and
[00:50:49 - 00:50:52] mitigate and then use that
[00:50:52 - 00:50:52] as a strength to show
[00:50:52 - 00:50:54] that this is a you
[00:50:54 - 00:50:54] know one point in a
[00:50:54 - 00:50:56] trend in really exemplary performance
[00:50:56 - 00:50:59] versus just one blip from
[00:50:59 - 00:50:59] a a covid environment and
[00:51:01 - 00:51:01] it kind of goes back
[00:51:01 - 00:51:03] to the normal trend line
[00:51:03 - 00:51:03] so um wanted to to
[00:51:03 - 00:51:05] give another opportunity again to
[00:51:05 - 00:51:06] to you know how can
[00:51:07 - 00:51:07] we really hunker down and
[00:51:07 - 00:51:09] and make sure that students
[00:51:09 - 00:51:09] are supported and that our
[00:51:11 - 00:51:11] staff and faculty are supported
[00:51:11 - 00:51:13] to ensure that that any
[00:51:13 - 00:51:16] kind of dip from 34
[00:51:16 - 00:51:18] that's the temporary phenomenon versus
[00:51:18 - 00:51:18] the 30 34 itself being
[00:51:18 - 00:51:23] the i think one of
[00:51:23 - 00:51:25] the things that we already
[00:51:25 - 00:51:25] have decided that we we
[00:51:25 - 00:51:29] need to really um really
[00:51:29 - 00:51:31] uh integrate into the advising
[00:51:31 - 00:51:31] initially when students come in
[00:51:33 - 00:51:33] is to talk about transfer
[00:51:33 - 00:51:35] we have a tendency not
[00:51:35 - 00:51:35] to talk to them about
[00:51:35 - 00:51:37] it until later on in
[00:51:37 - 00:51:39] their program we need to
[00:51:39 - 00:51:39] start that from the very
[00:51:39 - 00:51:41] beginning to to get them
[00:51:41 - 00:51:41] to start thinking about what
[00:51:43 - 00:51:43] school you're considering and helping
[00:51:43 - 00:51:45] to start making some decisions
[00:51:45 - 00:51:47] about what where they want
[00:51:47 - 00:51:47] to go and why they
[00:51:47 - 00:51:49] want to go there in
[00:51:49 - 00:51:49] terms of the area uh
[00:51:49 - 00:51:52] of of major they wish
[00:51:52 - 00:51:53] to pursue so so that's
[00:51:53 - 00:51:53] what we're doing with the
[00:51:53 - 00:51:55] with this uh with this
[00:51:55 - 00:51:57] new initiative under the texas
[00:51:57 - 00:51:57] pathway is setting up those
[00:51:59 - 00:51:59] processes so that we can
[00:51:59 - 00:52:01] ensure that these students know
[00:52:01 - 00:52:03] ahead of time and that
[00:52:03 - 00:52:03] we know how to better
[00:52:03 - 00:52:05] advise them as they continue
[00:52:05 - 00:52:06] through their journey at hcc
[00:52:08 - 00:52:08] i i appreciate that and
[00:52:08 - 00:52:10] one one final reflection for
[00:52:10 - 00:52:10] me is very excited to
[00:52:10 - 00:52:12] see how the new advising
[00:52:12 - 00:52:14] platform plays into this appreciate
[00:52:14 - 00:52:14] you calling that out as
[00:52:16 - 00:52:16] a as a big win
[00:52:16 - 00:52:17] for the institution i think
[00:52:17 - 00:52:17] it would be helpful that
[00:52:17 - 00:52:19] as you start to generate
[00:52:19 - 00:52:21] proof points on how effective
[00:52:21 - 00:52:23] that software platform has been
[00:52:23 - 00:52:23] in driving you know student
[00:52:25 - 00:52:25] outcomes and these numbers be
[00:52:25 - 00:52:26] good to share that back
[00:52:26 - 00:52:26] with us just so that
[00:52:26 - 00:52:28] we we can see the
[00:52:28 - 00:52:29] impact of our it investments
[00:52:29 - 00:52:30] at work we definitely will
[00:52:33 - 00:52:34] thank you thank you thank
[00:52:34 - 00:52:39] you thank you thank you

[00:59:38 - 00:59:38] as the chancellor indicated this
[00:59:40 - 00:59:40] is a standard uh quarterly
[00:59:40 - 00:59:43] report that we do on
[00:59:43 - 00:59:43] the status of the audit
[00:59:43 - 00:59:46] plan so the audit plan
[00:59:46 - 00:59:46] is uh for fiscal year
[00:59:46 - 00:59:47] so the audit plan is
[00:59:47 - 00:59:48] uh for fiscal year 2025
[00:59:48 - 00:59:52] 2025 so the presentation will
[00:59:52 - 00:59:57] summarize internal audit uh status
[00:59:57 - 01:00:00] information uh we'll talk about
[01:00:00 - 01:00:03] follow-up observations on on previous
[01:00:03 - 01:00:06] reports external audit reviews uh
[01:00:06 - 01:00:06] that have been done on
[01:00:06 - 01:00:09] acc in this time period
[01:00:09 - 01:00:12] and we'll basically give our
[01:00:12 - 01:00:13] statement of independence and and
[01:00:14 - 01:00:17] and non-impairments u and and
[01:00:17 - 01:00:18] no scope non-impairments u and
[01:00:19 - 01:00:24] and no scope limitations so
[01:00:24 - 01:00:24] we have three audit projects
[01:00:24 - 01:00:27] that are in the finalization
[01:00:27 - 01:00:30] stage right now uh it

[01:01:31 - 01:01:33] follow-up status report it indicates
[01:01:33 - 01:01:37] all the observations that we
[01:01:37 - 01:01:41] have still uh we're still
[01:01:41 - 01:01:41] tracking uh it'll indicate status
[01:01:44 - 01:01:44] of whether they've been completed
[01:01:44 - 01:01:46] or if uh they're still
[01:01:46 - 01:01:49] in progress in an estimated
[01:01:49 - 01:01:51] completion date um mcconnell's and
[01:01:51 - 01:01:53] jones report as that audit
[01:01:53 - 01:01:53] happened about three years ago
[01:01:56 - 01:01:56] they had 19 recommendations on
[01:01:56 - 01:01:57] grant they had 19 recommendations
[01:01:57 - 01:02:02] on grant processing processing uh
[01:02:02 - 01:02:02] we have finally completed the
[01:02:02 - 01:02:07] last recommendation which was to
[01:02:07 - 01:02:10] automate our um grants processing
[01:02:14 - 01:02:14] uh process and i understand
[01:02:14 - 01:02:19] we went live on that
[01:02:19 - 01:02:19] uh in june so that
[01:02:19 - 01:02:22] that automation process is as
[01:02:22 - 01:02:24] i understand it is for
[01:02:24 - 01:02:24] state and federal grants and
[01:02:31 - 01:02:33] all right so uh i
[01:02:33 - 01:02:33] guess after i finish all
[01:02:34 - 01:02:37] my presentations today forest majour
[01:02:37 - 01:02:40] will give their audit plan
[01:02:40 - 01:02:43] for uh the financial statements
[01:02:43 - 01:02:47] audit uh for this fiscal
[01:02:47 - 01:02:47] year um and so we
[01:02:47 - 01:02:50] had a regulatory imposed uh
[01:02:50 - 01:02:53] review it was a compliance
[01:02:53 - 01:02:53] monitoring desk review of our
[01:02:56 - 01:02:56] texas ed educational opportunity grant
[01:02:59 - 01:02:59] and they had no observations
[01:03:02 - 01:03:07] uh in their report um
[01:03:07 - 01:03:07] and as i say uh
[01:03:07 - 01:03:09] basically we're going to be
[01:03:09 - 01:03:11] given the statement every time
[01:03:11 - 01:03:11] that uh our internal audit
[01:03:13 - 01:03:13] function has experienced no independence
[01:03:18 - 01:03:18] impairments and andor scope limitations
[01:03:21 - 01:03:21] so everybody at acc has
[01:03:21 - 01:03:21] been very so everybody at
[01:03:21 - 01:03:22] acc has been very cooperative
[01:03:22 - 01:03:28] cooperative with uh helping us
[01:03:28 - 01:03:31] execute our audits and that's
[01:03:31 - 01:03:31] my status report uh i'll

[01:04:26 - 01:04:31] development considerations the project types
[01:04:31 - 01:04:31] and uh the planned projects
[01:04:31 - 01:04:32] types and uh the planned
[01:04:33 - 01:04:35] projects so so we give
[01:04:35 - 01:04:38] into consideration these 10 items
[01:04:38 - 01:04:38] uh that i have listed
[01:04:38 - 01:04:39] here in our items uh
[01:04:39 - 01:04:40] that i have listed here
[01:04:40 - 01:04:40] in our presentation presentation presentation
[01:04:43 - 01:04:46] uh uh all the executive
[01:04:46 - 01:04:50] management of hcc uh were
[01:04:50 - 01:04:50] interviewed uh 24 interviews by
[01:04:50 - 01:04:52] uh were interviewed uh 24
[01:04:52 - 01:04:56] interviews by uh uh mr
[01:04:56 - 01:04:56] uh robert mccracken and myself
[01:04:56 - 01:04:58] in doing an enterprise risk
[01:04:58 - 01:05:02] assessment for the year uh
[01:05:02 - 01:05:02] basically our our tool that
[01:05:07 - 01:05:07] we use to analyze risk
[01:05:07 - 01:05:09] has 239 risk in it
[01:05:09 - 01:05:09] and then we try to
[01:05:09 - 01:05:12] narrow it down to the
[01:05:12 - 01:05:12] top risks that we consider
[01:05:12 - 01:05:14] and that's what we try
[01:05:14 - 01:05:17] to focus on in developing
[01:05:17 - 01:05:17] our audit plan uh so
[01:05:17 - 01:05:20] we we consider all these
[01:05:20 - 01:05:23] things uh whatever use of
[01:05:23 - 01:05:25] external consultants we use external
[01:05:25 - 01:05:25] audits uh and then we
[01:05:26 - 01:05:29] have organizations that do top
[01:05:29 - 01:05:32] 10 educational risk that we
[01:05:32 - 01:05:32] can look at and then
[01:05:32 - 01:05:36] we want to comply with
[01:05:36 - 01:05:38] the um institute of internal
[01:05:38 - 01:05:40] auditors international professional practice framework
[01:05:40 - 01:05:43] we also take into consideration
[01:05:43 - 01:05:46] what the texas internal auditing
[01:05:46 - 01:05:46] act requires us to do
[01:05:49 - 01:05:49] an internal audit and then
[01:05:49 - 01:05:53] uh we try to align
[01:05:53 - 01:05:53] our uh plan with acc
[01:05:53 - 01:05:54] strategic align our uh plan
[01:05:54 - 01:05:55] with acc strategic priorities priorities
[01:05:58 - 01:05:58] and so the the the
[01:05:58 - 01:06:01] plan uh is attached in
[01:06:01 - 01:06:01] your package that uh we're
[01:06:01 - 01:06:07] asking you to approve so
[01:06:07 - 01:06:07] the project types i have
[01:06:07 - 01:06:10] broken out this year uh
[01:06:10 - 01:06:10] i used to put the
[01:06:13 - 01:06:13] information technology audits under information
[01:06:14 - 01:06:15] technology audits under operational operational
[01:06:17 - 01:06:17] but now i've broken it
[01:06:17 - 01:06:19] out so now we have
[01:06:19 - 01:06:22] operational we have compliance audits
[01:06:22 - 01:06:24] information technology advisory services administrative
[01:06:24 - 01:06:26] work we need to do
[01:06:26 - 01:06:29] and then observation follow-up that
[01:06:29 - 01:06:29] we need to do um
[01:06:29 - 01:06:32] a lot of times the
[01:06:32 - 01:06:34] operational compliance and information technology
[01:06:37 - 01:06:37] are end up being hybrid
[01:06:37 - 01:06:44] audits that we so under
[01:06:44 - 01:06:47] operational so under operational um
[01:06:49 - 01:06:49] i mean you you can't
[01:06:49 - 01:06:52] be an internal auditor in
[01:06:52 - 01:06:55] our uh internal audit department
[01:06:55 - 01:06:55] if you can't handle uh
[01:06:55 - 01:06:57] doing a brand new audit
[01:06:57 - 01:07:00] from scratch and in this
[01:07:00 - 01:07:00] year's plan we have some
[01:07:00 - 01:07:03] of those that can make
[01:07:03 - 01:07:06] uh some internal auditors very
[01:07:06 - 01:07:06] nervous uh so we're going
[01:07:06 - 01:07:09] to try and look at
[01:07:09 - 01:07:09] our our minors on campus
[01:07:09 - 01:07:13] and how we manage that
[01:07:13 - 01:07:17] uh we're going to look
[01:07:17 - 01:07:17] at policing uh we're going
[01:07:17 - 01:07:20] to the plan has quite
[01:07:20 - 01:07:20] a few things uh that
[01:07:22 - 01:07:22] we're going to look at
[01:07:22 - 01:07:24] in policing uh which we
[01:07:24 - 01:07:28] haven't looked that much into
[01:07:28 - 01:07:28] in the past but uh
[01:07:28 - 01:07:29] in policing they they're going
[01:07:29 - 01:07:29] to be doing a lot
[01:07:29 - 01:07:32] of upgrade of systems and
[01:07:32 - 01:07:35] automation and and uh new
[01:07:35 - 01:07:40] equipment um cameras and other
[01:07:40 - 01:07:43] things um so uh we're
[01:07:43 - 01:07:43] going to take a look
[01:07:43 - 01:07:46] at that uh in compliance
[01:07:46 - 01:07:46] this is fairly normal we
[01:07:50 - 01:07:50] do three colleges each year
[01:07:50 - 01:07:53] where we look at the
[01:07:53 - 01:07:57] safety and environmental uh compliance
[01:07:57 - 01:07:57] uh mainly in the labs
[01:07:57 - 01:07:57] and and compliance uh mainly
[01:07:58 - 01:07:58] in the labs and and
[01:07:58 - 01:08:01] um um osha requirements and
[01:08:01 - 01:08:04] fire protection things like that
[01:08:04 - 01:08:04] and then uh we want
[01:08:04 - 01:08:06] to take a look here
[01:08:06 - 01:08:08] again this would be with
[01:08:08 - 01:08:08] the police department we want
[01:08:08 - 01:08:11] to look at uh our
[01:08:11 - 01:08:19] compliance with clearary so information
[01:08:19 - 01:08:21] technology uh going to look
[01:08:21 - 01:08:21] at we're we're pretty much
[01:08:21 - 01:08:24] looking at it disaster recovery
[01:08:24 - 01:08:27] every year now and and
[01:08:27 - 01:08:30] business continuity uh there's a
[01:08:30 - 01:08:30] lot of topics under that
[01:08:30 - 01:08:35] uh one thing that we're
[01:08:35 - 01:08:35] doing now is uh tac
[01:08:35 - 01:08:38] 202 that's a regulation uh
[01:08:38 - 01:08:41] texas regulation that requires our
[01:08:41 - 01:08:45] it department to do audits
[01:08:45 - 01:08:45] basically on their data security
[01:08:51 - 01:08:51] and cyber security and it
[01:08:51 - 01:08:53] has uh special things that
[01:08:53 - 01:08:53] you're supposed to do and
[01:08:55 - 01:08:55] and so we're going to
[01:08:55 - 01:08:58] help them with that which
[01:08:58 - 01:08:58] we've been doing in the
[01:08:58 - 01:09:01] past but now we're going
[01:09:01 - 01:09:05] to make a uh conscientious
[01:09:05 - 01:09:05] effort to document that we
[01:09:09 - 01:09:09] are reviewing tac 202 things
[01:09:09 - 01:09:12] and over a two-year period
[01:09:12 - 01:09:12] we intend to cover all
[01:09:16 - 01:09:16] tac 202 requirements and so
[01:09:16 - 01:09:18] and then we're also going
[01:09:18 - 01:09:18] to look at uh it
[01:09:25 - 01:09:27] uh under advisory services probably
[01:09:27 - 01:09:27] um some of the things
[01:09:27 - 01:09:30] you're more interested in is
[01:09:30 - 01:09:33] uh we're going to go
[01:09:33 - 01:09:33] ahead and look at our
[01:09:33 - 01:09:36] fiscal year 2025 spending on
[01:09:36 - 01:09:39] contracted services we'll do an
[01:09:39 - 01:09:42] analysis on that that's makes
[01:09:42 - 01:09:42] up typically about 8 of
[01:09:42 - 01:09:45] hcc's expenditures for the year
[01:09:45 - 01:09:48] uh it's second to payroll
[01:09:48 - 01:09:48] in category of second to
[01:09:49 - 01:09:50] payroll in category of expense
[01:09:50 - 01:09:52] expense uh and then we
[01:09:52 - 01:09:52] want to look at uh
[01:09:52 - 01:09:58] less than 100 000 payments
[01:09:58 - 01:09:58] uh as you know uh
[01:09:58 - 01:10:02] payments under 100 000 need
[01:10:02 - 01:10:05] no board approval and so
[01:10:05 - 01:10:05] it'll give you an idea
[01:10:05 - 01:10:09] of what we're spending under
[01:10:09 - 01:10:12] 100 000 uh we we
[01:10:12 - 01:10:12] going to try and help
[01:10:12 - 01:10:16] with procurement efficiency and look
[01:10:16 - 01:10:19] at that and then we
[01:10:19 - 01:10:19] this would be involving the
[01:10:22 - 01:10:22] police department again under hb33
[01:10:25 - 01:10:25] uh that's a new regulation
[01:10:25 - 01:10:27] that's going to go into
[01:10:27 - 01:10:28] effect on active shooter and
[01:10:30 - 01:10:30] campus security that we're going
[01:10:30 - 01:10:32] to be required to comply
[01:10:32 - 01:10:32] with so we want to
[01:10:34 - 01:10:34] look at our preparedness for
[01:10:34 - 01:10:37] that we want to continue
[01:10:37 - 01:10:37] monitoring web website want to
[01:10:38 - 01:10:39] continue monitoring web website accessibility
[01:10:39 - 01:10:42] accessibility and then there's uh
[01:10:42 - 01:10:45] senate bill 37 faculty senate
[01:10:45 - 01:10:46] restruct reconstruction so we want
[01:10:46 - 01:10:46] to make sure we put
[01:10:46 - 01:10:55] that administrative uh the main
[01:10:55 - 01:10:58] thing there uh these new
[01:10:58 - 01:11:00] standards well the standards have
[01:11:00 - 01:11:00] always required us to do
[01:11:04 - 01:11:04] a quality assurance assessment so
[01:11:04 - 01:11:07] uh but uh we're going
[01:11:07 - 01:11:08] to make sure we're when
[01:11:08 - 01:11:08] we do our internal quality
[01:11:10 - 01:11:10] assurance assessment on our department
[01:11:11 - 01:11:11] we're going to make sure
[01:11:11 - 01:11:13] we're in compliance with the
[01:11:13 - 01:11:16] new global standards that we've
[01:11:16 - 01:11:16] been putting in and so
[01:11:16 - 01:11:19] we'll spend some time making
[01:11:19 - 01:11:21] sure that we have the
[01:11:21 - 01:11:21] new global uh internal audit
[01:11:24 - 01:11:24] standards uh completely transitioned to
[01:11:28 - 01:11:28] and then we'll uh as
[01:11:28 - 01:11:31] always we'll follow up on
[01:11:31 - 01:11:31] observations as anybody who has
[01:11:34 - 01:11:34] experienced an internal audit knows
[01:11:34 - 01:11:39] we do not drop an
[01:11:39 - 01:11:39] observation in the uh the
[01:11:43 - 01:11:43] action plan to to resolve
[01:11:43 - 01:11:45] any observation we have until
[01:11:45 - 01:11:47] it's been completed so it
[01:11:47 - 01:11:50] gets tracked until completed and
[01:11:50 - 01:11:50] so that's uh the other
[01:11:53 - 01:11:55] thing we'll look into so
[01:11:55 - 01:11:55] with that uh we recommend
[01:11:55 - 01:11:58] that the board of trustees
[01:11:58 - 01:12:03] approve the proposed uh fiscal
[01:12:03 - 01:12:03] year 2026 internal audit plan

[01:13:08 - 01:13:08] and answer all questions mr
[01:13:08 - 01:13:13] corgan corgan thank you chancellor
[01:13:13 - 01:13:15] so as you're probably aware
[01:13:15 - 01:13:17] i've been talking about it
[01:13:20 - 01:13:20] all last year uh we
[01:13:20 - 01:13:22] have the new global internal
[01:13:22 - 01:13:22] audit standards that that came
[01:13:25 - 01:13:25] out and went into effect
[01:13:25 - 01:13:27] in in january of 2025
[01:13:29 - 01:13:29] uh under the new standards
[01:13:29 - 01:13:32] it makes it mandatory that
[01:13:32 - 01:13:35] uh an internal audit department
[01:13:35 - 01:13:35] have a strategic plan and
[01:13:35 - 01:13:37] it makes it mandatory that
[01:13:37 - 01:13:42] the internal audit department uh
[01:13:42 - 01:13:42] discuss that plan and review
[01:13:42 - 01:13:46] that plan with the uh
[01:13:46 - 01:13:49] audit committee and with management
[01:13:49 - 01:13:49] and uh the main things
[01:13:52 - 01:13:52] that are required to be
[01:13:52 - 01:13:56] in that plan is what
[01:13:56 - 01:13:56] what the vision of the
[01:13:56 - 01:13:58] uh internal audit department is
[01:13:58 - 01:14:01] the strategic objectives of the
[01:14:01 - 01:14:03] department and the supporting initiatives
[01:14:06 - 01:14:06] uh to help achieve those
[01:14:06 - 01:14:08] objectives uh and so the
[01:14:08 - 01:14:11] chief audit executive must review
[01:14:11 - 01:14:11] the internal strategy with the
[01:14:13 - 01:14:15] board and senior management periodically
[01:14:15 - 01:14:15] and so it's like a
[01:14:15 - 01:14:17] it's a living document that
[01:14:17 - 01:14:18] can change over living document
[01:14:18 - 01:14:20] that can change over time
[01:14:20 - 01:14:22] time so what's included in
[01:14:22 - 01:14:25] the strategic plan and i
[01:14:25 - 01:14:25] hope you had an an
[01:14:25 - 01:14:27] opportunity to read through it
[01:14:27 - 01:14:27] uh so we have an
[01:14:30 - 01:14:30] introduction of what a strategic
[01:14:30 - 01:14:35] plan's all about um we
[01:14:35 - 01:14:35] have a link to internal

[01:14:58 - 01:15:00] talks about alignment with hcc's
[01:15:00 - 01:15:03] institutional tenure priorities we try

[01:17:41 - 01:17:44] first off say thank you
[01:17:44 - 01:17:44] um for letting us continue
[01:17:44 - 01:17:47] this audit um it is
[01:17:47 - 01:17:47] a i think a three
[01:17:47 - 01:17:49] or five fiveyear contract so
[01:17:49 - 01:17:53] this is uh year two
[01:17:53 - 01:17:53] of the contract um and
[01:17:53 - 01:17:55] so um we did a
[01:17:55 - 01:17:55] lot of this last year
[01:17:55 - 01:17:58] so it might look familiar
[01:17:58 - 01:18:00] um but we did just
[01:18:00 - 01:18:00] want to put our faces
[01:18:00 - 01:18:02] out there for you so
[01:18:02 - 01:18:02] we have our engagement team
[01:18:04 - 01:18:04] here and uh most of
[01:18:04 - 01:18:06] this team was on the
[01:18:06 - 01:18:06] team last year which we're
[01:18:06 - 01:18:09] uh really excited about so
[01:18:09 - 01:18:11] we will be able to
[01:18:11 - 01:18:11] use the knowledge from last
[01:18:11 - 01:18:14] year and and continue this
[01:18:14 - 01:18:16] year um and so the
[01:18:16 - 01:18:16] fir the thing that we're
[01:18:16 - 01:18:17] really going to talk about
[01:18:17 - 01:18:20] today is really just our
[01:18:20 - 01:18:20] the scope of our audit
[01:18:20 - 01:18:25] um and that includes the
[01:18:25 - 01:18:25] audit of the actuer which
[01:18:27 - 01:18:27] is the annual comprehensive financial
[01:18:31 - 01:18:31] report of the college um
[01:18:31 - 01:18:33] it is that very large
[01:18:33 - 01:18:33] packet that you get in
[01:18:35 - 01:18:35] december um and there's a
[01:18:35 - 01:18:38] lot of information in there
[01:18:38 - 01:18:41] we will audit most of
[01:18:41 - 01:18:41] that information um there are
[01:18:41 - 01:18:43] a few schedules in there
[01:18:43 - 01:18:45] that uh we consider not
[01:18:45 - 01:18:45] audited um we do read
[01:18:45 - 01:18:47] them just to make sure
[01:18:47 - 01:18:47] that the information in there
[01:18:49 - 01:18:49] does not say anything that
[01:18:49 - 01:18:51] would contradict what is in
[01:18:51 - 01:18:54] the audited information we also
[01:18:54 - 01:18:56] do our single audit which
[01:18:56 - 01:18:56] is what we are doing
[01:18:56 - 01:18:58] right now um and so
[01:18:58 - 01:18:58] we do a federal single
[01:18:58 - 01:19:00] audit and that is in
[01:19:00 - 01:19:02] accordance with uniform guidance and
[01:19:02 - 01:19:02] then we also do a
[01:19:02 - 01:19:04] state single audit and that
[01:19:04 - 01:19:07] is in accordance with texas
[01:19:07 - 01:19:10] grant management standards um so
[01:19:10 - 01:19:10] this year we will be
[01:19:10 - 01:19:12] looking at the student financial
[01:19:12 - 01:19:14] aid cluster for federal um
[01:19:14 - 01:19:14] and this is as of
[01:19:14 - 01:19:17] right now if unless something
[01:19:17 - 01:19:19] changes i guess through the
[01:19:19 - 01:19:19] end of the month um
[01:19:19 - 01:19:22] we could look at more
[01:19:22 - 01:19:22] but we'll be looking or
[01:19:22 - 01:19:25] are already looking at the
[01:19:25 - 01:19:28] sfa cluster and then we
[01:19:28 - 01:19:28] look at the teog program
[01:19:28 - 01:19:31] um for the state side
[01:19:31 - 01:19:33] uh which is also where
[01:19:33 - 01:19:33] most of y'all's state money
[01:19:33 - 01:19:36] comes from so it's a
[01:19:36 - 01:19:38] very large chunk um and
[01:19:38 - 01:19:38] so we do those in
[01:19:38 - 01:19:41] accordance with gas and gagis
[01:19:41 - 01:19:41] um as well as the
[01:19:43 - 01:19:43] uniform guidance and the texas
[01:19:43 - 01:19:45] grant management standards as i
[01:19:45 - 01:19:47] mentioned um i did mention
[01:19:47 - 01:19:48] that there's other information in
[01:19:48 - 01:19:53] those financial statements and we
[01:19:53 - 01:19:53] do not um do those
[01:19:53 - 01:19:53] you want to take that
[01:19:55 - 01:19:57] no no please okay um
[01:19:57 - 01:19:58] so our planned audit timing
[01:19:59 - 01:19:59] as i mentioned we've already
[01:20:00 - 01:20:02] started um so we did
[01:20:02 - 01:20:04] planning about two weeks ago
[01:20:04 - 01:20:04] and then last week and
[01:20:04 - 01:20:07] then this week we have
[01:20:07 - 01:20:07] been um doing our interim
[01:20:09 - 01:20:09] financial statement uh our interim
[01:20:12 - 01:20:12] testing that has mainly been
[01:20:12 - 01:20:15] that single audit um and
[01:20:15 - 01:20:15] so we were on site
[01:20:15 - 01:20:17] last week and then this
[01:20:17 - 01:20:17] week we were here on
[01:20:20 - 01:20:20] monday and tuesday we will
[01:20:20 - 01:20:22] come back in october so
[01:20:22 - 01:20:22] basically the whole month of
[01:20:24 - 01:20:24] october we'll be doing our
[01:20:24 - 01:20:27] final test work uh with
[01:20:27 - 01:20:29] the goal to finish everything
[01:20:29 - 01:20:29] get the acter to a
[01:20:29 - 01:20:32] great place uh before thanksgiving
[01:20:32 - 01:20:35] and then we will be
[01:20:35 - 01:20:35] back here um around december
[01:20:37 - 01:20:37] 3rd whatever that that meeting
[01:20:37 - 01:20:41] is and then the acter
[01:20:41 - 01:20:41] has to be submitted to
[01:20:45 - 01:20:45] the coordinating board by january
[01:20:45 - 01:20:48] 1st um but y'all are
[01:20:48 - 01:20:51] not here on january 1st
[01:20:51 - 01:20:51] so we always try to
[01:20:51 - 01:20:53] we get that out um
[01:20:53 - 01:20:53] before they leave for christmas
[01:20:57 - 01:20:57] which is about december 18th
[01:20:57 - 01:21:00] um so and we don't
[01:21:00 - 01:21:00] have any reasons to think
[01:21:00 - 01:21:02] that we won't be able
[01:21:02 - 01:21:02] to meet any of these
[01:21:05 - 01:21:05] timelines um our planned audit
[01:21:05 - 01:21:07] scope i'm not going to
[01:21:07 - 01:21:10] really go into this slide
[01:21:10 - 01:21:10] um this is just a
[01:21:10 - 01:21:13] lot of words for you
[01:21:13 - 01:21:13] to read but um i
[01:21:13 - 01:21:15] do want to just mention
[01:21:15 - 01:21:15] the risk areas so we
[01:21:15 - 01:21:17] do always look at management
[01:21:17 - 01:21:19] override of controls we mainly
[01:21:19 - 01:21:22] do that through our journal
[01:21:22 - 01:21:22] entry testing we also have
[01:21:22 - 01:21:24] uh fraud meetings with a
[01:21:24 - 01:21:26] bunch of people at hcc
[01:21:26 - 01:21:26] and we have been doing
[01:21:26 - 01:21:29] those the past couple of
[01:21:29 - 01:21:29] weeks just asking them if
[01:21:31 - 01:21:31] they are aware of anything
[01:21:31 - 01:21:33] um we also look at
[01:21:33 - 01:21:36] the improper revenue recognition so
[01:21:36 - 01:21:38] tuition revenue at the college
[01:21:38 - 01:21:38] is is kind of the
[01:21:38 - 01:21:39] biggest chunk of revenue y'all
[01:21:39 - 01:21:42] have so we do procedures
[01:21:42 - 01:21:42] around that um we do
[01:21:42 - 01:21:45] also look at the grant
[01:21:45 - 01:21:47] revenues um things like state
[01:21:47 - 01:21:49] appropriations and the tax revenues
[01:21:49 - 01:21:49] there's not as much of
[01:21:49 - 01:21:51] a risk but we do
[01:21:51 - 01:21:51] do procedures on those as
[01:21:52 - 01:21:52] well and then there's that
[01:21:54 - 01:21:54] non-compliance risk that i already
[01:21:54 - 01:21:56] non-compliance risk that i already
[01:21:57 - 01:21:58] mentioned mentioned um we do
[01:21:58 - 01:21:58] just like to let y'all
[01:21:58 - 01:22:01] know that we do use
[01:22:01 - 01:22:01] a third party so that
[01:22:01 - 01:22:03] is harvest investments they help
[01:22:03 - 01:22:05] us with our investment fair
[01:22:05 - 01:22:08] value testing so we send
[01:22:08 - 01:22:12] hcc's investment portfolio to harvest
[01:22:12 - 01:22:12] and they use a different
[01:22:15 - 01:22:15] valuation source and we compare
[01:22:15 - 01:22:17] it to what hcc is
[01:22:17 - 01:22:17] using just to make sure
[01:22:17 - 01:22:19] it's reasonable um we've never
[01:22:19 - 01:22:22] had any issues with it
[01:22:22 - 01:22:22] and we do also like
[01:22:22 - 01:22:24] to point out that the
[01:22:24 - 01:22:27] foundation is audited by other
[01:22:27 - 01:22:27] auditors so our opinion you
[01:22:29 - 01:22:29] will notice that there's a
[01:22:29 - 01:22:32] paragraph that just notes that
[01:22:32 - 01:22:35] the foundation is not included
[01:22:35 - 01:22:35] in our audit and then
[01:22:35 - 01:22:37] kind of the final big
[01:22:37 - 01:22:37] thing this year is that
[01:22:39 - 01:22:39] the um there's a new
[01:22:39 - 01:22:41] accounting standard well there's two
[01:22:41 - 01:22:45] actually but gazsby 102 is
[01:22:45 - 01:22:45] is really more of a
[01:22:47 - 01:22:47] disclosure only type thing that
[01:22:47 - 01:22:49] won't really affect the college
[01:22:49 - 01:22:51] but gazsby 101 so that's
[01:22:51 - 01:22:54] going to be uh compensated
[01:22:54 - 01:22:57] absences compensated absence liability has
[01:22:57 - 01:22:59] always been on the college's
[01:22:59 - 01:23:03] acer this standard really just
[01:23:03 - 01:23:05] um enhances the definition that
[01:23:05 - 01:23:09] was already out there it
[01:23:09 - 01:23:09] clarifies what should be in
[01:23:09 - 01:23:12] there um and it also
[01:23:12 - 01:23:12] ensures that what they call
[01:23:16 - 01:23:16] um salary related payments are
[01:23:16 - 01:23:18] included on there as well
[01:23:18 - 01:23:18] which would be um any
[01:23:20 - 01:23:20] type of payroll tax that
[01:23:20 - 01:23:23] you're having to pay um
[01:23:23 - 01:23:23] i know sherry and her
[01:23:23 - 01:23:26] team are looking at this
[01:23:26 - 01:23:28] standard right now um it
[01:23:28 - 01:23:30] will probably increase the liability
[01:23:30 - 01:23:30] a little bit but i
[01:23:30 - 01:23:33] don't expect it to have
[01:23:33 - 01:23:33] that big of an impact
[01:23:36 - 01:23:36] on the college um the
[01:23:36 - 01:23:38] college also already had a
[01:23:38 - 01:23:40] compensated absence disclosure um so
[01:23:40 - 01:23:44] this really won't affect that
[01:23:44 - 01:23:47] disclosure either um and then
[01:23:47 - 01:23:47] we do always like we
[01:23:47 - 01:23:51] asked um trustee uh van
[01:23:51 - 01:23:52] dibble stalworth last week but
[01:23:52 - 01:23:52] we always like to just
[01:23:54 - 01:23:54] put it out there as
[01:23:54 - 01:23:58] well if y'all are aware
[01:23:58 - 01:23:58] of any fraud or non-compliance
[01:24:01 - 01:24:01] um you can always you
[01:24:01 - 01:24:02] can say right now if
[01:24:02 - 01:24:02] you want but you can
[01:24:02 - 01:24:05] always just reach out to
[01:24:05 - 01:24:05] us um if you're aware
[01:24:05 - 01:24:08] of anything as well um
[01:24:08 - 01:24:10] based on the calls that
[01:24:10 - 01:24:10] we've had so far we
[01:24:10 - 01:24:12] have not nobody has told
[01:24:12 - 01:24:17] us anything so that's great
[01:24:17 - 01:24:17] um and um the last
[01:24:17 - 01:24:20] uh slide is just a
[01:24:20 - 01:24:20] link to our quality report

[01:24:50 - 01:24:52] conversation we resolved a lot

[01:24:54 - 01:24:54] little bit muddy and we

[01:59:52 - 01:59:52] chancellor for our first item
[01:59:52 - 01:59:54] we bring before you today
[01:59:54 - 01:59:56] revisions to hcc policy regarding
[01:59:56 - 01:59:57] free expression and free speech
[01:59:57 - 01:59:59] as the chancellor indicated the
[01:59:59 - 02:00:02] revised policies reflect changes in
[02:00:02 - 02:00:02] the law recently passed by
[02:00:04 - 02:00:04] the texas legislature under senate
[02:00:04 - 02:00:05] bill the texas legislature under
[02:00:05 - 02:00:08] senate bill 2972 2972 specifically
[02:00:08 - 02:00:08] this amends section specifically this
[02:00:09 - 02:00:10] amends section 51 9315 51
[02:00:10 - 02:00:12] 9315 of the texas education
[02:00:12 - 02:00:15] code the revisions allow expressive
[02:00:15 - 02:00:17] activities to those individuals associated
[02:00:17 - 02:00:19] with the college and also
[02:00:19 - 02:00:21] eliminates language that require colleges
[02:00:21 - 02:00:23] to allow any member of
[02:00:23 - 02:00:24] the general public to participate
[02:00:24 - 02:00:27] in expressive activities in the
[02:00:27 - 02:00:27] common outdoor areas of the
[02:00:27 - 02:00:29] campus instead we'll have zones
[02:00:29 - 02:00:32] for members of the public
[02:00:32 - 02:00:33] this policy requires institutions to
[02:00:33 - 02:00:37] amend their free seeds policies
[02:00:37 - 02:00:37] to add new time place
[02:00:37 - 02:00:39] and manner restrictions including specific
[02:00:42 - 02:00:42] restrictions on noise and camping
[02:00:44 - 02:00:44] the institution's policy does the
[02:00:46 - 02:00:48] following restrict amplified sound during
[02:00:48 - 02:00:48] class hours and exam periods
[02:00:51 - 02:00:51] prohibits bull horns prohibits camping
[02:00:54 - 02:00:54] and erecting tents prohibits concealing
[02:00:56 - 02:00:56] one's identity prohibits lowering in
[02:00:58 - 02:00:58] the institution's flag and raising
[02:00:58 - 02:01:00] a different flag requires students
[02:01:00 - 02:01:02] and employees to show id
[02:01:02 - 02:01:04] when requested the policy also
[02:01:04 - 02:01:08] prohibits expressive activities between 10
[02:01:08 - 02:01:10] pm and 800 am which
[02:01:10 - 02:01:10] is really about encampments at
[02:01:11 - 02:01:11] this time we are here
[02:01:11 - 02:01:13] to take any questions i
[02:01:13 - 02:01:13] also have lisa brown who's
[02:01:15 - 02:01:15] been assisting with us from
[02:01:15 - 02:01:18] the firm thompson horton uh
[02:01:18 - 02:01:18] is is there an exception
[02:01:18 - 02:01:21] if it is part of
[02:01:21 - 02:01:22] the actual part of the
[02:01:22 - 02:01:24] actual class class which part
[02:01:26 - 02:01:26] any of it like i
[02:01:26 - 02:01:28] can see a play happening
[02:01:28 - 02:01:28] where somebody has to wear
[02:01:28 - 02:01:30] a mask that's concealing your
[02:01:30 - 02:01:33] identity is that an exception
[02:01:35 - 02:01:39] good afternoon the law here
[02:01:39 - 02:01:40] is focused on outdoor common
[02:01:40 - 02:01:41] areas common areas right right
[02:01:45 - 02:01:45] and doesn't regulate the inside
[02:01:45 - 02:01:45] of a and doesn't regulate
[02:01:45 - 02:01:45] the inside of a building
[02:01:45 - 02:01:49] building okay great but we
[02:01:49 - 02:01:52] did add language specifically addressing
[02:01:52 - 02:01:56] a theatrical performance if uh
[02:01:56 - 02:01:56] a a group had on
[02:01:56 - 02:01:58] theater clothing and including a
[02:01:58 - 02:02:00] mask associated with a production
[02:02:00 - 02:02:00] they could certainly walk on
[02:02:03 - 02:02:03] campus carry or wearing that
[02:02:03 - 02:02:08] particular item as for indoor
[02:02:08 - 02:02:11] activities such as a classroom
[02:02:11 - 02:02:11] the regular rules that you
[02:02:13 - 02:02:15] have regarding classroom disruption would
[02:02:15 - 02:02:15] continue to apply in that
[02:02:19 - 02:02:19] environment and so uh the
[02:02:19 - 02:02:22] main restriction here uh in
[02:02:22 - 02:02:25] the new law other than
[02:02:25 - 02:02:27] adding uh the noise limitations
[02:02:27 - 02:02:27] and and that and encampments
[02:02:29 - 02:02:29] and that sort of language
[02:02:29 - 02:02:32] some of which you already
[02:02:32 - 02:02:32] had in regulation so that
[02:02:35 - 02:02:35] was simply moved to the
[02:02:35 - 02:02:37] policy to comply um with
[02:02:37 - 02:02:37] the law the the main
[02:02:41 - 02:02:41] difference is the legislature uh
[02:02:44 - 02:02:44] according to the history uh
[02:02:44 - 02:02:46] of the bill was very
[02:02:46 - 02:02:46] focused on making sure that
[02:02:50 - 02:02:50] employees and students have uh
[02:02:50 - 02:02:52] the right to exercise their
[02:02:52 - 02:02:55] first amendment rights in outdoor
[02:02:55 - 02:02:55] common areas and that members
[02:02:59 - 02:02:59] of the public uh also
[02:02:59 - 02:02:59] can in in many uh
[02:02:59 - 02:03:00] of the public uh also
[02:03:00 - 02:03:01] can in in many uh
[02:03:01 - 02:03:03] uh uh contexts also but
[02:03:03 - 02:03:06] that the administration will designate
[02:03:06 - 02:03:08] those areas so that we
[02:03:08 - 02:03:10] can maintain uh controls on
[02:03:10 - 02:03:10] disruption and and make sure
[02:03:12 - 02:03:12] that classroom activities and the
[02:03:15 - 02:03:15] operations of the college can
[02:03:15 - 02:03:17] um move forward without too
[02:03:17 - 02:03:19] much disruption okay thank you
[02:03:19 - 02:03:19] i just wanted to make
[02:03:20 - 02:03:20] sure that we weren't touching
[02:03:20 - 02:03:23] learning actual learning environments um
[02:03:23 - 02:03:25] uh did we get any
[02:03:25 - 02:03:25] input from tasby on this
[02:03:28 - 02:03:28] when we were making it
[02:03:28 - 02:03:30] or tasby's update that will
[02:03:30 - 02:03:32] include these legislative changes won't
[02:03:32 - 02:03:33] come out until later in
[02:03:33 - 02:03:33] the year i believe november
[02:03:35 - 02:03:35] december is typically when they
[02:03:35 - 02:03:37] release that and that's the
[02:03:37 - 02:03:39] reason i i think some
[02:03:39 - 02:03:39] of these bills go into
[02:03:39 - 02:03:43] effect on september 1st and
[02:03:43 - 02:03:43] so we were required to
[02:03:43 - 02:03:45] make our own revisions so
[02:03:45 - 02:03:46] when we get tasby's revisions
[02:03:46 - 02:03:46] we'll we'll merge those as
[02:03:49 - 02:03:49] it's as it's applicable or
[02:03:49 - 02:03:53] appropriate okay because we're paying
[02:03:53 - 02:03:55] for tasby's maybe we should
[02:03:55 - 02:03:55] make a comment like you
[02:03:58 - 02:03:58] need to get on top
[02:03:58 - 02:03:58] of this before we are
[02:04:00 - 02:04:00] legally required to do this
[02:04:00 - 02:04:01] stuff because if we're paying
[02:04:01 - 02:04:03] for the input we really
[02:04:03 - 02:04:03] need to i don't want
[02:04:03 - 02:04:04] to do this twice i
[02:04:06 - 02:04:06] agree um this has happened
[02:04:06 - 02:04:08] a couple of times now
[02:04:08 - 02:04:08] and i have mentioned it
[02:04:08 - 02:04:10] to tasby so we'll work
[02:04:10 - 02:04:12] on making an official comment
[02:04:12 - 02:04:12] to them because it also
[02:04:15 - 02:04:16] happened with title 9 sb17
[02:04:18 - 02:04:18] um there was a governor's
[02:04:18 - 02:04:20] order last year so it
[02:04:20 - 02:04:22] is something that i've already
[02:04:22 - 02:04:22] expressed to our contact at
[02:04:24 - 02:04:24] tasby but we can do
[02:04:24 - 02:04:24] something more tasby but we
[02:04:24 - 02:04:24] can do something more official
[02:04:24 - 02:04:26] official great thank you any

[02:09:48 - 02:09:50] for this upcoming academic year
[02:09:50 - 02:09:50] and in light of this
[02:09:50 - 02:09:51] we did have to go
[02:09:51 - 02:09:51] back and change our bylaws
[02:09:52 - 02:09:53] our standing rules and and
[02:09:53 - 02:09:55] how we were going to
[02:09:55 - 02:09:55] go forward so for the
[02:09:57 - 02:09:57] upcoming academic year we are
[02:09:57 - 02:09:59] actually going to rehold elections
[02:09:59 - 02:10:02] we are going to open
[02:10:02 - 02:10:02] our elections on august 15th
[02:10:05 - 02:10:05] based on those who were
[02:10:05 - 02:10:09] nominated last year re-accepting their
[02:10:09 - 02:10:10] nominations um and so they
[02:10:10 - 02:10:10] want to be involved in
[02:10:10 - 02:10:12] this academic year's senate based
[02:10:12 - 02:10:14] on the changes that have
[02:10:14 - 02:10:15] been made if they accept
[02:10:15 - 02:10:15] their nominations they will be
[02:10:17 - 02:10:17] on the new slate this
[02:10:17 - 02:10:19] opens on the 15th it
[02:10:19 - 02:10:19] will close on the 19th
[02:10:19 - 02:10:22] what we are hoping is
[02:10:22 - 02:10:22] after the uh uh board
[02:10:24 - 02:10:24] meeting on the 20th that
[02:10:24 - 02:10:27] slate is affirmed by madame
[02:10:27 - 02:10:28] chancellor um we will fill
[02:10:28 - 02:10:28] any vacant positions in a
[02:10:32 - 02:10:32] second round of elections on
[02:10:32 - 02:10:34] the tw 21st um to
[02:10:34 - 02:10:34] seat our senate on the
[02:10:34 - 02:10:36] 22nd at our 4 p
[02:10:36 - 02:10:36] m meeting at the end
[02:10:36 - 02:10:44] of we do have one
[02:10:44 - 02:10:47] amendment to the policy in
[02:10:47 - 02:10:47] which the reference to librarians
[02:10:51 - 02:10:51] that is in the section
[02:10:51 - 02:10:53] on the term we want
[02:10:53 - 02:10:53] to clarify that two members
[02:10:53 - 02:10:55] of the librarians will be
[02:10:55 - 02:10:58] elected and one will be
[02:10:58 - 02:10:58] appointed by the chancellor and
[02:10:58 - 02:11:03] i'll have melissa clarify so
[02:11:03 - 02:11:03] that's at the bottom of
[02:11:03 - 02:11:05] page one and so the
[02:11:05 - 02:11:05] reason that librarians is pulled
[02:11:07 - 02:11:07] out into a separate sentence
[02:11:07 - 02:11:08] there is because they don't
[02:11:08 - 02:11:10] fall under the colleges or
[02:11:10 - 02:11:13] divisions that are listed below
[02:11:13 - 02:11:13] but we wanted to ensure
[02:11:13 - 02:11:14] that they're being represented in
[02:11:14 - 02:11:16] the same way so just
[02:11:16 - 02:11:16] like any of those colleges
[02:11:18 - 02:11:18] or divisions one of their
[02:11:18 - 02:11:20] librarians will be appointed by
[02:11:20 - 02:11:22] the chancellor and the remainder
[02:11:22 - 02:11:22] two in this case will
[02:11:22 - 02:11:25] be elected to to participate
[02:11:25 - 02:11:26] in a faculty senate so
[02:11:26 - 02:11:26] they are considered to be
[02:11:29 - 02:11:29] under the definition that is
[02:11:29 - 02:11:30] proposed in this policy they're
[02:11:30 - 02:11:33] considered to be faculty which
[02:11:33 - 02:11:34] is consistent there there are
[02:11:34 - 02:11:36] varying definitions of faculty throughout
[02:11:36 - 02:11:39] the education code but librarian
[02:11:39 - 02:11:39] is has been included in
[02:11:39 - 02:11:41] that i believe it's included
[02:11:41 - 02:11:43] in senate bill 2615 which
[02:11:43 - 02:11:45] relates to teleawwork so it's
[02:11:45 - 02:11:45] it's not inconsistent with those
[02:11:47 - 02:11:47] other definitions to include faculty
[02:11:48 - 02:11:48] here and i believe that's
[02:11:48 - 02:11:50] been the practice so to
[02:11:50 - 02:11:50] stay with that as much
[02:11:52 - 02:11:52] as possible they're included here
[02:11:52 - 02:11:54] but we did want to
[02:11:54 - 02:11:56] clarify since they're in a
[02:11:56 - 02:11:56] different sentence that that one
[02:11:56 - 02:11:58] will be appointed and two
[02:11:58 - 02:12:00] will be elected and that
[02:12:00 - 02:12:00] language is not in the
[02:12:00 - 02:12:03] version that you have so
[02:12:03 - 02:12:05] we'd like to suggest an
[02:12:05 - 02:12:05] amendment to this policy to
[02:12:05 - 02:12:09] make sure that's clear so
[02:12:09 - 02:12:09] the number the number is
[02:12:09 - 02:12:10] not so the number the
[02:12:10 - 02:12:10] number is not changing changing
[02:12:10 - 02:12:13] changing correct correct all we're
[02:12:13 - 02:12:15] doing is um just clarifying
[02:12:15 - 02:12:16] that one will be appointed
[02:12:16 - 02:12:16] and the remainder will be
[02:12:18 - 02:12:18] elected just like any other
[02:12:18 - 02:12:18] college or elected just like
[02:12:19 - 02:12:19] any other college or division
[02:12:19 - 02:12:21] division was it like that
[02:12:21 - 02:12:23] before one appointed or is
[02:12:23 - 02:12:24] that what statute that's what
[02:12:24 - 02:12:26] the statute requires now requiring
[02:12:26 - 02:12:26] us to do one appointed
[02:12:26 - 02:12:28] and then two correct so
[02:12:28 - 02:12:28] so the statute says senate
[02:12:31 - 02:12:31] bill 37 says that each
[02:12:31 - 02:12:34] college or division will be
[02:12:34 - 02:12:36] represented by at least two
[02:12:36 - 02:12:38] representatives one will be appointed
[02:12:38 - 02:12:38] and the remainder will be
[02:12:41 - 02:12:41] elected so um i believe
[02:12:41 - 02:12:43] hcc and several other schools
[02:12:43 - 02:12:45] have proportionate representation so those
[02:12:45 - 02:12:47] larger schools may have more
[02:12:47 - 02:12:49] than two representatives in that
[02:12:49 - 02:12:49] case one is appointed and
[02:12:49 - 02:12:50] the rest of them are
[02:12:50 - 02:12:51] elected and so this just
[02:12:51 - 02:12:54] follows that okay so procedurally
[02:12:54 - 02:12:55] do we need to move
[02:12:55 - 02:12:55] to amend and go through
[02:12:55 - 02:12:56] that whole move to amend
[02:12:56 - 02:12:56] and go through that whole
[02:12:56 - 02:12:58] thing thing yes okay let
[02:12:58 - 02:12:58] me just ask this question
[02:13:01 - 02:13:01] first um i just want
[02:13:01 - 02:13:02] to ensure that to the
[02:13:02 - 02:13:02] extent possible we have worked
[02:13:06 - 02:13:06] together with the faculty senate
[02:13:06 - 02:13:08] and we feel as good
[02:13:08 - 02:13:08] about this as we can
[02:13:10 - 02:13:10] considering the parameters that we
[02:13:10 - 02:13:12] are required to follow by
[02:13:12 - 02:13:16] the bill i know it's
[02:13:16 - 02:13:16] not anybody's dream but um
[02:13:16 - 02:13:19] but because we have these
[02:13:19 - 02:13:21] um these bumpers in place
[02:13:21 - 02:13:21] i want to make sure
[02:13:21 - 02:13:24] that we've worked together and
[02:13:24 - 02:13:26] and feel comfortable with the
[02:13:26 - 02:13:26] work we've done with this
[02:13:26 - 02:13:27] yes um i will speak
[02:13:27 - 02:13:28] first and then i'll turn
[02:13:29 - 02:13:29] it over but yes from
[02:13:29 - 02:13:33] the beginning the task force
[02:13:33 - 02:13:35] has had broad representation not
[02:13:35 - 02:13:35] only uh the district level
[02:13:35 - 02:13:37] but the colleges and also
[02:13:37 - 02:13:39] the current faculty senate president
[02:13:39 - 02:13:42] and then the incoming presiding
[02:13:42 - 02:13:42] officer that we expect once
[02:13:45 - 02:13:45] the appointments are made and
[02:13:45 - 02:13:46] we have worked very collaboratively
[02:13:46 - 02:13:48] together and we've also already
[02:13:48 - 02:13:51] had meetings where the full
[02:13:51 - 02:13:51] faculty have been informed to
[02:13:53 - 02:13:53] get their input and their
[02:13:53 - 02:13:53] comment get their input and
[02:13:53 - 02:13:56] their comment okay okay i'll
[02:13:56 - 02:13:56] actually reiterate that um i
[02:13:56 - 02:13:58] will be i was very
[02:13:58 - 02:13:58] happy with the amount of
[02:14:00 - 02:14:00] input and involvement from different
[02:14:01 - 02:14:01] facets of the institution in
[02:14:01 - 02:14:03] terms of this i felt
[02:14:03 - 02:14:03] like we were all able
[02:14:03 - 02:14:05] to have a seat at
[02:14:05 - 02:14:05] the table and and to
[02:14:07 - 02:14:07] really discuss where some of
[02:14:07 - 02:14:09] the snags were um and
[02:14:09 - 02:14:09] where we could kind of
[02:14:09 - 02:14:11] meet in the middle on
[02:14:11 - 02:14:13] some things um there has
[02:14:13 - 02:14:13] been involvement across the whole
[02:14:14 - 02:14:14] time i believe i had
[02:14:14 - 02:14:16] a conversation in in may
[02:14:16 - 02:14:16] with dr ford fischer and
[02:14:16 - 02:14:18] since then there's been an
[02:14:18 - 02:14:21] investment in this and making
[02:14:21 - 02:14:21] sure that senate does exist
[02:14:23 - 02:14:23] um under the new guidelines
[02:14:23 - 02:14:25] uh but faculty involvement has
[02:14:25 - 02:14:26] been along the whole time
[02:14:26 - 02:14:27] okay and i and i
[02:14:27 - 02:14:28] really actually do appreciate that
[02:14:28 - 02:14:28] and i want to say
[02:14:28 - 02:14:32] thank you for that okay
[02:14:32 - 02:14:32] um the only other thing
[02:14:32 - 02:14:34] i want to say is
[02:14:34 - 02:14:34] i want to uh make
[02:14:34 - 02:14:37] sure that we're prepared during
[02:14:37 - 02:14:38] the board meeting to fill
[02:14:38 - 02:14:38] in we're going to have
[02:14:38 - 02:14:40] all the trustees here this
[02:14:40 - 02:14:40] is a big change so
[02:14:42 - 02:14:42] it's on the consent agenda
[02:14:42 - 02:14:44] but if it's pulled i
[02:14:44 - 02:14:44] want us to be prepared
[02:14:44 - 02:14:47] to present everything we need
[02:14:47 - 02:14:49] to to make people comfortable
[02:14:49 - 02:14:49] with uh this kind of
[02:14:52 - 02:14:52] joint work that uh i'm
[02:14:52 - 02:14:54] i'm happy to see that
[02:14:54 - 02:14:54] we work together i mean
[02:14:54 - 02:14:55] i'm you know considering what
[02:14:55 - 02:14:56] we need to do absolutely
[02:14:56 - 02:14:58] we will do that okay
[02:14:58 - 02:14:58] thank you uh any questions
[02:14:58 - 02:15:02] for my fellow trustees trusty
[02:15:02 - 02:15:07] wilson um you know i
[02:15:07 - 02:15:07] know this uh wasn't u
[02:15:07 - 02:15:10] uh a creation of the
[02:15:10 - 02:15:10] faculty senate and uh um
[02:15:13 - 02:15:13] it's something we have to
[02:15:13 - 02:15:15] deal with but as as
[02:15:15 - 02:15:15] a board member i would
[02:15:15 - 02:15:16] like you as as a
[02:15:16 - 02:15:17] board member i would like
[02:15:17 - 02:15:20] you know know to get
[02:15:20 - 02:15:20] some feel for the faculty
[02:15:20 - 02:15:22] senate and whether or not
[02:15:22 - 02:15:22] uh they can live with
[02:15:25 - 02:15:25] this and whether or not
[02:15:25 - 02:15:27] we can make some improvements
[02:15:27 - 02:15:27] or or what we need
[02:15:27 - 02:15:29] to do it's important i
[02:15:29 - 02:15:29] think to all of us
[02:15:29 - 02:15:33] as board members that uh
[02:15:33 - 02:15:35] our faculty senate isn't doesn't
[02:15:35 - 02:15:38] get run over by legislation
[02:15:38 - 02:15:38] and things like that so
[02:15:43 - 02:15:43] just could you comment on
[02:15:43 - 02:15:45] just a general no one
[02:15:45 - 02:15:45] wanted this to happen let
[02:15:45 - 02:15:47] me start by saying that
[02:15:47 - 02:15:50] no one wanted this to
[02:15:50 - 02:15:50] happen and there has been
[02:15:50 - 02:15:52] a lot of um debate
[02:15:52 - 02:15:54] conversations um angst behind this
[02:15:54 - 02:15:56] because you're you're exactly right
[02:15:56 - 02:15:57] we we didn't want to
[02:15:57 - 02:15:57] be walked over we didn't
[02:15:57 - 02:15:59] want to be forgotten we
[02:15:59 - 02:15:59] didn't want to be put
[02:16:01 - 02:16:01] aside for a year you
[02:16:01 - 02:16:02] know while like other institutions
[02:16:02 - 02:16:03] are doing to figure out
[02:16:03 - 02:16:03] what their senate is going
[02:16:03 - 02:16:08] to look like going forward
[02:16:08 - 02:16:08] um i believe that to
[02:16:10 - 02:16:10] the best extent possible all
[02:16:10 - 02:16:11] concerns have been addressed in
[02:16:11 - 02:16:14] a manner that meets the
[02:16:14 - 02:16:16] needs of sb37 um i've
[02:16:16 - 02:16:16] had conversations with nathan um
[02:16:18 - 02:16:18] and the executive committee as
[02:16:18 - 02:16:19] it stands right now and
[02:16:19 - 02:16:19] we know there may need
[02:16:21 - 02:16:21] some tweaks you know in
[02:16:21 - 02:16:23] the next year or two
[02:16:23 - 02:16:24] depending upon things because maybe
[02:16:24 - 02:16:24] we didn't get something right
[02:16:27 - 02:16:27] maybe we we missed something
[02:16:27 - 02:16:28] and we know that there's
[02:16:28 - 02:16:30] openness to have those further
[02:16:30 - 02:16:30] conversations on behalf of the
[02:16:31 - 02:16:31] administration as well as with
[02:16:31 - 02:16:34] the board um so you're
[02:16:34 - 02:16:35] you're absolutely right this this
[02:16:35 - 02:16:38] isn't anything anybody ever wanted
[02:16:38 - 02:16:38] you know um but you
[02:16:38 - 02:16:40] got to make the best
[02:16:40 - 02:16:40] of what we have and
[02:16:40 - 02:16:43] i think that we truly
[02:16:43 - 02:16:43] have done that in a
[02:16:45 - 02:16:45] manner that does show that
[02:16:45 - 02:16:47] we are still hcc and
[02:16:47 - 02:16:47] we're still hcc proud and
[02:16:48 - 02:16:48] faculty senate will still exist
[02:16:48 - 02:16:48] as we go faculty senate
[02:16:49 - 02:16:50] will still exist as we
[02:16:50 - 02:16:52] go forward forward thank you
[02:16:54 - 02:16:54] trusty thomas i think um
[02:16:54 - 02:16:56] that's a really good point
[02:16:56 - 02:16:59] that trustee uh wilson brings
[02:16:59 - 02:16:59] up and and the chair
[02:16:59 - 02:17:01] uh in the end it's
[02:17:01 - 02:17:04] about communication because we we

[02:17:28 - 02:17:30] notice they're the ones that

[02:17:50 - 02:17:52] you thank you trustee trusty
[02:17:52 - 02:17:54] chie i also had a
[02:17:54 - 02:17:56] word of thanks really wanted
[02:17:56 - 02:17:56] to thank the faculty senate
[02:17:56 - 02:17:58] and the faculty senators uh
[02:17:58 - 02:18:00] this is an unexpected change
[02:18:00 - 02:18:00] i think at there was
[02:18:01 - 02:18:01] a time when we thought
[02:18:01 - 02:18:03] this had dropped off the
[02:18:03 - 02:18:03] legislative agenda and then it
[02:18:05 - 02:18:05] came back shockingly at the
[02:18:05 - 02:18:07] very last minute um it
[02:18:07 - 02:18:09] was unexpected change it was
[02:18:09 - 02:18:09] a difficult change and it
[02:18:09 - 02:18:10] happened as everybody was walking
[02:18:10 - 02:18:12] into summer vacation um and
[02:18:12 - 02:18:14] the fact that the faculty
[02:18:14 - 02:18:14] senate was able to rally
[02:18:14 - 02:18:17] and have this constructive dialogue
[02:18:17 - 02:18:19] with uh the board the
[02:18:19 - 02:18:20] committee uh the administration i
[02:18:20 - 02:18:22] think that's a testament to
[02:18:22 - 02:18:23] the institution just really want
[02:18:23 - 02:18:23] to say thank you to
[02:18:25 - 02:18:25] everybody who who put their
[02:18:25 - 02:18:27] personal time aside at a
[02:18:27 - 02:18:28] time when y'all all desperately
[02:18:28 - 02:18:28] needed it after a really
[02:18:30 - 02:18:30] tough and productive year to
[02:18:30 - 02:18:31] make sure that we got
[02:18:31 - 02:18:35] this done before september the
[02:18:35 - 02:18:35] 1st um i do have
[02:18:35 - 02:18:39] um two questions one um
[02:18:39 - 02:18:39] there's like the last paragraph
[02:18:41 - 02:18:44] in sb37 um requires that
[02:18:44 - 02:18:46] each board um affirmatively attest
[02:18:46 - 02:18:48] that these changes have been
[02:18:48 - 02:18:48] made and that the faculty
[02:18:49 - 02:18:49] senate as constituted complies with
[02:18:51 - 02:18:51] sp37 just wanted to understand
[02:18:51 - 02:18:53] the timeline of when we're
[02:18:53 - 02:18:55] going to be able to
[02:18:55 - 02:18:55] do that just so that
[02:18:55 - 02:18:58] we do dot all the
[02:18:58 - 02:18:58] eyes and cross all the
[02:18:58 - 02:19:00] tees um and that everyone
[02:19:00 - 02:19:00] is is on the the
[02:19:00 - 02:19:02] right side of safe as
[02:19:02 - 02:19:02] we go forward into side
[02:19:02 - 02:19:02] of safe as we go
[02:19:02 - 02:19:05] forward into september september absolutely
[02:19:05 - 02:19:05] and so we are reviewing
[02:19:05 - 02:19:07] that requirement we actually got
[02:19:07 - 02:19:09] some input from tac this
[02:19:09 - 02:19:11] morning and so we've reached
[02:19:11 - 02:19:11] out for clarification on that
[02:19:13 - 02:19:13] we'll continue to review that
[02:19:13 - 02:19:14] if it turns out that
[02:19:14 - 02:19:16] that is required that there
[02:19:16 - 02:19:16] needs to be a resolution
[02:19:16 - 02:19:19] it will be on the
[02:19:19 - 02:19:21] agenda on august 20th thank
[02:19:21 - 02:19:21] you just one one one
[02:19:21 - 02:19:23] board member's opinion if that's
[02:19:23 - 02:19:25] an ambiguous thing i'd rather
[02:19:25 - 02:19:25] veer on the side of
[02:19:27 - 02:19:27] maybe acting when we don't
[02:19:27 - 02:19:28] have to just to make
[02:19:28 - 02:19:28] sure that we're buttoned up
[02:19:28 - 02:19:28] and to make sure that
[02:19:28 - 02:19:29] we're buttoned up and safe
[02:19:29 - 02:19:31] safe understood no i agree
[02:19:31 - 02:19:33] the uh the second question
[02:19:33 - 02:19:33] that i had is as
[02:19:33 - 02:19:36] y'all well know this is
[02:19:36 - 02:19:36] but one of many um
[02:19:37 - 02:19:37] opportunities that we have thanks
[02:19:37 - 02:19:41] to sp37 to update our
[02:19:41 - 02:19:42] policies um it would be
[02:19:42 - 02:19:42] helpful if if you can
[02:19:42 - 02:19:44] speak to it briefly now
[02:19:44 - 02:19:44] that would be great if
[02:19:44 - 02:19:46] not we can wait for
[02:19:46 - 02:19:46] a future meeting but an
[02:19:47 - 02:19:47] understanding of when those other
[02:19:50 - 02:19:50] elements of sb37 might be
[02:19:50 - 02:19:50] coming to the elements of
[02:19:51 - 02:19:52] sb37 might be coming to
[02:19:53 - 02:19:55] the board thank you trustee
[02:19:55 - 02:19:58] there are other components re
[02:19:58 - 02:19:58] relevant to sp37 and we
[02:20:00 - 02:20:00] had preliminary discussion i believe
[02:20:00 - 02:20:02] on monday with respect to
[02:20:02 - 02:20:04] those and i believe the
[02:20:04 - 02:20:04] date with not not in
[02:20:04 - 02:20:06] front of me i believe
[02:20:06 - 02:20:09] that date is november 2020
[02:20:09 - 02:20:12] what's that date again the
[02:20:12 - 02:20:14] effective date january it's no
[02:20:16 - 02:20:18] let me go ahead so
[02:20:18 - 02:20:18] that is correct uh the
[02:20:18 - 02:20:20] effective date begins january 1
[02:20:20 - 02:20:20] 2026 and then the plan
[02:20:22 - 02:20:22] is to come before the
[02:20:22 - 02:20:25] academic affairs committee um to
[02:20:25 - 02:20:25] do a report item in
[02:20:25 - 02:20:28] committee um to do a
[02:20:29 - 02:20:32] report item in september madam
[02:20:32 - 02:20:35] chair so just i guess
[02:20:35 - 02:20:35] on that is again i'm
[02:20:35 - 02:20:37] i'm not a lawyer not
[02:20:37 - 02:20:40] a legislator but i did
[02:20:40 - 02:20:40] read the text of xb37
[02:20:40 - 02:20:41] it sounds like there's additional
[02:20:41 - 02:20:43] policy changes that are going
[02:20:43 - 02:20:43] to have to be made
[02:20:43 - 02:20:45] um that is beyond the
[02:20:45 - 02:20:47] scope of the academic affairs
[02:20:47 - 02:20:47] committee and again this we
[02:20:48 - 02:20:48] don't have to discuss these
[02:20:48 - 02:20:49] now but it'd be helpful
[02:20:49 - 02:20:49] to see kind of a
[02:20:51 - 02:20:51] holistic mapping of which committee
[02:20:53 - 02:20:53] meetings be it this committee
[02:20:53 - 02:20:54] or the academic affairs or
[02:20:54 - 02:20:57] committee the whole that those
[02:20:57 - 02:20:58] will intersect with may i
[02:20:58 - 02:21:00] respond please yeah thank you
[02:21:00 - 02:21:00] very much that uh is
[02:21:00 - 02:21:03] a question that we addressed
[02:21:03 - 02:21:06] on monday at the chancellor's
[02:21:06 - 02:21:09] executive team meeting and there
[02:21:09 - 02:21:09] was a question about how
[02:21:09 - 02:21:10] do we move forward with
[02:21:10 - 02:21:12] the additional components one pertaining
[02:21:12 - 02:21:15] to the curricula another pertaining
[02:21:15 - 02:21:17] to the board and the
[02:21:17 - 02:21:20] reviewers etc of the curricula
[02:21:20 - 02:21:20] uh obviously one of the
[02:21:22 - 02:21:22] things that we found was
[02:21:22 - 02:21:23] that the task force worked
[02:21:23 - 02:21:26] extraordinarily well together and we
[02:21:26 - 02:21:28] decided that given that we're
[02:21:28 - 02:21:28] going to need additional members
[02:21:30 - 02:21:30] of our team who will
[02:21:30 - 02:21:33] appine on the curricula to
[02:21:33 - 02:21:33] be a part of it
[02:21:33 - 02:21:34] that those members of the
[02:21:34 - 02:21:37] task force would recommend additional
[02:21:37 - 02:21:39] uh faculty and staff members
[02:21:39 - 02:21:40] who would be included in
[02:21:41 - 02:21:41] the planning with respect to
[02:21:41 - 02:21:43] the curricula in order to
[02:21:43 - 02:21:45] move forward with that there
[02:21:45 - 02:21:45] was a timeline that was
[02:21:47 - 02:21:47] discussed as well for each
[02:21:47 - 02:21:49] of those components and it
[02:21:49 - 02:21:51] was decided that this group
[02:21:51 - 02:21:51] would bring that back to
[02:21:51 - 02:21:53] the next meeting and then
[02:21:53 - 02:21:56] we would provide that information
[02:21:56 - 02:21:56] to the board in the
[02:21:56 - 02:21:58] wab perfect so again one
[02:21:58 - 02:22:00] one trustes opinion um i
[02:22:00 - 02:22:02] know that there's a component
[02:22:02 - 02:22:02] of sp37 that calls for
[02:22:02 - 02:22:05] a review of certificates and
[02:22:05 - 02:22:08] um and minor programs i
[02:22:08 - 02:22:08] am very interested in seeing
[02:22:09 - 02:22:09] how we're going to pursue
[02:22:09 - 02:22:11] that sooner rather than later
[02:22:11 - 02:22:12] i think that's an excellent
[02:22:12 - 02:22:13] opportunity for this institution to
[02:22:13 - 02:22:13] get a bit ahead of
[02:22:13 - 02:22:15] the curve and maybe ahead
[02:22:15 - 02:22:16] of some of our peer
[02:22:16 - 02:22:18] institutions in complying with sp37
[02:22:18 - 02:22:18] so just one one trustes
[02:22:18 - 02:22:20] opinion that hopefully some input
[02:22:20 - 02:22:21] on how that plan gets
[02:22:21 - 02:22:22] formulated but thank you so
[02:22:22 - 02:22:23] plan gets formulated but thank
[02:22:24 - 02:22:27] you so much thank you
[02:22:27 - 02:22:27] and before i vote i
[02:22:27 - 02:22:29] just wanted to thank trusty

[02:22:34 - 02:22:36] we couldn't have done it

[02:31:02 - 02:31:04] reviewed some swat analysis as
[02:31:04 - 02:31:06] it relates to marketing and
[02:31:06 - 02:31:09] communication goals as we designed
[02:31:09 - 02:31:09] it collaborated it with our

[02:31:22 - 02:31:26] plan that i'm presenting so
[02:31:26 - 02:31:26] right now with this new
[02:31:26 - 02:31:29] plan we are intentionally aligning
[02:31:29 - 02:31:33] our effort to deliver student
[02:31:33 - 02:31:36] focus and datadriven campaigns that
[02:31:36 - 02:31:39] directly support hcc's institutional strategic
[02:31:39 - 02:31:49] plan through this strategy centers
[02:31:49 - 02:31:52] around hcc strategic plan specifically

[02:32:18 - 02:32:22] trust through transparent and impactful
[02:32:22 - 02:32:26] engagement so i do like
[02:32:26 - 02:32:26] to bring into our some
[02:32:26 - 02:32:30] of the main goals that
[02:32:30 - 02:32:32] we have designed um some
[02:32:32 - 02:32:32] of our goals primarily are
[02:32:34 - 02:32:34] continuation of our marketing and
[02:32:38 - 02:32:38] communication efforts but six goals
[02:32:38 - 02:32:42] that we have aligned um
[02:32:42 - 02:32:42] the the main one is
[02:32:46 - 02:32:46] student centered messaging not just
[02:32:46 - 02:32:49] at the time of recruitment
[02:32:49 - 02:32:51] and outreach but supporting them
[02:32:51 - 02:32:55] throughout their academic journey datadriven
[02:32:55 - 02:32:58] strategy to include kpis so
[02:32:58 - 02:33:02] we can make informed decisions
[02:33:02 - 02:33:04] innovation bringing in new technology
[02:33:04 - 02:33:04] and tools into the work
[02:33:04 - 02:33:07] that we are doing and
[02:33:07 - 02:33:11] obviously our new brand as
[02:33:11 - 02:33:11] a hcc city college so
[02:33:11 - 02:33:14] brand activation launching houston city
[02:33:14 - 02:33:15] activation launching houston city college
[02:33:15 - 02:33:17] college website relaunch that is
[02:33:17 - 02:33:20] something that is already ongoing
[02:33:20 - 02:33:24] and continued community engagement and
[02:33:24 - 02:33:27] collaboration i do want to
[02:33:27 - 02:33:27] focus a little bit on
[02:33:27 - 02:33:31] a student success as this
[02:33:31 - 02:33:33] is something a new approach
[02:33:33 - 02:33:33] a strategic approach as we
[02:33:35 - 02:33:35] are moving in that direction
[02:33:35 - 02:33:38] that will really allow us
[02:33:38 - 02:33:42] to be intentional and close
[02:33:42 - 02:33:42] any gaps as it relates
[02:33:42 - 02:33:45] to student success and messaging
[02:33:48 - 02:33:48] so as it relates to
[02:33:48 - 02:33:50] student success we are aligning
[02:33:50 - 02:33:53] our communication campaigns with key
[02:33:53 - 02:33:53] stages of the student life
[02:33:56 - 02:33:56] cycle ensuring that our messaging
[02:33:56 - 02:34:00] is tailored to targeted audiences
[02:34:02 - 02:34:02] as we rebrand houston city
[02:34:02 - 02:34:05] college our goal is not
[02:34:05 - 02:34:08] only to elevate the institutional
[02:34:08 - 02:34:11] image but also highlight and
[02:34:11 - 02:34:16] enhance the student experience to

[02:34:24 - 02:34:27] voices by sharing compelling student
[02:34:27 - 02:34:31] success stories that demonstrate the
[02:34:31 - 02:34:31] realworld impact of houston city
[02:34:42 - 02:34:42] i do have a couple
[02:34:42 - 02:34:45] of slides that we included
[02:34:45 - 02:34:45] here for uh for your
[02:34:45 - 02:34:48] review and any question that
[02:34:48 - 02:34:48] may as it relates to
[02:34:54 - 02:34:54] the next thing that i
[02:34:54 - 02:34:58] want to um focus on
[02:34:58 - 02:34:58] is the kpis so with
[02:34:58 - 02:35:02] the help of our institutional
[02:35:02 - 02:35:05] research team we have really
[02:35:05 - 02:35:05] defined some kpis what we
[02:35:05 - 02:35:07] can connected them directly with
[02:35:07 - 02:35:10] the student success so again

[02:35:13 - 02:35:16] as it relates to marketing
[02:35:16 - 02:35:20] and communication but really digging
[02:35:20 - 02:35:22] and getting into connecting this
[02:35:22 - 02:35:25] data with enrollment outreach student
[02:35:25 - 02:35:28] onboarding progression completion support and
[02:35:31 - 02:35:33] including alumni engagement so the
[02:35:33 - 02:35:37] kpis um and the data
[02:35:37 - 02:35:41] that we have we have
[02:35:41 - 02:35:41] highlighted here it will provide
[02:35:44 - 02:35:44] us with some tools that
[02:35:44 - 02:35:47] will offer us campaign success
[02:35:47 - 02:35:51] tracking through the engagement matrix
[02:35:51 - 02:35:53] enrollment data brand sentiment analysis
[02:35:53 - 02:35:59] and partnership growth ensuring accountability

[02:36:01 - 02:36:05] our marketing and communication team
[02:36:05 - 02:36:10] to make data informed budget
[02:36:10 - 02:36:10] conscious decision and also to

[02:36:27 - 02:36:30] and datainformed decision making enabling

[02:39:45 - 02:39:48] for your thoughts so trustee
[02:39:48 - 02:39:48] th this is a very
[02:39:48 - 02:39:50] good question and this is
[02:39:50 - 02:39:50] what we are working on
[02:39:54 - 02:39:54] meeting with the team on
[02:39:54 - 02:39:56] daily basis to uh to
[02:39:56 - 02:39:56] have that plan ready but
[02:39:56 - 02:40:01] i'm going to let todd
[02:40:01 - 02:40:02] speak to that well i
[02:40:02 - 02:40:02] think one of the things
[02:40:02 - 02:40:05] we're going to do is
[02:40:05 - 02:40:07] uh we've been meeting with
[02:40:07 - 02:40:12] the communications directors and one
[02:40:12 - 02:40:12] thing we plan on doing
[02:40:12 - 02:40:14] is starting a marketing and
[02:40:14 - 02:40:16] communications council we'll involve the
[02:40:16 - 02:40:18] presidents the vice presidents the
[02:40:18 - 02:40:20] communications directors so we can
[02:40:20 - 02:40:20] get this information and bring
[02:40:22 - 02:40:22] it to you um are
[02:40:22 - 02:40:24] there three things uh from
[02:40:24 - 02:40:24] that level we will be
[02:40:24 - 02:40:26] coming from that from that
[02:40:26 - 02:40:28] group to determine those for
[02:40:28 - 02:40:29] you thank you that it
[02:40:29 - 02:40:31] it would be fantastic to
[02:40:31 - 02:40:31] receive an update on what
[02:40:31 - 02:40:34] those kind of highlevel um
[02:40:34 - 02:40:36] marketing messages are at some
[02:40:36 - 02:40:36] once they're developed um you
[02:40:38 - 02:40:38] know blake and i were
[02:40:38 - 02:40:40] having a a great conversation
[02:40:40 - 02:40:40] before about the district 5
[02:40:42 - 02:40:42] newsletter and about different messages
[02:40:43 - 02:40:43] that we wanted to kind
[02:40:43 - 02:40:45] of thread through the the
[02:40:45 - 02:40:46] micro articles that were included
[02:40:46 - 02:40:46] in that and it just
[02:40:46 - 02:40:49] got me thinking be great
[02:40:49 - 02:40:50] to align that thread with
[02:40:50 - 02:40:50] the threads that y'all are
[02:40:50 - 02:40:53] thinking the high-grade would you
[02:40:53 - 02:40:55] like to address that thank
[02:40:55 - 02:40:55] you so very much i
[02:40:55 - 02:41:00] would like to respond when
[02:41:00 - 02:41:03] we were involved in the
[02:41:03 - 02:41:05] visioning for the strategic planning
[02:41:05 - 02:41:05] for marketing and strategic planning
[02:41:06 - 02:41:07] for marketing and communications communications
[02:41:09 - 02:41:09] we knew that there were
[02:41:09 - 02:41:12] so many wraparound services that
[02:41:12 - 02:41:16] hcc has available for students
[02:41:16 - 02:41:18] that are missed altogether in
[02:41:18 - 02:41:18] a lot of the marketing
[02:41:21 - 02:41:21] that is done so when
[02:41:21 - 02:41:24] you consider that we have
[02:41:24 - 02:41:24] the digital access centers when
[02:41:27 - 02:41:27] we have the tutoring we
[02:41:27 - 02:41:29] have student success stories of
[02:41:29 - 02:41:32] course but then when we
[02:41:32 - 02:41:32] have the advisors we have
[02:41:32 - 02:41:33] the range of programs that
[02:41:33 - 02:41:36] are available throughout our district
[02:41:36 - 02:41:39] what we want to convey
[02:41:39 - 02:41:39] is that whatever it is
[02:41:39 - 02:41:42] that a student will want
[02:41:42 - 02:41:44] or need to advance their
[02:41:44 - 02:41:47] education their training their lives
[02:41:47 - 02:41:47] hcc has it so what
[02:41:47 - 02:41:50] we have then we have
[02:41:50 - 02:41:53] students who are homeless so
[02:41:53 - 02:41:53] if there is a billboard
[02:41:53 - 02:41:56] or if there is some
[02:41:56 - 02:41:56] desire for a student to
[02:41:56 - 02:42:00] come to college to get
[02:42:00 - 02:42:00] a credential but does not
[02:42:03 - 02:42:03] have a place to reside
[02:42:03 - 02:42:05] then we have those services
[02:42:05 - 02:42:08] to support those students that
[02:42:08 - 02:42:08] is a billboard that could
[02:42:11 - 02:42:12] conceivably change that person's life
[02:42:15 - 02:42:15] forever the next is if
[02:42:15 - 02:42:18] there is food insecurity and
[02:42:18 - 02:42:21] there are family members that
[02:42:21 - 02:42:21] are struggling to feed their
[02:42:23 - 02:42:23] families then if there is
[02:42:23 - 02:42:27] a billboard that says hcc
[02:42:27 - 02:42:30] provides food pantries for students
[02:42:30 - 02:42:30] who are enrolled but who
[02:42:30 - 02:42:33] are having food insecurity issues
[02:42:33 - 02:42:35] go to each of our
[02:42:35 - 02:42:37] campuses we provide that for
[02:42:37 - 02:42:37] you that is what's bringing
[02:42:37 - 02:42:39] in a lot of our
[02:42:39 - 02:42:40] students if there is a
[02:42:43 - 02:42:43] student who needs online tutoring
[02:42:46 - 02:42:46] because that person is working
[02:42:46 - 02:42:49] and we can say that
[02:42:49 - 02:42:53] we have tutoring available on
[02:42:53 - 02:42:53] campus and online at every
[02:42:53 - 02:42:56] pardon me single program area
[02:42:56 - 02:42:58] that we have that would
[02:42:58 - 02:42:58] attract students so the general
[02:43:02 - 02:43:02] theme is as we look
[02:43:02 - 02:43:05] at that strategic marketing and
[02:43:05 - 02:43:07] communications plan for student success
[02:43:10 - 02:43:10] the students need to know
[02:43:10 - 02:43:12] not just what we have
[02:43:12 - 02:43:12] available to help them to
[02:43:15 - 02:43:15] succeed in college but also
[02:43:15 - 02:43:17] it provides that opportunity then
[02:43:17 - 02:43:20] for them to know which
[02:43:20 - 02:43:23] programs there are which businesses
[02:43:23 - 02:43:25] and industries support us which
[02:43:25 - 02:43:28] students have achieved success and
[02:43:28 - 02:43:28] so if we have a
[02:43:28 - 02:43:31] student who has gone through
[02:43:31 - 02:43:31] the engineering program and has
[02:43:35 - 02:43:35] earned a great job and
[02:43:35 - 02:43:38] is now earning a high
[02:43:38 - 02:43:38] income then that can be
[02:43:38 - 02:43:39] a message as well that
[02:43:39 - 02:43:39] is sent out that would
[02:43:43 - 02:43:43] inspire other aspiring engineers and
[02:43:43 - 02:43:47] so that goes that continues
[02:43:47 - 02:43:50] now there are plans that
[02:43:50 - 02:43:50] are in place to determine
[02:43:54 - 02:43:54] just exactly how we are
[02:43:54 - 02:43:58] able to take all of
[02:43:58 - 02:43:58] those clicks on a website
[02:44:02 - 02:44:02] clicks on any of the
[02:44:02 - 02:44:06] social media posts in order
[02:44:06 - 02:44:09] to capture those individuals and
[02:44:09 - 02:44:09] then to convert those into
[02:44:11 - 02:44:11] enrollments and then to student
[02:44:11 - 02:44:13] success and the members of
[02:44:13 - 02:44:15] the team can share that
[02:44:15 - 02:44:15] with you as well as
[02:44:15 - 02:44:18] we discuss that also in
[02:44:18 - 02:44:18] the planning session but what
[02:44:20 - 02:44:20] we have found is that
[02:44:20 - 02:44:23] there are other colleges that
[02:44:23 - 02:44:27] are beginning to focus more
[02:44:27 - 02:44:27] on marketing communications as well
[02:44:29 - 02:44:29] as it directs their messaging
[02:44:29 - 02:44:32] directly to students not necessarily
[02:44:32 - 02:44:36] to the broad messaging but
[02:44:36 - 02:44:38] to intentional messaging so i
[02:44:38 - 02:44:38] think this is this is
[02:44:38 - 02:44:40] really key i think is
[02:44:40 - 02:44:40] going to make a big
[02:44:40 - 02:44:43] difference and i would like
[02:44:43 - 02:44:43] for dr d to share
[02:44:46 - 02:44:46] those clicks and what she's
[02:44:46 - 02:44:48] doing now with the website
[02:44:48 - 02:44:51] because we know that there
[02:44:51 - 02:44:51] are broken links on our
[02:44:51 - 02:44:53] website that prevent students from
[02:44:53 - 02:44:56] easily enrolling with hcc so
[02:44:56 - 02:44:59] if you could briefly discuss
[02:44:59 - 02:44:59] that dr adil i would
[02:45:00 - 02:45:04] appreciate it um thank you
[02:45:04 - 02:45:06] chancellor um so quickly want
[02:45:06 - 02:45:06] to uh recap some of
[02:45:06 - 02:45:09] the communication campaigns as as
[02:45:09 - 02:45:13] mentioned by the chancellor the
[02:45:13 - 02:45:17] some of these tactics are
[02:45:17 - 02:45:17] discussed on page 9 10
[02:45:17 - 02:45:21] and 11 this messaging is
[02:45:21 - 02:45:24] around the student success um
[02:45:24 - 02:45:24] we might have done as
[02:45:28 - 02:45:32] chanced previously generic messaging but
[02:45:32 - 02:45:32] there are tools available with
[02:45:32 - 02:45:35] ai with with a lot
[02:45:35 - 02:45:35] of smart tools that is
[02:45:39 - 02:45:39] really can do targeted messaging
[02:45:39 - 02:45:43] to the audience whether it
[02:45:43 - 02:45:46] is programmed needs or whether
[02:45:46 - 02:45:46] it is their uh individual
[02:45:49 - 02:45:49] circumstances and based on individual
[02:45:53 - 02:45:53] characteristics um it could be
[02:45:53 - 02:45:56] student parents it could be
[02:45:56 - 02:46:00] single parents it could be
[02:46:00 - 02:46:00] veterans it could so there
[02:46:00 - 02:46:02] are uh systems in place
[02:46:02 - 02:46:07] and current technology allow us
[02:46:07 - 02:46:09] to really market to what
[02:46:09 - 02:46:09] they are looking for so
[02:46:09 - 02:46:13] that is one thing i
[02:46:13 - 02:46:13] want to focus on secondly
[02:46:16 - 02:46:16] the as it relates to
[02:46:16 - 02:46:16] the the the the as
[02:46:17 - 02:46:17] it relates to the the
[02:46:18 - 02:46:20] the website website um our
[02:46:20 - 02:46:20] team has already been working
[02:46:20 - 02:46:23] on the new website when
[02:46:23 - 02:46:27] as we are bringing that
[02:46:27 - 02:46:27] um uh the the new
[02:46:27 - 02:46:30] platform what we are doing
[02:46:30 - 02:46:34] we have positioned some extra
[02:46:34 - 02:46:34] resources to make sure that
[02:46:37 - 02:46:37] we clean up our website
[02:46:37 - 02:46:41] um which was scheduled to
[02:46:41 - 02:46:43] be done october september october
[02:46:43 - 02:46:43] we are pulling it up
[02:46:43 - 02:46:46] and we're cleaning up that
[02:46:46 - 02:46:46] is one of our urgent
[02:46:49 - 02:46:49] um uh matter that we
[02:46:49 - 02:46:53] are trying to resolve so
[02:46:53 - 02:46:53] we can really have data
[02:46:53 - 02:46:58] that is uh removing any
[02:46:58 - 02:47:00] broken links and doing our
[02:47:00 - 02:47:00] content audit so that is
[02:47:02 - 02:47:02] something that we want to
[02:47:02 - 02:47:05] do as an institution in
[02:47:05 - 02:47:08] collaboration with our campus leadership
[02:47:08 - 02:47:12] and our um leadership at
[02:47:12 - 02:47:14] the district thank you there
[02:47:14 - 02:47:17] any other questions i do
[02:47:17 - 02:47:17] can we look at page
[02:47:17 - 02:47:19] 10 please these are the
[02:47:19 - 02:47:21] key audiences that we're working
[02:47:21 - 02:47:23] with what are the current
[02:47:23 - 02:47:25] percentages of students in these
[02:47:25 - 02:47:28] key audiences and what are
[02:47:28 - 02:47:32] we aiming for um that
[02:47:32 - 02:47:32] would be interesting to know
[02:47:32 - 02:47:34] and the reason being is
[02:47:34 - 02:47:36] that each of these audiences
[02:47:36 - 02:47:36] you have to have a
[02:47:36 - 02:47:40] different tactic to reach them
[02:47:40 - 02:47:41] the standard the standard system
[02:47:41 - 02:47:42] that we've had in the
[02:47:45 - 02:47:45] past no longer applies um
[02:47:45 - 02:47:48] i was at an event
[02:47:48 - 02:47:48] this morning uh young parents
[02:47:51 - 02:47:51] uh at a at at
[02:47:51 - 02:47:51] the high school in my
[02:47:54 - 02:47:54] district uh for parents who
[02:47:54 - 02:47:57] had resource needs and um
[02:47:57 - 02:48:00] they were in line at
[02:48:00 - 02:48:00] 8 00 in the morning
[02:48:00 - 02:48:02] 7 00 in the morning
[02:48:02 - 02:48:02] 8 00 in the morning
[02:48:02 - 02:48:05] for a 9 00 opening
[02:48:05 - 02:48:05] uh for support for their
[02:48:05 - 02:48:07] young children made quite a
[02:48:07 - 02:48:09] few young children but the
[02:48:09 - 02:48:13] parents were young enough to
[02:48:13 - 02:48:13] come to hcc for class
[02:48:13 - 02:48:15] and none of them had
[02:48:15 - 02:48:15] been approached by hcc in
[02:48:15 - 02:48:19] a in a in a
[02:48:19 - 02:48:22] cafeteria filled with parents and
[02:48:22 - 02:48:22] young students i every parent
[02:48:22 - 02:48:25] i talked to and i
[02:48:25 - 02:48:27] went tableto table one parent
[02:48:27 - 02:48:27] said she had her daughter
[02:48:27 - 02:48:31] in dual credit and i
[02:48:31 - 02:48:33] thought that was really that
[02:48:33 - 02:48:33] was really interesting so it
[02:48:35 - 02:48:35] would be good for the
[02:48:35 - 02:48:37] board to know what the
[02:48:37 - 02:48:37] current percentages are for each
[02:48:37 - 02:48:41] of these uh key audiences
[02:48:41 - 02:48:44] uh in terms of enrollment
[02:48:44 - 02:48:44] and what we're aiming for
[02:48:46 - 02:48:46] something that the team the
[02:48:46 - 02:48:48] central college team did this
[02:48:48 - 02:48:52] morning they had a a
[02:48:52 - 02:48:52] q code for students for
[02:48:52 - 02:48:56] people to take a a
[02:48:56 - 02:48:56] survey on dual credit but
[02:48:56 - 02:48:59] it had a it had
[02:48:59 - 02:48:59] a a secondary value in
[02:48:59 - 02:49:02] that they captured all of
[02:49:02 - 02:49:04] the data from that person
[02:49:04 - 02:49:04] without having any of it
[02:49:04 - 02:49:07] written down i thought that
[02:49:07 - 02:49:09] was spectacular and it gave
[02:49:09 - 02:49:09] them an opportunity it gave
[02:49:09 - 02:49:11] the central college team an
[02:49:11 - 02:49:14] opportunity to go back and
[02:49:14 - 02:49:14] cull through that list which
[02:49:18 - 02:49:18] is now online and see
[02:49:18 - 02:49:20] what what the student interests
[02:49:20 - 02:49:22] look like what the parent
[02:49:22 - 02:49:22] interests look like uh because
[02:49:24 - 02:49:24] some of these parents had
[02:49:24 - 02:49:26] high school kids some of
[02:49:26 - 02:49:29] these parents had babies from
[02:49:29 - 02:49:29] 3 to six years old
[02:49:29 - 02:49:33] so it was very good
[02:49:33 - 02:49:33] to see that that uh
[02:49:33 - 02:49:37] qode use i had not
[02:49:37 - 02:49:37] seen it before um my
[02:49:37 - 02:49:40] third point is on social
[02:49:40 - 02:49:42] media southwest college has everybody
[02:49:42 - 02:49:46] be have to say it
[02:49:46 - 02:49:48] they have everybody be if
[02:49:48 - 02:49:48] you if you are playing
[02:49:48 - 02:49:50] a game southwest college pops
[02:49:50 - 02:49:53] up on social media if
[02:49:53 - 02:49:53] you are scrolling looking for
[02:49:55 - 02:49:55] something southwest college pops up
[02:49:56 - 02:49:58] on social media if you
[02:49:58 - 02:50:00] are going on your way
[02:50:00 - 02:50:00] to a website southwest college
[02:50:00 - 02:50:03] pops up on social media
[02:50:03 - 02:50:07] they have they have figured
[02:50:07 - 02:50:07] out a way to be
[02:50:07 - 02:50:08] everywhere i would say everything
[02:50:08 - 02:50:12] everywhere all at once they
[02:50:12 - 02:50:15] are actually incredibly successful at
[02:50:15 - 02:50:15] it if you can play
[02:50:15 - 02:50:19] an a a nondescript game
[02:50:19 - 02:50:22] and hcc pops up that's
[02:50:22 - 02:50:22] a hell of a team
[02:50:22 - 02:50:26] they have figured it out
[02:50:26 - 02:50:26] and that's not just uh
[02:50:29 - 02:50:29] facebook and instagram um and
[02:50:29 - 02:50:31] i noticed we looked at
[02:50:31 - 02:50:31] some of the uh some
[02:50:34 - 02:50:34] of the social media sites
[02:50:34 - 02:50:37] we have x we don't
[02:50:37 - 02:50:37] have fan base on this
[02:50:37 - 02:50:39] site in this in this
[02:50:39 - 02:50:39] system and we don't have
[02:50:39 - 02:50:43] linked tree um and they're
[02:50:43 - 02:50:46] up and coming i think
[02:50:46 - 02:50:46] our greatest success on on
[02:50:48 - 02:50:48] visitation is actually linkedin i
[02:50:48 - 02:50:52] think we have what 130
[02:50:52 - 02:50:52] 000 people in one group
[02:50:55 - 02:50:55] on linkedin from hcc that's
[02:50:55 - 02:50:58] pretty impressive um i do
[02:50:58 - 02:51:01] not know what their demographic
[02:51:01 - 02:51:01] looks like if it's if
[02:51:02 - 02:51:03] it's graduates if they're alum
[02:51:03 - 02:51:05] if they're students or if
[02:51:05 - 02:51:07] they're people just affiliated somehow
[02:51:07 - 02:51:10] with the hcc foundation but
[02:51:10 - 02:51:10] it is it is pretty
[02:51:13 - 02:51:13] extraordinary to have 130 000
[02:51:13 - 02:51:16] people in one group that's
[02:51:16 - 02:51:19] a real extraordinary perception so
[02:51:19 - 02:51:19] each of these key perception
[02:51:19 - 02:51:20] so each of these key
[02:51:21 - 02:51:23] audiences audiences have to be
[02:51:23 - 02:51:23] spoken to in a particular
[02:51:23 - 02:51:24] have to be spoken to
[02:51:24 - 02:51:25] in a particular manner manner
[02:51:29 - 02:51:29] one size will not fit
[02:51:29 - 02:51:32] all of these um uh
[02:51:32 - 02:51:32] and at at south campus
[02:51:32 - 02:51:35] we did a backpack drive
[02:51:35 - 02:51:37] and the the welding students
[02:51:37 - 02:51:39] they were graduating they were
[02:51:39 - 02:51:39] finishing up and there was
[02:51:39 - 02:51:40] a young there were two
[02:51:40 - 02:51:42] young ladies in the welding
[02:51:42 - 02:51:42] class and they were pretty
[02:51:44 - 02:51:44] extraordinary and so i videotaped
[02:51:44 - 02:51:46] them because i wanted to
[02:51:46 - 02:51:49] know what they thought and
[02:51:49 - 02:51:49] they were very pleased uh
[02:51:51 - 02:51:51] i found a young man
[02:51:51 - 02:51:52] in at the in the
[02:51:53 - 02:51:53] electrical he was graduating with
[02:51:53 - 02:51:55] his electrical certification he said
[02:51:55 - 02:51:56] oh no i'm coming back
[02:51:56 - 02:51:58] for level two level three
[02:51:58 - 02:51:58] two year he said you
[02:51:58 - 02:52:00] know i thought it was
[02:52:00 - 02:52:02] hard he said it wasn't
[02:52:02 - 02:52:02] hard at all so i'm
[02:52:02 - 02:52:05] coming back and he was
[02:52:05 - 02:52:05] driving 30 miles one way
[02:52:05 - 02:52:08] just to do it so
[02:52:08 - 02:52:08] and they were young i
[02:52:10 - 02:52:10] think that the oldest i
[02:52:10 - 02:52:12] think the young man i
[02:52:12 - 02:52:12] talked to was 25 the
[02:52:12 - 02:52:15] young lady was 17 and
[02:52:15 - 02:52:18] she got two welding certificates
[02:52:18 - 02:52:18] so we are we are
[02:52:18 - 02:52:19] really certificates so we are
[02:52:19 - 02:52:20] we are really poised poised
[02:52:23 - 02:52:23] to open the door for
[02:52:23 - 02:52:26] these key audiences if we
[02:52:26 - 02:52:26] know what our percentage of
[02:52:29 - 02:52:29] students are currently and where
[02:52:29 - 02:52:32] we want how what how
[02:52:32 - 02:52:32] many do we want do
[02:52:32 - 02:52:35] do we want to increase
[02:52:35 - 02:52:38] this by 5 maybe returning
[02:52:38 - 02:52:38] students by 20 maybe lower
[02:52:40 - 02:52:40] socioeconomic by 10 high school
[02:52:40 - 02:52:45] grads ged um dual credit
[02:52:45 - 02:52:48] we've talked about dual credit
[02:52:48 - 02:52:48] at nauseium i'm still not
[02:52:50 - 02:52:50] happy that san antonio could
[02:52:50 - 02:52:53] have 20 000 dual credit
[02:52:53 - 02:52:53] students and we do not
[02:52:53 - 02:52:56] i am i'm really not
[02:52:56 - 02:52:56] happy with that um but
[02:52:58 - 02:52:58] to see this list this
[02:52:58 - 02:53:00] key audience list is excellent
[02:53:00 - 02:53:00] now what does it look
[02:53:02 - 02:53:02] like and what do we
[02:53:02 - 02:53:02] want it to look like
[02:53:06 - 02:53:06] and how do we talk
[02:53:06 - 02:53:08] to them because you cannot
[02:53:08 - 02:53:08] talk to a dual credit
[02:53:08 - 02:53:10] student the same way you
[02:53:10 - 02:53:12] talk to a multicultural student
[02:53:12 - 02:53:12] the same way you talk
[02:53:12 - 02:53:14] to a lifelong learner the
[02:53:14 - 02:53:16] same way you talk to
[02:53:16 - 02:53:18] a lower socioeconomic potential student
[02:53:18 - 02:53:18] and i'd like to see
[02:53:18 - 02:53:20] that and i know that
[02:53:20 - 02:53:20] you have those analytics so
[02:53:22 - 02:53:22] we want to know because
[02:53:22 - 02:53:25] this board is going to
[02:53:25 - 02:53:25] have to make a decision
[02:53:25 - 02:53:27] on how our strategic goals
[02:53:27 - 02:53:27] are going to line up
[02:53:29 - 02:53:29] with what this team is
[02:53:29 - 02:53:32] going to have to do
[02:53:32 - 02:53:32] and my toughest question is
[02:53:32 - 02:53:41] where is app the app
[02:53:41 - 02:53:45] okay there's no app students
[02:53:45 - 02:53:45] do things on their phones
[02:53:49 - 02:53:49] an app that they can
[02:53:49 - 02:53:51] fill out and they can
[02:53:51 - 02:53:51] go into the system and
[02:53:51 - 02:53:53] they can find their classes
[02:53:53 - 02:53:55] without an app we're probably
[02:53:55 - 02:53:57] missing half of them right
[02:53:57 - 02:53:59] and thank you very much
[02:53:59 - 02:54:02] mr chair and i'd like
[02:54:02 - 02:54:02] to to ask um dr
[02:54:02 - 02:54:04] burrish to respond to the
[02:54:04 - 02:54:04] numbers and of course dr
[02:54:04 - 02:54:06] dill and i've had conversations
[02:54:06 - 02:54:08] about this as well and
[02:54:08 - 02:54:08] about an app but i'd
[02:54:08 - 02:54:11] like to say in advance
[02:54:11 - 02:54:15] that dr adil was selected
[02:54:15 - 02:54:15] to become an acce fellow
[02:54:15 - 02:54:16] and she's one of the
[02:54:16 - 02:54:18] fellows who will be working
[02:54:18 - 02:54:18] in fact she flew back
[02:54:18 - 02:54:20] in this morning from dc
[02:54:20 - 02:54:23] where they had their first
[02:54:23 - 02:54:23] session and she has been
[02:54:23 - 02:54:26] um placed at maricopa community
[02:54:26 - 02:54:29] colleges to work with them
[02:54:29 - 02:54:29] on a periodic basis maricopa
[02:54:32 - 02:54:32] community college district for years
[02:54:35 - 02:54:35] have had more than 260
[02:54:35 - 02:54:38] 000 students enrolled uh she's
[02:54:38 - 02:54:40] had the great privilege of
[02:54:40 - 02:54:43] having conversations with them just
[02:54:43 - 02:54:45] recently and will be interacting
[02:54:45 - 02:54:45] with them uh on a
[02:54:45 - 02:54:48] regular basis uh in talking
[02:54:48 - 02:54:48] to the lady who was
[02:54:51 - 02:54:51] chancellor there uh she was
[02:54:51 - 02:54:53] really very delighted with all
[02:54:53 - 02:54:54] of the apps that they
[02:54:56 - 02:54:56] had in place all of
[02:54:56 - 02:54:59] the strategies that they were
[02:54:59 - 02:54:59] using etc so we have
[02:54:59 - 02:55:01] access to that information now
[02:55:01 - 02:55:04] in partnership with them and
[02:55:04 - 02:55:04] with one of our key
[02:55:04 - 02:55:06] team members being involved in
[02:55:06 - 02:55:09] that conversation with them as
[02:55:09 - 02:55:12] well but with respect to
[02:55:12 - 02:55:12] the data uh dr burish
[02:55:12 - 02:55:14] will address that and what
[02:55:14 - 02:55:16] we're doing to respond to
[02:55:16 - 02:55:18] the diverse populations and the
[02:55:18 - 02:55:18] diverse needs of our students
[02:55:21 - 02:55:21] dr bur and we'll respond
[02:55:21 - 02:55:23] with the percentages for the
[02:55:23 - 02:55:25] categories um we have been
[02:55:25 - 02:55:25] looking at that data for
[02:55:27 - 02:55:27] example for um parenting students
[02:55:27 - 02:55:29] we have one of the
[02:55:29 - 02:55:32] largest population percentages of parenting
[02:55:32 - 02:55:34] students of um institutions in
[02:55:34 - 02:55:36] the state of texas which
[02:55:36 - 02:55:36] i believe is about 35
[02:55:36 - 02:55:39] of our students um one
[02:55:39 - 02:55:39] of the things about the
[02:55:41 - 02:55:41] strategic marketing plan is these
[02:55:43 - 02:55:43] populations have different needs at
[02:55:45 - 02:55:45] different times for example a
[02:55:45 - 02:55:47] dual credit student who's just
[02:55:47 - 02:55:50] deciding to take dual credit
[02:55:50 - 02:55:53] um is a different marketing
[02:55:53 - 02:55:55] meas um marketing campaign than
[02:55:55 - 02:55:55] a student who's in the
[02:55:55 - 02:55:57] middle of their dual credit
[02:55:57 - 02:55:59] career versus one who is
[02:55:59 - 02:55:59] exiting dual credit and potentially
[02:56:02 - 02:56:02] entering hcc so one of
[02:56:02 - 02:56:04] the things we're doing with
[02:56:04 - 02:56:06] these metrics is connecting this
[02:56:06 - 02:56:08] strategically to the student life
[02:56:08 - 02:56:10] cycle and the strategic plan
[02:56:10 - 02:56:10] our student success plan to
[02:56:10 - 02:56:14] think about how we want
[02:56:14 - 02:56:16] to message those populations as
[02:56:16 - 02:56:20] they move through their hcc
[02:56:20 - 02:56:20] life cycle for entry enrollment
[02:56:23 - 02:56:23] um continued success and then
[02:56:23 - 02:56:27] the next steps um and
[02:56:27 - 02:56:29] so with that so trustee
[02:56:29 - 02:56:29] you provided a lot of
[02:56:32 - 02:56:32] invaluable feedback and that is
[02:56:32 - 02:56:34] in alignment with our findings
[02:56:34 - 02:56:38] and the work that we
[02:56:38 - 02:56:38] have been doing so i
[02:56:38 - 02:56:41] also whenever i search something
[02:56:41 - 02:56:44] southwest college is doing a
[02:56:44 - 02:56:44] good job they pop up
[02:56:47 - 02:56:47] anytime we look for something
[02:56:47 - 02:56:49] um some of the things
[02:56:49 - 02:56:49] so first of all we
[02:56:49 - 02:56:52] have included all our directors
[02:56:52 - 02:56:55] communication directors from the colleges
[02:56:55 - 02:56:58] so we will be uh
[02:56:58 - 02:56:58] picking up the best practices
[02:56:58 - 02:57:02] that are already being um
[02:57:02 - 02:57:06] uh utilized and we will
[02:57:06 - 02:57:06] expand on them on uh
[02:57:06 - 02:57:09] slide six i did mention
[02:57:09 - 02:57:09] in innovation bullet that is
[02:57:12 - 02:57:12] the last bullet how the
[02:57:12 - 02:57:15] tools that are currently available
[02:57:15 - 02:57:18] that will allow us to
[02:57:18 - 02:57:22] really position ourself content generation
[02:57:22 - 02:57:29] ads landing pages video script
[02:57:29 - 02:57:29] all uh very um the
[02:57:29 - 02:57:32] targeted to specific audiences predictive
[02:57:32 - 02:57:35] analytics is no no longer
[02:57:35 - 02:57:35] new so we are going
[02:57:35 - 02:57:40] to be expanding on that
[02:57:40 - 02:57:43] um the retarget website visitors
[02:57:43 - 02:57:46] through pixels so when they
[02:57:46 - 02:57:46] show interest and when they
[02:57:46 - 02:57:50] stop and provide a impression
[02:57:50 - 02:57:52] we we know we will
[02:57:52 - 02:57:52] be able to measure how
[02:57:52 - 02:57:55] many of these students actually
[02:57:55 - 02:57:59] look at our ad and
[02:57:59 - 02:57:59] came to our website um
[02:57:59 - 02:58:02] so those are this is
[02:58:02 - 02:58:06] available on page six page
[02:58:06 - 02:58:06] um 13 talks about different
[02:58:10 - 02:58:10] audiences and i do want
[02:58:10 - 02:58:12] to um say that as
[02:58:12 - 02:58:16] you mentioned our different audience
[02:58:16 - 02:58:18] have different um the the
[02:58:18 - 02:58:18] way of communication and how
[02:58:21 - 02:58:21] they receive information so we
[02:58:21 - 02:58:24] have put down some of
[02:58:24 - 02:58:27] the information here this is

[03:08:37 - 03:08:37] the beginning the texas constitution
[03:08:39 - 03:08:39] allows for four guiding principles
[03:08:39 - 03:08:42] of truth and taxation your
[03:08:42 - 03:08:44] taxpayers have the right to
[03:08:44 - 03:08:46] know about any property value
[03:08:46 - 03:08:49] increases and their estimated taxes
[03:08:49 - 03:08:49] each year taxing units that's
[03:08:51 - 03:08:51] you guys have the obligation
[03:08:52 - 03:08:54] to calculate and publish your
[03:08:54 - 03:08:57] tax rates before you adopt
[03:08:57 - 03:09:00] them otherwise the tax payer
[03:09:00 - 03:09:00] can file an injunction and
[03:09:03 - 03:09:03] stop the rate process taxing
[03:09:03 - 03:09:06] units also have the obligation
[03:09:06 - 03:09:08] to publish notices and hold
[03:09:08 - 03:09:11] hearings regarding the increases otherwise
[03:09:11 - 03:09:13] taxpayers can file a different
[03:09:13 - 03:09:15] injunction to stop the process
[03:09:15 - 03:09:15] this is all about giving
[03:09:17 - 03:09:17] taxpayers the information that they
[03:09:17 - 03:09:19] need to be a part
[03:09:19 - 03:09:19] of the process voters have
[03:09:22 - 03:09:22] the right to roll back
[03:09:22 - 03:09:24] the rate if it goes
[03:09:24 - 03:09:24] above certain levels which we'll
[03:09:26 - 03:09:28] talk about shortly so the
[03:09:28 - 03:09:28] six steps for truth and
[03:09:30 - 03:09:30] taxation first you should draft
[03:09:30 - 03:09:32] your budget next we'll calculate
[03:09:32 - 03:09:35] our benchmark tax rates that
[03:09:35 - 03:09:37] includes the no new revenue
[03:09:37 - 03:09:40] rate and the voter approval
[03:09:40 - 03:09:40] rate after that we publish
[03:09:42 - 03:09:42] our notices and put information
[03:09:42 - 03:09:45] on the website so that
[03:09:45 - 03:09:47] the taxpayers can become involved
[03:09:47 - 03:09:47] in the process we will
[03:09:47 - 03:09:49] hold hearings so that the
[03:09:49 - 03:09:51] taxpayers have a voice in
[03:09:51 - 03:09:51] the process you're going to
[03:09:55 - 03:09:55] adopt your tax rate by
[03:09:55 - 03:09:57] the deadline and if required
[03:09:57 - 03:09:57] you will hold an election
[03:10:00 - 03:10:00] which will most likely not
[03:10:00 - 03:10:02] happen so i just talked
[03:10:02 - 03:10:04] to you about you're going
[03:10:04 - 03:10:04] to calculate your benchmark tax
[03:10:06 - 03:10:06] rates what are your benchmark
[03:10:06 - 03:10:08] tax rates first you have
[03:10:08 - 03:10:11] your no new revenue tax
[03:10:11 - 03:10:11] rate that is the rate
[03:10:11 - 03:10:13] what that will bring in
[03:10:13 - 03:10:15] approximately the same amount of
[03:10:15 - 03:10:15] money as last year we're
[03:10:17 - 03:10:17] trying to compare apples to
[03:10:17 - 03:10:20] apples here so it we
[03:10:20 - 03:10:20] exclude any new improvements on
[03:10:22 - 03:10:22] the role so that we
[03:10:22 - 03:10:22] can have an idea of
[03:10:25 - 03:10:25] last year versus this year
[03:10:25 - 03:10:28] we also calculate the voter
[03:10:28 - 03:10:30] approval tax rate that brings
[03:10:30 - 03:10:30] in the same revenue as
[03:10:30 - 03:10:33] last year but it gives
[03:10:33 - 03:10:36] a small increase to account
[03:10:36 - 03:10:39] for inflation so you guys
[03:10:39 - 03:10:39] are a technically a special
[03:10:41 - 03:10:41] taxing unit you are a
[03:10:41 - 03:10:43] junior college district that means
[03:10:43 - 03:10:43] that by law you are
[03:10:46 - 03:10:46] special that means that you
[03:10:46 - 03:10:49] are allowed to have up
[03:10:49 - 03:10:49] to 8 growth for your
[03:10:49 - 03:10:51] voter approval tax rate if
[03:10:51 - 03:10:53] you go above that rate
[03:10:53 - 03:10:53] you are automatically going to
[03:10:55 - 03:10:55] have an election in november
[03:10:55 - 03:10:57] so we try to stay
[03:10:57 - 03:10:57] below that voter approval rate
[03:11:00 - 03:11:00] each year if you have
[03:11:00 - 03:11:03] to go above that rate
[03:11:03 - 03:11:03] in response to a disaster
[03:11:03 - 03:11:05] you can however this is
[03:11:05 - 03:11:05] the last year that you
[03:11:07 - 03:11:07] will actually have that ability
[03:11:07 - 03:11:09] after 2025 that ability is
[03:11:09 - 03:11:12] going to go away and
[03:11:12 - 03:11:12] you will be limited at
[03:11:12 - 03:11:14] that 8 rate just wanted
[03:11:14 - 03:11:14] to make sure that you
[03:11:14 - 03:11:17] knew about this change for
[03:11:17 - 03:11:20] next year say that again
[03:11:20 - 03:11:21] say that again so so
[03:11:25 - 03:11:25] in the future this year
[03:11:25 - 03:11:27] this year if you need
[03:11:27 - 03:11:27] to go above that 8
[03:11:27 - 03:11:29] in response to a disaster
[03:11:29 - 03:11:32] in response to a hurricane
[03:11:32 - 03:11:32] that hits you can technically
[03:11:34 - 03:11:34] go above this year in
[03:11:34 - 03:11:36] response to a disaster in
[03:11:36 - 03:11:36] future years you will no
[03:11:39 - 03:11:39] longer have that ability so
[03:11:39 - 03:11:41] you almost never go above
[03:11:41 - 03:11:41] 8 you are very um
[03:11:42 - 03:11:42] conservative on that and that's
[03:11:44 - 03:11:44] wonderful but i needed to
[03:11:44 - 03:11:48] at least let you know
[03:11:48 - 03:11:48] that it is a change
[03:11:48 - 03:11:50] in the law your debt
[03:11:50 - 03:11:50] you get as much money
[03:11:50 - 03:11:52] as you need in order
[03:11:52 - 03:11:52] to pay your debt because
[03:11:54 - 03:11:54] it's already been approved by
[03:11:54 - 03:11:56] voters in your bond elections
[03:11:56 - 03:11:58] so the collector is going
[03:11:58 - 03:11:58] to certify to you guys
[03:11:58 - 03:12:01] your anticipated collection rate your
[03:12:02 - 03:12:02] anticipated collection rate cannot be
[03:12:04 - 03:12:04] lower than the actual collection
[03:12:04 - 03:12:07] rate for the past 3
[03:12:07 - 03:12:07] years but it can be
[03:12:09 - 03:12:09] greater than 100 for the
[03:12:09 - 03:12:12] purposes of tnt if um
[03:12:12 - 03:12:14] depending on how collections go
[03:12:14 - 03:12:16] that year so before you're
[03:12:16 - 03:12:18] hearing with the public where
[03:12:18 - 03:12:18] you're going to adopt the
[03:12:18 - 03:12:20] tax rate you have to
[03:12:20 - 03:12:22] certify the tnt worksheets the
[03:12:22 - 03:12:22] first of step of that
[03:12:22 - 03:12:24] is going to be designating
[03:12:24 - 03:12:27] your doe your designated officer
[03:12:27 - 03:12:28] or employee um they are
[03:12:28 - 03:12:28] going to be responsible for
[03:12:31 - 03:12:31] calculating the worksheets i suggest
[03:12:34 - 03:12:34] designating two people if some
[03:12:34 - 03:12:35] person is sick if the
[03:12:35 - 03:12:36] person is in a car
[03:12:37 - 03:12:37] accident if they leave halfway
[03:12:37 - 03:12:39] through the year for some
[03:12:39 - 03:12:41] reason it's always good to
[03:12:41 - 03:12:41] have a backup dough so
[03:12:41 - 03:12:44] just in case always keep
[03:12:44 - 03:12:46] that in mind they will
[03:12:46 - 03:12:46] um calculate the tax rates
[03:12:46 - 03:12:48] and then they will submit
[03:12:48 - 03:12:48] the no new revenue rate
[03:12:50 - 03:12:50] and the vote approval rate
[03:12:50 - 03:12:52] to you guys so you
[03:12:52 - 03:12:52] know what numbers you're working
[03:12:54 - 03:12:54] with this year then we
[03:12:54 - 03:12:57] can adopt the tax rates
[03:12:57 - 03:12:57] you're also going to update
[03:12:59 - 03:12:59] the chief appraisers database as
[03:12:59 - 03:13:01] your information becomes available you
[03:13:01 - 03:13:03] may not hold a public
[03:13:03 - 03:13:06] hearing or adopt your rate
[03:13:06 - 03:13:06] until at least 5 days
[03:13:06 - 03:13:08] after the chief appraiser has
[03:13:08 - 03:13:11] delivered a postcard for estimated
[03:13:11 - 03:13:15] taxes and all your information
[03:13:15 - 03:13:15] is updated on their website
[03:13:17 - 03:13:17] so this is what the
[03:13:17 - 03:13:18] august cad notice is going
[03:13:18 - 03:13:18] to look like the chief
[03:13:18 - 03:13:20] appraiser is already posting it
[03:13:20 - 03:13:22] everywhere this is part of
[03:13:22 - 03:13:25] the process where the taxpayers
[03:13:25 - 03:13:29] can have information on what
[03:13:29 - 03:13:29] is going on with their
[03:13:29 - 03:13:31] taxes you'll see that on
[03:13:31 - 03:13:33] the chief appraisers website they're
[03:13:33 - 03:13:33] going to put when and
[03:13:35 - 03:13:35] where you're going to have
[03:13:35 - 03:13:37] your hearing they're going to
[03:13:37 - 03:13:37] show the no new revenue
[03:13:38 - 03:13:38] rate the vote approval rate
[03:13:38 - 03:13:40] the proposed rate and then
[03:13:40 - 03:13:43] each and every person in
[03:13:43 - 03:13:43] your taxing unit can type
[03:13:43 - 03:13:45] in their address and see
[03:13:45 - 03:13:46] what their estimated taxes would
[03:13:46 - 03:13:46] be at the no new
[03:13:49 - 03:13:49] revenue rate versus at the
[03:13:49 - 03:13:50] rate that you're proposing so
[03:13:50 - 03:13:52] it gets them involved they
[03:13:52 - 03:13:55] can see exactly what you're
[03:13:55 - 03:13:55] doing with their taxes so
[03:13:55 - 03:13:58] before you adopt the rate
[03:13:58 - 03:14:00] you have to have either
[03:14:00 - 03:14:00] a public hearing or a
[03:14:00 - 03:14:02] public meeting it's going to
[03:14:02 - 03:14:03] depend on what rate you
[03:14:03 - 03:14:03] adopt which you're going to
[03:14:06 - 03:14:06] have you'll publish your 2606
[03:14:06 - 03:14:09] public hearing notice if you're
[03:14:09 - 03:14:11] adopting above the no new
[03:14:11 - 03:14:11] revenue rate or the voter
[03:14:13 - 03:14:13] approval rate otherwise you'll just
[03:14:14 - 03:14:14] schedule a meeting to adopt
[03:14:14 - 03:14:17] the tax rate you must
[03:14:17 - 03:14:17] publish the notice in the
[03:14:19 - 03:14:19] newspaper at least 5 days
[03:14:19 - 03:14:21] before you have your meeting
[03:14:21 - 03:14:23] um the wording depends on
[03:14:23 - 03:14:23] what your proposed rate is
[03:14:25 - 03:14:25] versus your no new revenue
[03:14:25 - 03:14:26] rate your finance department will
[03:14:26 - 03:14:30] take care of all of
[03:14:30 - 03:14:30] that for you if you
[03:14:30 - 03:14:33] do not adopt at that
[03:14:33 - 03:14:33] meeting you have to adopt
[03:14:33 - 03:14:35] within 7 days of that
[03:14:35 - 03:14:38] public hearing so you'll adopt
[03:14:38 - 03:14:38] you'll announce the date time
[03:14:40 - 03:14:40] and place of the second
[03:14:40 - 03:14:43] hearing at the first one
[03:14:43 - 03:14:43] now just a second bit
[03:14:43 - 03:14:45] of information i'm pointing out
[03:14:45 - 03:14:47] because it's a change in
[03:14:47 - 03:14:47] the law so we have
[03:14:47 - 03:14:49] a 72-hour notice for this
[03:14:49 - 03:14:51] tax rate adoption meeting our
[03:14:51 - 03:14:54] open meetings act notice as
[03:14:54 - 03:14:54] of september 1st that becomes
[03:14:57 - 03:14:57] three business days so i'm
[03:14:57 - 03:14:59] you're probably all aware that
[03:14:59 - 03:15:02] your 72-hour notices now become
[03:15:02 - 03:15:04] three business days wonderful so
[03:15:04 - 03:15:04] um you are going to
[03:15:04 - 03:15:07] have to adopt your tax
[03:15:07 - 03:15:10] rate by september 30th or
[03:15:10 - 03:15:10] 60 days after ro certification
[03:15:10 - 03:15:12] you guys always work with
[03:15:12 - 03:15:15] 60 days after ro certification
[03:15:15 - 03:15:16] because um harris county tax
[03:15:16 - 03:15:16] office always certifies a little
[03:15:16 - 03:15:19] bit late if you're going
[03:15:19 - 03:15:20] to go above the voter
[03:15:20 - 03:15:20] approval tax rate which you're
[03:15:22 - 03:15:22] not you have earlier deadlines
[03:15:22 - 03:15:24] to work with in august
[03:15:24 - 03:15:26] you don't have any intention
[03:15:26 - 03:15:26] about going above your vote
[03:15:28 - 03:15:28] approval rate so we'll skip
[03:15:28 - 03:15:31] so you will have a
[03:15:31 - 03:15:31] separate vote on the budget
[03:15:34 - 03:15:34] and on the tax rate
[03:15:34 - 03:15:36] if your proposed tax rate
[03:15:36 - 03:15:36] exceeds your no new revenue
[03:15:38 - 03:15:38] rate one of those benchmark
[03:15:38 - 03:15:40] rates that udo just calculated
[03:15:40 - 03:15:42] for you you'll have a
[03:15:42 - 03:15:42] record vote you have to
[03:15:42 - 03:15:45] have a voting threshold of
[03:15:45 - 03:15:45] 60 if you go above
[03:15:45 - 03:15:47] that no new revenue rate
[03:15:47 - 03:15:49] and then you'll have specific
[03:15:49 - 03:15:51] motion language and language that's
[03:15:51 - 03:15:51] going to go on your
[03:15:51 - 03:15:53] website other things that go
[03:15:53 - 03:15:55] on your website are all
[03:15:55 - 03:15:55] included here part of the
[03:15:55 - 03:15:57] process of allowing the taxpayers
[03:15:57 - 03:16:00] to get in contact with
[03:16:00 - 03:16:00] you and have a say
[03:16:00 - 03:16:02] on they can voice their
[03:16:02 - 03:16:04] opinions on that cad database
[03:16:04 - 03:16:04] there's a section there for
[03:16:06 - 03:16:06] people to make comments but
[03:16:06 - 03:16:08] also on your website you'll
[03:16:08 - 03:16:10] have the taxing unit's mailing
[03:16:10 - 03:16:13] address email and telephone number
[03:16:13 - 03:16:13] along with the name and
[03:16:15 - 03:16:15] contact information for each member
[03:16:15 - 03:16:16] of the governing body you'll
[03:16:16 - 03:16:18] have the budget for the
[03:16:18 - 03:16:21] past two years along along
[03:16:21 - 03:16:21] with the percent and dollar
[03:16:21 - 03:16:23] change in your budgets and
[03:16:23 - 03:16:25] you'll have the tax rates
[03:16:25 - 03:16:25] for the last two years
[03:16:25 - 03:16:28] broken down by your m
[03:16:28 - 03:16:28] and your debt rate you'll
[03:16:29 - 03:16:29] also be publishing your most
[03:16:29 - 03:16:32] recent financial audit on your
[03:16:32 - 03:16:34] website all about transparency guys
[03:16:34 - 03:16:36] we want to make sure
[03:16:36 - 03:16:36] everything is up to date
[03:16:38 - 03:16:38] other website requirements are will
[03:16:38 - 03:16:41] have on the tax assessor's
[03:16:41 - 03:16:43] website they are responsible for
[03:16:43 - 03:16:45] having the last five years
[03:16:45 - 03:16:45] history of all your tax
[03:16:45 - 03:16:47] rates your adopted rate your
[03:16:47 - 03:16:49] m rate your debt rate
[03:16:49 - 03:16:49] your no new revenue rate
[03:16:51 - 03:16:51] your vote approval rate so
[03:16:51 - 03:16:53] we can go back and
[03:16:53 - 03:16:53] see they also will have
[03:16:53 - 03:16:56] five years of those truth
[03:16:56 - 03:16:58] and taxation forms all 80
[03:16:58 - 03:16:58] lines of the calculations will
[03:16:58 - 03:17:03] be on that website starting
[03:17:03 - 03:17:04] next year those forms will
[03:17:04 - 03:17:06] actually have all the backup
[03:17:06 - 03:17:06] information as well as a
[03:17:09 - 03:17:09] hyperlink so each member of
[03:17:09 - 03:17:11] the public anywhere they are
[03:17:11 - 03:17:12] they'll be able to click
[03:17:12 - 03:17:12] on your truth and taxation
[03:17:14 - 03:17:14] worksheets and they will be
[03:17:14 - 03:17:16] able to see line for
[03:17:16 - 03:17:16] line where each number came
[03:17:18 - 03:17:18] from where you pulled those
[03:17:18 - 03:17:21] reports so it's going to
[03:17:21 - 03:17:23] be very clear to everybody
[03:17:23 - 03:17:23] exactly how we did our
[03:17:26 - 03:17:26] calculations as of next year
[03:17:29 - 03:17:29] so if we look at
[03:17:29 - 03:17:32] the tnt 2025 calendar we're
[03:17:32 - 03:17:32] already in august so your
[03:17:34 - 03:17:34] collector has likely already certified
[03:17:36 - 03:17:36] your anticipated collection rate and
[03:17:36 - 03:17:38] any excess collections from last
[03:17:38 - 03:17:40] year so if you collected
[03:17:40 - 03:17:40] too much in debt last
[03:17:42 - 03:17:42] year you have to give
[03:17:42 - 03:17:44] that money back this year
[03:17:44 - 03:17:44] in the form of a
[03:17:44 - 03:17:46] lower debt rate so we
[03:17:46 - 03:17:46] try to make sure that
[03:17:46 - 03:17:48] our debt calculations are fairly
[03:17:48 - 03:17:50] accurate you need enough money
[03:17:50 - 03:17:51] to you need to collect
[03:17:51 - 03:17:51] enough to pay your debt
[03:17:51 - 03:17:53] but if you collect too
[03:17:53 - 03:17:53] much it goes back to
[03:17:54 - 03:17:54] the taxpayers next year it's
[03:17:54 - 03:17:57] actually really wonderful in that
[03:17:57 - 03:17:59] way so by august 7th
[03:17:59 - 03:17:59] or as soon as practicable
[03:18:01 - 03:18:01] your doe is going to
[03:18:01 - 03:18:03] submit the rates to you
[03:18:03 - 03:18:03] the county tax is going
[03:18:03 - 03:18:05] to post the tnt forms
[03:18:05 - 03:18:05] on the website and the
[03:18:05 - 03:18:07] chief appraiser is going to
[03:18:07 - 03:18:09] publish um the notice of
[03:18:09 - 03:18:12] estimated taxes so everyone can
[03:18:12 - 03:18:12] type in their own property
[03:18:12 - 03:18:15] and see exactly what their
[03:18:15 - 03:18:17] estimated taxes are we have
[03:18:17 - 03:18:17] the deadlines for the going
[03:18:19 - 03:18:19] above the voter approval rate
[03:18:19 - 03:18:21] which we're like going to
[03:18:21 - 03:18:23] skip because you're not going
[03:18:23 - 03:18:26] above your voter approval rate
[03:18:26 - 03:18:26] um and then by august
[03:18:26 - 03:18:28] october 1st the tax assessor
[03:18:28 - 03:18:30] will prepare and mail the
[03:18:30 - 03:18:30] bills and that november 5th
[03:18:30 - 03:18:33] is the uniform election date
[03:18:33 - 03:18:35] now do you have any
[03:18:35 - 03:18:37] questions one thing i did
[03:18:37 - 03:18:37] want to point out just
[03:18:40 - 03:18:40] it's not in the slide
[03:18:40 - 03:18:43] um the texas legislature has
[03:18:43 - 03:18:46] reconvened for a special session
[03:18:46 - 03:18:46] they are focusing on truth
[03:18:46 - 03:18:48] and taxation a little bit
[03:18:48 - 03:18:51] so they have some legislature
[03:18:51 - 03:18:51] that could be changing the
[03:18:53 - 03:18:53] tnt process at the moment
[03:18:53 - 03:18:55] they are leaving you guys
[03:18:55 - 03:18:57] alone they are focusing on
[03:18:57 - 03:18:57] cities and counties and um
[03:19:00 - 03:19:00] reducing their voter approval rates
[03:19:00 - 03:19:01] to two and a half
[03:19:01 - 03:19:04] percent you guys have 8
[03:19:04 - 03:19:04] so at the moment they're
[03:19:04 - 03:19:06] leaving you alone but it's
[03:19:06 - 03:19:06] something to be aware of
[03:19:08 - 03:19:08] that you might have some
[03:19:08 - 03:19:08] changes in the that you
[03:19:08 - 03:19:09] might have some changes in
[03:19:10 - 03:19:14] the future future thank you
[03:19:14 - 03:19:18] trustes any questions what is

[03:22:19 - 03:22:22] answer all questions thank you
[03:22:22 - 03:22:22] again so what we've provided
[03:22:24 - 03:22:24] here is basically a summary
[03:22:24 - 03:22:25] of the county timeline which
[03:22:25 - 03:22:28] you've heard something about in
[03:22:28 - 03:22:30] greater detail by linear we
[03:22:30 - 03:22:30] just laid out what they
[03:22:30 - 03:22:33] do what the counties both
[03:22:33 - 03:22:36] counties do on a month-to-month
[03:22:36 - 03:22:36] basis and then our month-to-month
[03:22:36 - 03:22:38] basis and then our followup
[03:22:38 - 03:22:41] followup is our proposed tax
[03:22:41 - 03:22:43] rate and revenue these are
[03:22:43 - 03:22:45] very preliminary estimates they were
[03:22:45 - 03:22:45] these were based on april
[03:22:45 - 03:22:47] 30th data because we won't
[03:22:47 - 03:22:51] have property valuations until mid
[03:22:51 - 03:22:53] to late august we are
[03:22:53 - 03:22:53] hoping by august 18th but
[03:22:53 - 03:22:56] more likely august 25th and
[03:22:56 - 03:22:58] that sort of falls outside
[03:22:58 - 03:22:58] of the board meeting dates
[03:23:00 - 03:23:00] that we could get anything
[03:23:00 - 03:23:03] to you by so we're
[03:23:03 - 03:23:03] hoping to get a revised
[03:23:04 - 03:23:04] version of the tax rate
[03:23:04 - 03:23:07] to you and possibilities by
[03:23:07 - 03:23:09] the the september 3rd meeting
[03:23:09 - 03:23:09] that'll give us enough enough
[03:23:11 - 03:23:11] time to do calculations based
[03:23:11 - 03:23:13] on what we receive because
[03:23:13 - 03:23:13] a lot of this is
[03:23:13 - 03:23:15] based on what the property
[03:23:15 - 03:23:18] values are we had proposed
[03:23:18 - 03:23:18] uh a tax rate increase
[03:23:18 - 03:23:22] you may recall of i
[03:23:22 - 03:23:22] think 3 5 in the
[03:23:22 - 03:23:24] fy26 budget to give us
[03:23:24 - 03:23:27] enough cash to operate and
[03:23:27 - 03:23:27] do what we plan to
[03:23:27 - 03:23:30] do program-wise um and that
[03:23:30 - 03:23:30] was predicated on a 2
[03:23:30 - 03:23:33] 2 roughly uh property value
[03:23:33 - 03:23:35] increase over the year but
[03:23:35 - 03:23:35] that was an estimate so
[03:23:37 - 03:23:37] we are kind of waiting
[03:23:37 - 03:23:40] for the real data to
[03:23:40 - 03:23:40] come in mid to late
[03:23:40 - 03:23:42] august that will determine the
[03:23:42 - 03:23:46] rest however we have done
[03:23:46 - 03:23:46] a couple of option calculations
[03:23:46 - 03:23:48] on in case our revenue
[03:23:48 - 03:23:50] is better than we anticipated
[03:23:50 - 03:23:50] when we worked through the
[03:23:52 - 03:23:52] budget we had a lot
[03:23:52 - 03:23:53] of sturm and drang during
[03:23:53 - 03:23:54] the budget discussions about what
[03:23:55 - 03:23:55] if this what if that
[03:23:55 - 03:23:57] because there was so much
[03:23:57 - 03:23:57] unknown if it turns out
[03:23:57 - 03:23:59] that we're doing a lot
[03:23:59 - 03:24:01] better enrollment wise and therefore
[03:24:01 - 03:24:03] revenue-wise than we thought we
[03:24:03 - 03:24:03] have a couple of scenarios
[03:24:05 - 03:24:05] that we'll be proposing to
[03:24:05 - 03:24:10] talk about with decreased tax
[03:24:10 - 03:24:12] increases in total so we've
[03:24:12 - 03:24:12] taken a look at that
[03:24:12 - 03:24:13] and we will continue to
[03:24:13 - 03:24:13] look at that it's a
[03:24:15 - 03:24:15] little iffy to come up
[03:24:15 - 03:24:17] with something definitive at this
[03:24:17 - 03:24:20] point it's too early in
[03:24:20 - 03:24:20] the academic year cycle to
[03:24:20 - 03:24:21] know what revenue might be
[03:24:21 - 03:24:21] we just kind of took
[03:24:21 - 03:24:23] a swing at it here
[03:24:23 - 03:24:25] and included some analysis of
[03:24:25 - 03:24:27] international student enrollment as well
[03:24:27 - 03:24:29] just to give you some
[03:24:29 - 03:24:30] context but timing wise we're
[03:24:32 - 03:24:32] kind of not ready it's
[03:24:32 - 03:24:34] not ready yet to propose
[03:24:34 - 03:24:34] new tax rates but we're
[03:24:34 - 03:24:36] working on it we're working
[03:24:36 - 03:24:43] on whatever data we and
[03:24:43 - 03:24:43] again our our purpose was
[03:24:43 - 03:24:45] to ensuring that making sure
[03:24:45 - 03:24:46] that we could do what
[03:24:46 - 03:24:46] we say we're going to
[03:24:46 - 03:24:49] do programwise and marketing wise
[03:24:52 - 03:24:54] continuing sustainability of operations um
[03:24:54 - 03:24:54] and addressing our the priorities
[03:24:56 - 03:24:56] that are proposed and come
[03:24:56 - 03:24:59] up out of the strategic
[03:24:59 - 03:25:01] planning process we're also just
[03:25:01 - 03:25:01] as a kind of a
[03:25:01 - 03:25:05] sidebar looking at at a
[03:25:05 - 03:25:05] um an advancement in the
[03:25:05 - 03:25:08] timing of a total budget
[03:25:08 - 03:25:08] for fy27 so we can
[03:25:08 - 03:25:10] get over the issue of
[03:25:10 - 03:25:12] having you see just slices
[03:25:12 - 03:25:12] of it at a time
[03:25:12 - 03:25:15] and an inability to see
[03:25:15 - 03:25:15] the whole picture but that
[03:25:15 - 03:25:16] will require having information sooner
[03:25:19 - 03:25:19] working across the district earlier
[03:25:19 - 03:25:22] to gather that input so
[03:25:22 - 03:25:23] we can propose something we
[03:25:23 - 03:25:23] can get your feedback and
[03:25:25 - 03:25:25] continue to kind of fine-tune
[03:25:25 - 03:25:27] the budget earlier in the
[03:25:27 - 03:25:31] cycle still planning for a
[03:25:31 - 03:25:31] june 2026 approval of the
[03:25:31 - 03:25:33] fy27 budget but we'll be
[03:25:33 - 03:25:35] much more prepared much sooner
[03:25:35 - 03:25:35] with a whole package for
[03:25:35 - 03:25:39] you this is a piece
[03:25:39 - 03:25:40] of it of course any
[03:25:40 - 03:25:42] questions at all yes she
[03:25:44 - 03:25:44] yeah i i appreciate you
[03:25:44 - 03:25:46] bringing up um the the
[03:25:46 - 03:25:46] calibration we'll need to do
[03:25:47 - 03:25:47] with our other revenue streams
[03:25:47 - 03:25:49] and how that impacts the
[03:25:49 - 03:25:51] tax rate uh i'm curious
[03:25:51 - 03:25:51] and i know that you
[03:25:51 - 03:25:52] know too early in the
[03:25:52 - 03:25:55] process to share firm numbers
[03:25:55 - 03:25:55] in terms of dollars and
[03:25:55 - 03:25:57] cents um but could you
[03:25:57 - 03:25:57] anchor us a bit on
[03:25:59 - 03:25:59] what we're seeing in terms
[03:25:59 - 03:26:00] of enrollment and how that
[03:26:00 - 03:26:00] compares to some of the
[03:26:02 - 03:26:02] assumptions that we made in
[03:26:02 - 03:26:03] the budgeting process so for
[03:26:03 - 03:26:05] example i think where we
[03:26:05 - 03:26:07] landed for international student enrollment
[03:26:07 - 03:26:07] was either a 25 or
[03:26:07 - 03:26:10] a 50 reduction as a
[03:26:10 - 03:26:12] budgeting assumption be curious to
[03:26:12 - 03:26:14] understand how that's starting to
[03:26:14 - 03:26:14] show up in the data
[03:26:14 - 03:26:15] now just so we can
[03:26:15 - 03:26:15] calibrate kind of the the
[03:26:17 - 03:26:17] magnitude of the shifts versus
[03:26:17 - 03:26:19] our budgeting assumptions that we
[03:26:19 - 03:26:22] can be expecting actually if
[03:26:22 - 03:26:23] if i have that information
[03:26:23 - 03:26:25] it's part of another presentation
[03:26:25 - 03:26:27] on connect to workforce so
[03:26:27 - 03:26:27] just give me one minute
[03:26:27 - 03:26:31] i'll be right back dr
[03:26:31 - 03:26:31] buridge also has some of
[03:26:32 - 03:26:35] that information as well um
[03:26:42 - 03:26:42] so we did take a
[03:26:42 - 03:26:42] look at what we've seen
[03:26:46 - 03:26:46] as international segment growth as
[03:26:47 - 03:26:52] international segment growth um it
[03:26:52 - 03:26:52] may be a little premature
[03:26:52 - 03:26:54] again to quantify that precisely
[03:26:54 - 03:26:55] because we're comparing it and
[03:26:55 - 03:26:55] i'm going to let dr
[03:26:57 - 03:26:57] bird speak as well it
[03:26:57 - 03:26:59] we're comparing it to last
[03:26:59 - 03:26:59] year when we might have
[03:26:59 - 03:27:01] seen a drop that was
[03:27:01 - 03:27:03] artificial an artificial drop based
[03:27:03 - 03:27:05] on climate conditions of the
[03:27:05 - 03:27:05] time so it may look
[03:27:07 - 03:27:07] like we've had a a
[03:27:07 - 03:27:09] giant leap i don't want
[03:27:09 - 03:27:09] to base our revenue on
[03:27:09 - 03:27:16] that false and we've been
[03:27:16 - 03:27:17] working with our international students
[03:27:17 - 03:27:19] office and looking at national
[03:27:19 - 03:27:21] data nationally international student enrollment
[03:27:21 - 03:27:24] is projected to be down
[03:27:24 - 03:27:26] about 20 um looking at
[03:27:26 - 03:27:28] our preliminary numbers we do
[03:27:28 - 03:27:28] think we're going to do
[03:27:28 - 03:27:32] a little bit better than
[03:27:32 - 03:27:32] that maybe 5 to 10
[03:27:32 - 03:27:34] down um we think that
[03:27:34 - 03:27:37] students enrolled earlier this year
[03:27:37 - 03:27:37] than last year so we
[03:27:39 - 03:27:39] we're actually up day over
[03:27:40 - 03:27:40] year-over-year but remember last year
[03:27:42 - 03:27:42] we had barrel and so
[03:27:42 - 03:27:45] enrollment was very late and
[03:27:45 - 03:27:45] we also had uh more
[03:27:45 - 03:27:47] late international um student orientations
[03:27:50 - 03:27:50] which is why we're um
[03:27:50 - 03:27:56] conservatively projecting at 5 to
[03:27:56 - 03:27:57] 10 down right now that's
[03:27:57 - 03:27:59] helpful on the international front
[03:27:59 - 03:27:59] but i know student enrollment
[03:27:59 - 03:28:01] also was you know generally
[03:28:01 - 03:28:03] projected to be flatish so
[03:28:03 - 03:28:03] are we are we seeing
[03:28:03 - 03:28:05] that as well are we
[03:28:05 - 03:28:06] looking up down just curious
[03:28:06 - 03:28:08] for early indications early indications
[03:28:08 - 03:28:10] are we doing really well
[03:28:10 - 03:28:10] for enrollment we have a
[03:28:10 - 03:28:12] couple of factors we were
[03:28:12 - 03:28:17] concerned about for example pel
[03:28:17 - 03:28:17] that um that the as
[03:28:17 - 03:28:20] you know um the big
[03:28:20 - 03:28:22] beautiful bill did not pass
[03:28:22 - 03:28:22] with those massive pel decreases
[03:28:25 - 03:28:25] and so that that um
[03:28:25 - 03:28:28] accounted for the change in
[03:28:28 - 03:28:28] that p projection um there
[03:28:31 - 03:28:31] still are some changes to
[03:28:31 - 03:28:35] some of our students that
[03:28:35 - 03:28:35] we can't model yet because
[03:28:37 - 03:28:37] in the next two weeks
[03:28:37 - 03:28:38] are when we're really going
[03:28:38 - 03:28:38] to see the impact of
[03:28:38 - 03:28:41] the students but right now
[03:28:41 - 03:28:44] we're up in all student
[03:28:44 - 03:28:44] demographics by quite a bit
[03:28:45 - 03:28:45] all right thank you for
[03:28:45 - 03:28:46] that thank you so much

[04:00:18 - 04:00:18] alternate plan for a reduction
[04:00:18 - 04:00:21] in tech fees that would
[04:00:21 - 04:00:25] support students financial ability to
[04:00:25 - 04:00:26] enroll at hcc the plan
[04:00:26 - 04:00:26] that is brought forward for
[04:00:29 - 04:00:29] your consideration of approval is
[04:00:29 - 04:00:32] called connect to and with
[04:00:32 - 04:00:34] your permission madame chair our
[04:00:34 - 04:00:37] two senior vice chancellors will
[04:00:37 - 04:00:38] present the proposal provide an
[04:00:38 - 04:00:41] overview and answer questions thank
[04:00:41 - 04:00:41] you dr perez and dr
[04:00:41 - 04:00:42] questions thank you dr perez
[04:00:42 - 04:00:45] and dr han han thank
[04:00:45 - 04:00:45] you chancellor madam chair and
[04:00:45 - 04:00:46] thank you chancellor madam chair
[04:00:46 - 04:00:50] and trustees trustees you we
[04:00:50 - 04:00:50] while we appreciate the uh
[04:00:50 - 04:00:52] the um the approval of
[04:00:52 - 04:00:55] the funds for houston reconnect
[04:00:55 - 04:00:55] we also feel that there's
[04:00:55 - 04:00:59] a a a a group
[04:00:59 - 04:00:59] of students that that also
[04:01:00 - 04:01:03] could benefit from financial assistance
[04:01:03 - 04:01:05] so that's the idea of
[04:01:05 - 04:01:07] connect 2 came about in
[04:01:07 - 04:01:09] the discussion regarding enrollment and
[04:01:09 - 04:01:09] retention and how to address
[04:01:09 - 04:01:11] the challenges our students face
[04:01:11 - 04:01:13] that are financial that may
[04:01:13 - 04:01:16] impede them from completing their
[04:01:16 - 04:01:19] educational goals so connect two
[04:01:19 - 04:01:20] would provide financial support to
[04:01:20 - 04:01:22] students that are working towards
[04:01:22 - 04:01:25] an industry recognized credential or
[04:01:25 - 04:01:26] a selected workforce credential or
[04:01:26 - 04:01:28] a selected workforce program program
[04:01:29 - 04:01:29] uh whether it's a continuing
[04:01:30 - 04:01:32] education short-term training program program
[04:01:32 - 04:01:33] or whether it's a workforce
[04:01:33 - 04:01:35] level one or level two
[04:01:36 - 04:01:38] certificate or even an occupational
[04:01:38 - 04:01:39] skills or even an occupational
[04:01:39 - 04:01:43] skills certificate certificate we've identified
[04:01:43 - 04:01:46] five high demand areas that
[04:01:46 - 04:01:48] we believe that uh would
[04:01:48 - 04:01:48] definitely assist our students and
[04:01:50 - 04:01:50] those areas are digital information
[04:01:53 - 04:01:56] technology spark manufacturing transportation health
[04:01:56 - 04:01:57] sciences and transportation health sciences
[04:01:58 - 04:02:01] and construction construction these students
[04:02:01 - 04:02:06] could be students from uh
[04:02:06 - 04:02:08] seeking to upskill uh these
[04:02:08 - 04:02:08] could also be dual credit
[04:02:10 - 04:02:10] students that started with us
[04:02:10 - 04:02:11] uh and graduated this past
[04:02:11 - 04:02:15] year and didn't complete their
[04:02:15 - 04:02:17] certificate um and we would
[04:02:17 - 04:02:17] like to get them back
[04:02:17 - 04:02:18] at hcc or they could
[04:02:18 - 04:02:18] also be students that are
[04:02:21 - 04:02:21] seeking those short-term uh continuing
[04:02:24 - 04:02:24] education training courses that are
[04:02:27 - 04:02:27] currently not covered by financial
[04:02:27 - 04:02:30] aid uh if you recall
[04:02:30 - 04:02:30] under the new uh uh
[04:02:32 - 04:02:32] legislation that was passed uh
[04:02:32 - 04:02:35] the federal uh the our
[04:02:35 - 04:02:38] our us congress passed the
[04:02:38 - 04:02:42] federal legislation regarding federal financial
[04:02:42 - 04:02:46] aid for 2627 that's going
[04:02:46 - 04:02:46] to start covering the uh
[04:02:47 - 04:02:49] continuing education short-term training program
[04:02:49 - 04:02:49] financial aid but that would
[04:02:50 - 04:02:54] not be implemented until uh
[04:02:54 - 04:02:59] 2627 i'm sorry 272 uh
[04:02:59 - 04:03:01] 28 eight if if 2627
[04:03:01 - 04:03:01] that is correct so what
[04:03:01 - 04:03:03] we want to do is
[04:03:03 - 04:03:03] also get ahead of the
[04:03:03 - 04:03:05] game by beginning to offer
[04:03:05 - 04:03:08] the connect two these connect
[04:03:08 - 04:03:08] to funds to those students
[04:03:08 - 04:03:10] who right now would not
[04:03:10 - 04:03:12] qualify for that financial aid
[04:03:12 - 04:03:12] we do have have been
[04:03:15 - 04:03:15] using tay but those funds
[04:03:15 - 04:03:18] are also very limited so
[04:03:18 - 04:03:18] at this time i'm going
[04:03:18 - 04:03:19] to go ahead and turn
[04:03:19 - 04:03:19] to dr han who will
[04:03:19 - 04:03:21] talk to you a little
[04:03:21 - 04:03:23] bit about the financial aspects
[04:03:23 - 04:03:26] of connect to thank you
[04:03:26 - 04:03:26] so much dr perez i
[04:03:26 - 04:03:30] will just move this slideshow
[04:03:30 - 04:03:32] along this we considered this
[04:03:32 - 04:03:32] sort of a um the
[04:03:32 - 04:03:35] other book end you know
[04:03:35 - 04:03:38] of houston reconnect was to
[04:03:38 - 04:03:38] older learners you know above
[04:03:38 - 04:03:40] 25 years of age and
[04:03:40 - 04:03:40] who had stopped out we
[04:03:42 - 04:03:42] consider this sort of the
[04:03:42 - 04:03:44] compliment it's students who might
[04:03:44 - 04:03:46] be here or thinking about
[04:03:46 - 04:03:46] coming here in a younger
[04:03:48 - 04:03:51] age bracket perhaps um and
[04:03:51 - 04:03:51] this fits in nicely with
[04:03:51 - 04:03:53] our financials because it doesn't
[04:03:53 - 04:03:56] jeopardize our day's cash on
[04:03:56 - 04:03:56] hand as much as 30
[04:03:58 - 04:03:58] million or 10 million might
[04:03:58 - 04:04:00] have so that made me
[04:04:00 - 04:04:00] really happy so at this
[04:04:02 - 04:04:02] point we're looking at a
[04:04:02 - 04:04:04] million dollar investment one time
[04:04:04 - 04:04:07] and we would treat this
[04:04:07 - 04:04:07] as a pilot test um
[04:04:07 - 04:04:09] and find out whether short-term
[04:04:09 - 04:04:11] completion results do match our
[04:04:11 - 04:04:13] expectations it would be offered
[04:04:13 - 04:04:13] through the fi financial aid
[04:04:16 - 04:04:16] channel not through the foundation
[04:04:16 - 04:04:18] um and again it would
[04:04:18 - 04:04:20] be offered to eligible students
[04:04:20 - 04:04:20] in high se in selected
[04:04:22 - 04:04:22] high demand workforce programs but
[04:04:22 - 04:04:25] with without many other delimitations
[04:04:25 - 04:04:26] they would have some financial
[04:04:26 - 04:04:29] need or just want to
[04:04:29 - 04:04:29] be in one of those
[04:04:29 - 04:04:31] programs uh and it would
[04:04:31 - 04:04:31] be offered until funding is
[04:04:33 - 04:04:33] no longer available we don't
[04:04:33 - 04:04:34] want to see this we
[04:04:34 - 04:04:34] don't know if it's going
[04:04:34 - 04:04:36] to work as we expect
[04:04:36 - 04:04:36] so we don't want to
[04:04:38 - 04:04:38] see this as a perpetual
[04:04:38 - 04:04:40] scholarship program yet so first
[04:04:40 - 04:04:42] come first serve we're thinking
[04:04:42 - 04:04:42] that we may divide it
[04:04:42 - 04:04:44] up 5 million for each
[04:04:44 - 04:04:46] long semester just to make
[04:04:46 - 04:04:46] it a little fairer that
[04:04:46 - 04:04:49] the spring students get the
[04:04:49 - 04:04:51] benefit as well here is
[04:04:51 - 04:04:51] what we looked at in
[04:04:51 - 04:04:54] terms of actual numbers uh
[04:04:54 - 04:04:54] for fy25 so those are
[04:04:54 - 04:04:56] the five subject matter areas
[04:04:56 - 04:04:58] and the totals of the
[04:04:58 - 04:04:58] students involved at each level
[04:05:01 - 04:05:05] of award um at one
[04:05:05 - 04:05:05] point we also looked at
[04:05:05 - 04:05:07] um associate degree students but
[04:05:07 - 04:05:09] we felt that the return
[04:05:09 - 04:05:09] on that would take much
[04:05:11 - 04:05:11] longer and might be questionable
[04:05:11 - 04:05:13] we don't know what the
[04:05:13 - 04:05:16] state uh funding might be
[04:05:16 - 04:05:16] in the outy years so
[04:05:16 - 04:05:18] it seemed like a little
[04:05:18 - 04:05:18] riskier so we limited it
[04:05:21 - 04:05:23] to shorter term programs still
[04:05:23 - 04:05:23] in a high demand field
[04:05:25 - 04:05:25] however so those were the
[04:05:25 - 04:05:29] actuals then we took that
[04:05:29 - 04:05:29] 3303 and we projected out
[04:05:32 - 04:05:32] what we are hoping to
[04:05:32 - 04:05:36] see in fy26 big emphasis
[04:05:36 - 04:05:36] on selling the iclc's and
[04:05:36 - 04:05:38] osas huge increase we we
[04:05:38 - 04:05:38] think we can do it
[04:05:40 - 04:05:40] um for the semester credit
[04:05:40 - 04:05:42] hours we also think that's
[04:05:42 - 04:05:45] possible so we're looking at
[04:05:45 - 04:05:45] moving from 3 300 roughly
[04:05:47 - 04:05:47] students this year to 4
[04:05:47 - 04:05:49] 700 next year and they
[04:05:49 - 04:05:49] there would be a handsome
[04:05:51 - 04:05:51] return if we could achieve
[04:05:51 - 04:05:52] this because again it's just
[04:05:52 - 04:05:54] a million dollar investment and
[04:05:54 - 04:05:54] we'd make almost 5 5
[04:05:58 - 04:06:01] million in return so financially
[04:06:01 - 04:06:01] it's it's safe and it
[04:06:05 - 04:06:05] looks like it could be
[04:06:05 - 04:06:07] promising i asked the question
[04:06:07 - 04:06:08] okay money out the door
[04:06:08 - 04:06:08] what are we going to
[04:06:08 - 04:06:10] do to track it because
[04:06:10 - 04:06:10] you know i care a
[04:06:10 - 04:06:11] lot about every penny that
[04:06:11 - 04:06:13] goes out of here and
[04:06:13 - 04:06:13] what i heard back i
[04:06:13 - 04:06:15] liked it was going to
[04:06:15 - 04:06:15] check on the number of
[04:06:15 - 04:06:17] students who applied who were
[04:06:17 - 04:06:19] offered scholarships who actually enrolled
[04:06:19 - 04:06:21] how successful they were in
[04:06:21 - 04:06:23] their courses what the retention
[04:06:23 - 04:06:25] was fall and then fall
[04:06:25 - 04:06:25] to fall and actually the
[04:06:27 - 04:06:27] completers the completers is what
[04:06:27 - 04:06:29] makes my heart sing because
[04:06:29 - 04:06:31] that's what brings money back
[04:06:32 - 04:06:32] so any questions we'd be
[04:06:32 - 04:06:33] happy to so any questions
[04:06:33 - 04:06:34] we'd be happy to entertain
[04:06:34 - 04:06:36] entertain we're we're ready to
[04:06:36 - 04:06:41] launch this whenever you say
[04:06:41 - 04:06:41] go trustees any whenever you
[04:06:41 - 04:06:41] say go trustees any questions
[04:06:41 - 04:06:43] questions what is dit i'm
[04:06:43 - 04:06:48] sorry data information technology i
[04:06:48 - 04:06:48] asked the same thing so
[04:06:48 - 04:06:48] you're not i asked the
[04:06:48 - 04:06:48] same thing so you're not
[04:06:48 - 04:06:52] alone alone it's digital digital
[04:06:52 - 04:06:52] yeah so close digital yeah
[04:06:52 - 04:06:53] so close she she digital
[04:06:53 - 04:06:56] information technology so close so
[04:06:56 - 04:06:56] so i appreciate y'all bringing
[04:06:56 - 04:06:58] this forward i appreciate the
[04:06:58 - 04:07:01] limited scale and the the
[04:07:01 - 04:07:01] spirit of the pilot um
[04:07:01 - 04:07:04] it made me think of
[04:07:04 - 04:07:04] two things um as you
[04:07:05 - 04:07:05] know both reviewed the the
[04:07:05 - 04:07:08] content beforehand and you were
[04:07:08 - 04:07:11] talking one um pilot begets
[04:07:11 - 04:07:11] a follow on right and
[04:07:11 - 04:07:12] so um you could also
[04:07:12 - 04:07:14] say reconnect as a pilot
[04:07:14 - 04:07:14] just at a a slightly
[04:07:14 - 04:07:16] grander scale so i think
[04:07:16 - 04:07:19] going into the next budget
[04:07:19 - 04:07:19] cycle it would be helpful
[04:07:19 - 04:07:21] to be thinking through kind
[04:07:21 - 04:07:23] of the next step as
[04:07:23 - 04:07:23] we start seeing the revenues
[04:07:23 - 04:07:26] from reconnect and connect 2
[04:07:26 - 04:07:27] hit the books how we're
[04:07:27 - 04:07:27] going to use that kind
[04:07:27 - 04:07:30] of paying it forward to
[04:07:30 - 04:07:32] either expand access to those
[04:07:32 - 04:07:32] programs or to use you
[04:07:34 - 04:07:34] know as a as a
[04:07:34 - 04:07:36] you know revenue adder to
[04:07:36 - 04:07:37] other existing programs just understand
[04:07:37 - 04:07:37] how we're going to continue
[04:07:39 - 04:07:39] to build on that success
[04:07:39 - 04:07:41] um so that we can
[04:07:41 - 04:07:41] be every year kind of
[04:07:41 - 04:07:43] expanding opportunity you know using
[04:07:43 - 04:07:44] it to to get more
[04:07:44 - 04:07:47] and more and more um
[04:07:47 - 04:07:47] so that was number one
[04:07:47 - 04:07:47] number two um so that
[04:07:48 - 04:07:48] was number one number two
[04:07:48 - 04:07:50] um um we you as
[04:07:50 - 04:07:50] you mentioned before dr han
[04:07:53 - 04:07:53] we uh had some pretty
[04:07:53 - 04:07:57] um aggressive conservative um budget
[04:07:57 - 04:07:58] assumptions when we approved the
[04:07:58 - 04:07:58] budget in the in the
[04:08:01 - 04:08:01] spring um and just i
[04:08:01 - 04:08:03] want to make sure like
[04:08:03 - 04:08:03] this this is a good
[04:08:03 - 04:08:04] idea but i want to
[04:08:04 - 04:08:04] make sure that we don't
[04:08:04 - 04:08:08] kind of chunk away at
[04:08:08 - 04:08:10] potential in additional than planned
[04:08:10 - 04:08:10] revenue 1 million at a
[04:08:12 - 04:08:12] time i think it would
[04:08:12 - 04:08:13] be helpful in the near
[04:08:13 - 04:08:13] future to have kind of
[04:08:13 - 04:08:17] a holistic view of you
[04:08:17 - 04:08:17] know some of the um
[04:08:19 - 04:08:19] program oriented spend that was
[04:08:19 - 04:08:21] cut at the last minute
[04:08:21 - 04:08:22] or um some of the
[04:08:23 - 04:08:23] deferred maintenance high regrets that
[04:08:25 - 04:08:25] we had to cut because
[04:08:25 - 04:08:27] we were nervous about revenues
[04:08:27 - 04:08:27] this year so rather than
[04:08:29 - 04:08:29] chunk one you know this
[04:08:29 - 04:08:30] program here that program there
[04:08:30 - 04:08:32] let's take a slightly more
[04:08:32 - 04:08:34] holistic view about where either
[04:08:34 - 04:08:34] we would want to invest
[04:08:34 - 04:08:35] or potentially even where we'd
[04:08:35 - 04:08:37] want to reduce the tax
[04:08:37 - 04:08:37] rate um so that we're
[04:08:39 - 04:08:39] taking a more programmatic approach
[04:08:39 - 04:08:41] to allocating that the hopefully
[04:08:41 - 04:08:43] excess revenue that we'll benefit
[04:08:44 - 04:08:46] from well the only concern
[04:08:46 - 04:08:47] i would have there and
[04:08:47 - 04:08:49] i understand what you're saying
[04:08:49 - 04:08:49] and there'll be paragraph two
[04:08:51 - 04:08:51] after i get this first
[04:08:51 - 04:08:53] one out is we shouldn't
[04:08:53 - 04:08:53] really be using reserves for
[04:08:56 - 04:08:56] operational costs so that i
[04:08:56 - 04:08:57] cringe a little bit when
[04:08:57 - 04:08:59] you say deferred maintenance because
[04:08:59 - 04:09:01] that's sort of an operational
[04:09:01 - 04:09:01] cost unless it was you
[04:09:03 - 04:09:03] know a building caught on
[04:09:03 - 04:09:05] fire a big emergency something
[04:09:05 - 04:09:07] crashed and burned we would
[04:09:07 - 04:09:07] need those funds um the
[04:09:07 - 04:09:09] other point i'll make going
[04:09:09 - 04:09:11] out here on a limb
[04:09:11 - 04:09:11] we are starting to plan
[04:09:11 - 04:09:14] for the fy27 budget cycle
[04:09:14 - 04:09:14] now because we want to
[04:09:17 - 04:09:17] start it much sooner and
[04:09:17 - 04:09:19] gather inputs in a more
[04:09:19 - 04:09:19] holistic way so that when
[04:09:19 - 04:09:20] the board sees the budget
[04:09:20 - 04:09:22] they see all parts of
[04:09:22 - 04:09:22] it at first and we
[04:09:22 - 04:09:25] will emphasize it's very drafty
[04:09:27 - 04:09:27] it will change over the
[04:09:27 - 04:09:29] months but you will have
[04:09:29 - 04:09:29] a whole view over several
[04:09:31 - 04:09:31] months that you can feedback
[04:09:31 - 04:09:33] on we'll present it again
[04:09:33 - 04:09:35] feedback on present it again
[04:09:35 - 04:09:35] so you have a chance
[04:09:35 - 04:09:36] to work on the whole
[04:09:36 - 04:09:36] thing al together i think
[04:09:38 - 04:09:38] that'll give you a great
[04:09:38 - 04:09:42] opportunity to see this weave
[04:09:42 - 04:09:44] in yeah just just one
[04:09:44 - 04:09:45] response um i appreciate your
[04:09:45 - 04:09:48] concern about continuing to dip
[04:09:48 - 04:09:48] into the the reserve balance
[04:09:48 - 04:09:50] for operational items i'm 100
[04:09:50 - 04:09:52] in agreement with you on
[04:09:52 - 04:09:52] that and the more that
[04:09:52 - 04:09:54] we can use this moment
[04:09:54 - 04:09:56] in time to pivot ourselves
[04:09:56 - 04:09:59] toward using revenues for operating
[04:09:59 - 04:09:59] cost versus dipping into to
[04:10:00 - 04:10:00] the revenue b or reserve
[04:10:00 - 04:10:02] balance that would be a
[04:10:02 - 04:10:02] good thing so thanks for
[04:10:02 - 04:10:03] calling that out thank you
[04:10:03 - 04:10:07] thank you madam chair thank
[04:10:07 - 04:10:07] you yes your mic guard
[04:10:09 - 04:10:09] um i i really like
[04:10:09 - 04:10:11] that y'all are taking an
[04:10:11 - 04:10:11] innovative approach to this i
[04:10:15 - 04:10:15] i i'm i'm really i'm
[04:10:15 - 04:10:17] excited about and i like
[04:10:17 - 04:10:17] the fact uh like trusty
[04:10:17 - 04:10:19] chie said that it's a
[04:10:19 - 04:10:19] pilot program that we can
[04:10:21 - 04:10:21] see how it goes and
[04:10:21 - 04:10:23] really and that we are
[04:10:23 - 04:10:23] measuring results i expect nothing
[04:10:27 - 04:10:27] less from you uh uh
[04:10:27 - 04:10:29] miss han because you know
[04:10:29 - 04:10:29] we want to see exactly
[04:10:30 - 04:10:31] what's working why it's working
[04:10:31 - 04:10:33] and all of that in
[04:10:33 - 04:10:33] order to make things broader
[04:10:36 - 04:10:36] so uh i'm i'm very
[04:10:36 - 04:10:38] pleased with this presentation because
[04:10:38 - 04:10:39] it is something new and
[04:10:39 - 04:10:39] something that's really going to
[04:10:43 - 04:10:43] help our students directly thanks
[04:10:51 - 04:10:51] well i'm also um i'm
[04:10:51 - 04:10:52] i'm glad to hear that
[04:10:52 - 04:10:52] you know we're trying to
[04:10:52 - 04:10:54] do something for our students
[04:10:54 - 04:10:56] and helping them uh because
[04:10:56 - 04:10:56] we've been out there in
[04:10:59 - 04:10:59] the community and uh again
[04:10:59 - 04:11:01] the number one concern is
[04:11:01 - 04:11:01] how are they going to
[04:11:01 - 04:11:05] be able to pay their
[04:11:05 - 04:11:05] their fees and um so
[04:11:08 - 04:11:12] i'm just um if we
[04:11:12 - 04:11:12] approve it then how soon
[04:11:12 - 04:11:14] or how are we going
[04:11:14 - 04:11:14] to reach out to the
[04:11:16 - 04:11:16] students so that they can
[04:11:16 - 04:11:20] so they can take advantage
[04:11:20 - 04:11:20] of this and is our
[04:11:20 - 04:11:21] the different personnel at the
[04:11:21 - 04:11:24] all the college going to
[04:11:24 - 04:11:25] know this information so again
[04:11:25 - 04:11:25] how are we going to
[04:11:25 - 04:11:28] reach out to the students
[04:11:28 - 04:11:28] to inform them of it
[04:11:30 - 04:11:33] i can yes chancellor thank
[04:11:33 - 04:11:33] you very very much is
[04:11:33 - 04:11:35] through our strategic communications and
[04:11:35 - 04:11:39] marketing plan in fact starting
[04:11:39 - 04:11:41] immediately uh dr deal uh
[04:11:41 - 04:11:44] mr um duplantis and other
[04:11:44 - 04:11:46] members of the team will
[04:11:46 - 04:11:46] start working with the college
[04:11:48 - 04:11:48] uh vice presidents deans and
[04:11:48 - 04:11:51] presidents to start looking at
[04:11:51 - 04:11:54] the outreach that can be
[04:11:54 - 04:11:54] done in order to address
[04:11:54 - 04:11:56] the students and then of
[04:11:56 - 04:11:58] course there will be a
[04:11:58 - 04:11:58] decision that will be made
[04:11:58 - 04:12:01] as we collaborate whether or
[04:12:01 - 04:12:04] not it's 500 000 for
[04:12:04 - 04:12:04] the first semester 500 000
[04:12:04 - 04:12:06] for the next semester or
[04:12:06 - 04:12:09] whether or not they want
[04:12:09 - 04:12:09] to launch all of that
[04:12:09 - 04:12:11] at one time and so
[04:12:11 - 04:12:11] we'll share that information with
[04:12:14 - 04:12:14] you also on the wab
[04:12:14 - 04:12:16] but this will be decided
[04:12:16 - 04:12:16] upon and we're going to
[04:12:16 - 04:12:19] move forward expeditiously the same
[04:12:19 - 04:12:21] way we did with reconnect
[04:12:21 - 04:12:24] as well and we've already
[04:12:24 - 04:12:24] found out from the community
[04:12:25 - 04:12:25] town hall meetings or the
[04:12:25 - 04:12:27] partnership meetings pardon me from
[04:12:27 - 04:12:29] those community partnership meetings that
[04:12:31 - 04:12:31] there are students who are
[04:12:31 - 04:12:32] eager to enroll if they're
[04:12:32 - 04:12:34] asking now about houston reconnect
[04:12:34 - 04:12:34] how can i be a
[04:12:34 - 04:12:37] part of that right now
[04:12:37 - 04:12:39] and so i'm really absolutely
[04:12:39 - 04:12:39] confident that with this new
[04:12:41 - 04:12:41] initiative that we will not
[04:12:41 - 04:12:43] have difficulty getting students who
[04:12:43 - 04:12:45] will be interested in going
[04:12:45 - 04:12:47] into these programs for the
[04:12:47 - 04:12:49] short-term credentials of value and
[04:12:49 - 04:12:49] that will be working through
[04:12:49 - 04:12:52] our colleges and through the
[04:12:52 - 04:12:54] advisory committees because we're certain
[04:12:54 - 04:12:56] also based upon our discussions
[04:12:56 - 04:12:58] that there are advisory committees
[04:12:58 - 04:13:00] with the various companies that
[04:13:00 - 04:13:00] we work with that would
[04:13:03 - 04:13:03] be more than delighted to
[04:13:03 - 04:13:05] help identify and recommend persons
[04:13:05 - 04:13:07] who work at their companies
[04:13:07 - 04:13:07] to take advantage of this
[04:13:07 - 04:13:08] companies to take advantage of
[04:13:08 - 04:13:11] this opportunity opportunity thank you
[04:13:11 - 04:13:11] um really excited about it
[04:13:13 - 04:13:13] and you know i know
[04:13:13 - 04:13:15] when i ask a question
[04:13:15 - 04:13:15] it opens up more questions
[04:13:15 - 04:13:17] but i need to find
[04:13:17 - 04:13:19] out on this the transportation
[04:13:19 - 04:13:19] could you give us an
[04:13:19 - 04:13:22] idea of how transportation's going
[04:13:22 - 04:13:24] to help i know we've
[04:13:24 - 04:13:24] been reaching out uh trusty
[04:13:27 - 04:13:27] vanderbilt and myself have been
[04:13:27 - 04:13:29] reaching out to metro so
[04:13:29 - 04:13:29] is this going to be
[04:13:29 - 04:13:31] part of it to help
[04:13:31 - 04:13:32] of it to help absolutely
[04:13:32 - 04:13:34] absolutely wonderful yes and of
[04:13:34 - 04:13:35] course there's a flyer that
[04:13:35 - 04:13:36] was developed that will be
[04:13:38 - 04:13:38] going out the cec met
[04:13:38 - 04:13:40] on monday and approved approved
[04:13:40 - 04:13:42] the plan so you cared
[04:13:42 - 04:13:42] to address that dr horn
[04:13:43 - 04:13:43] would love to would love
[04:13:43 - 04:13:45] to as a matter of
[04:13:45 - 04:13:45] fact i had reached out
[04:13:45 - 04:13:48] to the metro contact on
[04:13:48 - 04:13:50] her vacation and she answered
[04:13:50 - 04:13:50] so that was a good
[04:13:50 - 04:13:51] thing we were waiting for
[04:13:51 - 04:13:53] them to develop a contract
[04:13:53 - 04:13:53] since this is a new
[04:13:53 - 04:13:55] program for them they weren't
[04:13:55 - 04:13:55] quite ready for us to
[04:13:57 - 04:13:57] be as ready as we
[04:13:57 - 04:13:59] are we originally started out
[04:13:59 - 04:13:59] i'll be really brief with
[04:14:04 - 04:14:04] a 69 000 cost everyone
[04:14:04 - 04:14:06] in a group felt that
[04:14:06 - 04:14:06] was maybe excessive we reduced
[04:14:06 - 04:14:10] it to 23 000 so
[04:14:10 - 04:14:10] a 66 cut we did
[04:14:10 - 04:14:13] that in a collaborative way
[04:14:13 - 04:14:15] um what it amounted to
[04:14:15 - 04:14:15] was the six colleges the
[04:14:17 - 04:14:17] brickandmortar colleges each would get
[04:14:20 - 04:14:20] batches of a 100red discounted
[04:14:20 - 04:14:22] cards we would now the
[04:14:22 - 04:14:23] difference is students got a
[04:14:23 - 04:14:23] discount previously under the old
[04:14:25 - 04:14:25] plan they would still get
[04:14:25 - 04:14:27] a 50 discount under the
[04:14:27 - 04:14:29] new plan but we absorbed
[04:14:29 - 04:14:29] the cost of activating the
[04:14:33 - 04:14:33] cards 2 each and and
[04:14:33 - 04:14:35] subsidizing or sponsoring the card
[04:14:35 - 04:14:37] so this amount of sponsor
[04:14:37 - 04:14:39] sponsorship we limited compared to
[04:14:39 - 04:14:39] our first view so students
[04:14:39 - 04:14:41] would get four free rides
[04:14:41 - 04:14:43] with that discounted card it
[04:14:43 - 04:14:45] would follow the same implementation
[04:14:45 - 04:14:45] plan that we used for
[04:14:45 - 04:14:47] the old q card which
[04:14:47 - 04:14:47] is already in place so
[04:14:48 - 04:14:48] we're ready to go we're
[04:14:48 - 04:14:50] now just waiting for a
[04:14:50 - 04:14:54] contract approval through through legal
[04:14:54 - 04:14:57] we're ready you any other
[04:14:57 - 04:14:59] questions concerns not then we're
[04:14:59 - 04:14:59] ready to vote on item

[04:16:43 - 04:16:45] i'll be really brief here
[04:16:45 - 04:16:45] uh basically we're doing well
[04:16:47 - 04:16:47] financially we are ahead of
[04:16:47 - 04:16:50] the game in terms of
[04:16:50 - 04:16:50] revenue and expense both we're
[04:16:53 - 04:16:53] at roughly 83 3 of
[04:16:53 - 04:16:59] the year completed as of
[04:16:59 - 04:16:59] june and we have um
[04:16:59 - 04:17:01] 96 of expected revenue based
[04:17:01 - 04:17:03] on the budget so that's
[04:17:03 - 04:17:05] wonderful although state appropriation payments
[04:17:05 - 04:17:08] are a little slow coming
[04:17:08 - 04:17:08] coming in uh we're still
[04:17:08 - 04:17:10] getting what we need to
[04:17:10 - 04:17:12] get by likewise on expenses
[04:17:12 - 04:17:12] 83 of the month of
[04:17:12 - 04:17:16] the year complete only 75
[04:17:16 - 04:17:19] of the expenses used up
[04:17:19 - 04:17:19] that's not an advertisement for
[04:17:19 - 04:17:23] the group let's just report
[04:17:23 - 04:17:26] um so we're doing well
[04:17:26 - 04:17:26] in terms of income statement
[04:17:28 - 04:17:28] and the operating fund one
[04:17:28 - 04:17:34] there are no great variances
[04:17:34 - 04:17:34] to be aware of we
[04:17:37 - 04:17:37] may have a little bit
[04:17:37 - 04:17:38] of additional cost at some
[04:17:38 - 04:17:38] of the colleges only because
[04:17:40 - 04:17:40] their programs are are blossoming
[04:17:43 - 04:17:43] welding in particular uses more
[04:17:43 - 04:17:44] supplies than originally anticipated in
[04:17:44 - 04:17:46] the budget because they're doing
[04:17:46 - 04:17:49] very well so i really
[04:17:49 - 04:17:51] can't complain any questions at
[04:17:51 - 04:17:53] all about income statement okay
[04:17:53 - 04:17:55] i'll keep rolling oh question
[04:17:55 - 04:17:57] trusty sh yep just just
[04:17:57 - 04:18:00] wanted to confirm so the
[04:18:00 - 04:18:01] uh the outstanding state appropriation
[04:18:01 - 04:18:01] funding that came in in
[04:18:02 - 04:18:02] the month of july so
[04:18:04 - 04:18:04] it it did it was
[04:18:04 - 04:18:04] a little late we got
[04:18:06 - 04:18:06] 15 7 million in july
[04:18:06 - 04:18:09] that was supposed to be
[04:18:09 - 04:18:09] here in june um we're
[04:18:09 - 04:18:12] expecting a tiny little dollop
[04:18:12 - 04:18:13] of 46 000 in september
[04:18:13 - 04:18:13] because the state had to
[04:18:15 - 04:18:15] recalibrate the amount of supplemental
[04:18:18 - 04:18:18] payment we would get their
[04:18:18 - 04:18:20] math not ours um and
[04:18:20 - 04:18:23] so this year we've received
[04:18:23 - 04:18:23] 68 7 million of total
[04:18:23 - 04:18:24] received 68 7 million of
[04:18:24 - 04:18:25] total appropriation appropriation appropriation yep
[04:18:25 - 04:18:27] yep okay and then second
[04:18:27 - 04:18:29] question is there's there's a
[04:18:29 - 04:18:30] pretty big variance on the
[04:18:30 - 04:18:34] um which one nope yep
[04:18:34 - 04:18:34] it was the investment portfolio
[04:18:36 - 04:18:36] the investment portfolio so is
[04:18:36 - 04:18:38] are is is that additional
[04:18:38 - 04:18:40] spending going to hit between
[04:18:40 - 04:18:40] now and the end of
[04:18:40 - 04:18:41] the fiscal year or are
[04:18:41 - 04:18:41] we pretty much where we're
[04:18:43 - 04:18:43] at and we're just going
[04:18:43 - 04:18:44] to expect to see that
[04:18:44 - 04:18:48] variance that that'll probably persist
[04:18:48 - 04:18:53] it was um we had
[04:18:53 - 04:18:53] roughly 30 million 32 million
[04:18:55 - 04:18:55] to spend uh 9 7
[04:18:55 - 04:18:58] million of vendor payments 700
[04:18:58 - 04:19:01] 000 student refunds 20 million
[04:19:01 - 04:19:01] of payroll to cover you're
[04:19:04 - 04:19:04] welcome um and then 1
[04:19:04 - 04:19:06] 2 million in payroll taxes
[04:19:06 - 04:19:06] so that we needed the
[04:19:09 - 04:19:09] funds for that purpose and
[04:19:09 - 04:19:11] so uh that squeezed us
[04:19:11 - 04:19:11] a little bit in terms
[04:19:11 - 04:19:13] of the investments we're expecting
[04:19:13 - 04:19:15] to see i'm expecting to
[04:19:15 - 04:19:16] see another uh fund mature
[04:19:18 - 04:19:18] another bond mature in september
[04:19:18 - 04:19:20] that will be 10 million
[04:19:20 - 04:19:20] so that will be will
[04:19:20 - 04:19:20] be 10 million so that
[04:19:20 - 04:19:23] will be coming coming and
[04:19:23 - 04:19:23] then last question um just
[04:19:23 - 04:19:25] swag are we still kind
[04:19:25 - 04:19:25] of in the 10 million
[04:19:26 - 04:19:28] revenue for the year yes
[04:19:28 - 04:19:28] i'm might be nibbling away
[04:19:28 - 04:19:30] a little bit here and

[04:21:04 - 04:21:04] have i don't want to
[04:21:04 - 04:21:06] give you the wrong number
[04:21:06 - 04:21:15] i don't have that what
[04:21:15 - 04:21:15] what i'm getting at for
[04:21:15 - 04:21:18] the board is i would
[04:21:18 - 04:21:18] like to see the day
[04:21:18 - 04:21:20] when this institution you know
[04:21:20 - 04:21:24] when i first came on
[04:21:24 - 04:21:24] we had about a billion
[04:21:24 - 04:21:26] dollars in in debt and
[04:21:26 - 04:21:26] we paid it down to
[04:21:26 - 04:21:27] about debt and we paid
[04:21:27 - 04:21:28] it down to about 400
[04:21:28 - 04:21:31] 000 400 000 or 400
[04:21:31 - 04:21:34] million now that's our outstanding
[04:21:34 - 04:21:34] debt i'd like to see
[04:21:34 - 04:21:38] us get that paid off
[04:21:38 - 04:21:38] and instead of paying 1
[04:21:38 - 04:21:40] 5 million a month in
[04:21:40 - 04:21:43] interest we put that in
[04:21:43 - 04:21:43] the bank for a building
[04:21:43 - 04:21:45] program and for a deferred
[04:21:45 - 04:21:49] maintenance program rather than paying
[04:21:49 - 04:21:52] i know the bond uh
[04:21:52 - 04:21:52] selling attorneys don't want to
[04:21:52 - 04:21:54] hear me say this but
[04:21:54 - 04:21:54] i'd like to see it
[04:21:56 - 04:21:56] where we got in a
[04:21:56 - 04:21:59] position where this board and
[04:21:59 - 04:21:59] this institution could run on
[04:22:02 - 04:22:02] a cash basis and we
[04:22:02 - 04:22:07] could finance everything uh inhouse
[04:22:07 - 04:22:07] and we get uh to
[04:22:09 - 04:22:09] that position that would be
[04:22:09 - 04:22:12] a wonderful position for financially
[04:22:12 - 04:22:13] for this position for financially
[04:22:13 - 04:22:15] for this institution institution that's
[04:22:15 - 04:22:16] what i'm getting at it's
[04:22:16 - 04:22:16] just a matter of getting
[04:22:16 - 04:22:19] enough fund enough fund reserves
[04:22:19 - 04:22:21] to pay it all off
[04:22:21 - 04:22:21] at once that's the issue
[04:22:21 - 04:22:23] so you know and there's
[04:22:23 - 04:22:23] you know i know some
[04:22:25 - 04:22:25] of them come due and
[04:22:25 - 04:22:28] you can't pay them off
[04:22:28 - 04:22:28] until the due date and
[04:22:28 - 04:22:32] all that but yeah uh
[04:22:32 - 04:22:32] increasing our fund balance and
[04:22:35 - 04:22:35] that so we can pay
[04:22:35 - 04:22:38] this total debt down and
[04:22:38 - 04:22:38] become debtree and then not
[04:22:38 - 04:22:40] have to pay interest for
[04:22:40 - 04:22:44] stuff thank you i would
[04:22:44 - 04:22:44] love to include that as
[04:22:44 - 04:22:48] if i'm allowed to in
[04:22:48 - 04:22:48] the budget next year well
[04:22:48 - 04:22:50] no but you were reading
[04:22:50 - 04:22:50] my mind as perhaps a
[04:22:51 - 04:22:51] guiding principle i'm going to
[04:22:51 - 04:22:54] be asking you all for
[04:22:54 - 04:22:57] guiding principles i am going
[04:22:57 - 04:22:57] to be proposing some that
[04:22:57 - 04:23:00] you can react to and
[04:23:00 - 04:23:00] you can add to during
[04:23:02 - 04:23:02] the conversation in september so
[04:23:02 - 04:23:05] that as we roll out
[04:23:05 - 04:23:08] our advanced speedier budget cycle
[04:23:08 - 04:23:08] for fy27 we can include
[04:23:08 - 04:23:09] those comments and then make
[04:23:09 - 04:23:11] sure what we develop aligns
[04:23:11 - 04:23:13] with what you're looking for
[04:23:13 - 04:23:14] if we can afford it
[04:23:16 - 04:23:16] looking forward to seeing it
[04:23:16 - 04:23:21] okay thank you chancellor well
[04:23:21 - 04:23:21] i i think dr han
[04:23:21 - 04:23:24] has summed it up i
[04:23:24 - 04:23:24] think what you have just
[04:23:24 - 04:23:25] said trusty wilson is something
[04:23:25 - 04:23:29] that we desire as well
[04:23:29 - 04:23:29] and that we want to
[04:23:29 - 04:23:32] move toward and that we
[04:23:32 - 04:23:33] will move and accomplish because
[04:23:33 - 04:23:34] i think we all feel
[04:23:36 - 04:23:36] the same way there are
[04:23:36 - 04:23:40] so many needs and to
[04:23:40 - 04:23:40] have the debt that is
[04:23:40 - 04:23:42] constantly uh bedeviling us is
[04:23:42 - 04:23:43] something that is really preventing
[04:23:43 - 04:23:43] us from doing some of
[04:23:45 - 04:23:45] the magnificent things that we
[04:23:45 - 04:23:47] know are are really going
[04:23:47 - 04:23:50] to serve our community and
[04:23:50 - 04:23:50] our students well so with
[04:23:50 - 04:23:51] that what i'd like to
[04:23:51 - 04:23:52] ask is whether or not
[04:23:54 - 04:23:54] with the other request if
[04:23:54 - 04:23:55] we could get that information
[04:23:55 - 04:23:55] and send it to you
[04:23:56 - 04:23:56] via that information and send
[04:23:57 - 04:23:58] it to you via wab
[04:23:58 - 04:23:59] wab yes please thank you
[04:24:00 - 04:24:03] glad to do it uh
[04:24:03 - 04:24:03] trusty davis did i hear
[04:24:03 - 04:24:05] you yeah dr i i
[04:24:05 - 04:24:06] was trying to just get
[04:24:11 - 04:24:11] clear were you inferring that
[04:24:11 - 04:24:13] not using debt is now
[04:24:13 - 04:24:13] a guiding principle or you
[04:24:15 - 04:24:15] would just add in comments
[04:24:15 - 04:24:18] and you would solicit other
[04:24:18 - 04:24:21] thoughts from other trustees about
[04:24:21 - 04:24:25] utilizing debt or well i
[04:24:25 - 04:24:25] was i was suggesting that
[04:24:25 - 04:24:28] we have a couple of
[04:24:28 - 04:24:30] guiding principle principles we've put
[04:24:30 - 04:24:32] together after my whopping eight
[04:24:32 - 04:24:32] months here and the other
[04:24:32 - 04:24:34] staff members on the team
[04:24:34 - 04:24:36] and we would propose those
[04:24:36 - 04:24:36] as examples of guiding princip
[04:24:38 - 04:24:38] principles because we want to
[04:24:38 - 04:24:40] start out with that for
[04:24:40 - 04:24:40] the fy27 budget cycle we
[04:24:42 - 04:24:42] want to have the guiding
[04:24:42 - 04:24:44] principles we want to have
[04:24:44 - 04:24:44] some guidelines for what it
[04:24:46 - 04:24:46] is we're building so that
[04:24:46 - 04:24:48] we know we're meeting the
[04:24:48 - 04:24:48] needs of our customers and
[04:24:50 - 04:24:50] our stakeholders so that was
[04:24:50 - 04:24:52] just i was just noting
[04:24:52 - 04:24:52] it as a possible addition
[04:24:52 - 04:24:55] to that laundry list it's
[04:24:55 - 04:24:58] by no means complete or
[04:24:58 - 04:24:58] you know exclusive i would
[04:25:02 - 04:25:02] just re certainly i would
[04:25:02 - 04:25:06] just retort that this trustee
[04:25:06 - 04:25:06] is not of the position
[04:25:09 - 04:25:09] that not utilizing debt should
[04:25:09 - 04:25:13] be a a guiding principle
[04:25:13 - 04:25:13] as based on what uh
[04:25:13 - 04:25:15] i know and i'm not
[04:25:15 - 04:25:18] saying that other than the
[04:25:18 - 04:25:18] simple fact i think financing
[04:25:18 - 04:25:21] tools should all be available
[04:25:21 - 04:25:23] at our disposal and we
[04:25:23 - 04:25:23] have to be able to
[04:25:23 - 04:25:28] on a casebycase basis analyze
[04:25:28 - 04:25:30] and determine what uh funding
[04:25:30 - 04:25:33] mechanism we should apply so
[04:25:33 - 04:25:33] i would i would want
[04:25:33 - 04:25:37] to register my dissension with
[04:25:37 - 04:25:39] a unilateral approach or declaration
[04:25:39 - 04:25:47] of principle okay heard you
