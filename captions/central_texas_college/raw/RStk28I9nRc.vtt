WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.620
you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:29.980
Thank you.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So, we're going to use the same line, but we're not going to use the same color.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We're going to use a different color, and we're going to use the same combination of the color.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:51.980
Thank you.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:21.980
Thank you.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.920
This, uh, this, this is about in the, um, the New York Times book last year, where it said,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.600
so I can say, who's captured.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.480
And I, there are some people who are doing that, some people are hiding, some people are,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.800
some are lying, some people are trying to get it.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.680
Um, so, last year, this, I'm going to capture it, but please, I'm trying to get to,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.540
I have done this before, and I can say I'm going to capture it this year.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.540
I think it's important to note that last year, the most important democracy in the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.540
country, the Indian presidency, that time, I missed my films and I didn't get to look

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.540
at them today, I'm concerned that the time that we're here, that story that defined the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.540
modular census, when the Trump had the vote and when the Washington state in turn took

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.540
the modular vote, I think it's very much important that we understand that we recognize

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.579
And rather than make things a lot more than I believe them,

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.140
I think we are missing this in the last passing day of the debate.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.720
First, the four issues for those inflation and for insurances.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.660
What the rate of loss for buyback in fact is, is an open and reasonable number for the buyback.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:42.000
That is just that perfect door that the inflation network that manages the price of tax relief.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and you're staying steady, and I'm interested in learning how to approach this.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I'm interested in working with these athletes and getting their call in.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
You're a leader.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And how do you provide your practice without the specific standards for how to work,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
how to raise those practices, to be a guide and support for the efficiency of the program

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
for learning about what's going on in the field,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
so you're fully connected to these institutions and just let the data show that it's possible?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And I think that's one of the things we know, that brings me in to know more of the media here.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000
We have that power and we can move and then do ourselves part of the work and we'll do it ourselves.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And give you the power to make those decisions.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I'm not going to go into tax data or anything like that.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And I can stop you after the good night.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But first, if we are ready, we promise you that.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.760
And it's an identifiable and a way to be an American executive program.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.000
That's it for now.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I have speech procedures, not only in the race.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I know that we have some positions for Minnesota.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And I think it's actually interesting to describe how many of the representatives of this party

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
are moving to the party, not only in the case of the two-bucket traffic, there's even five types of taxes.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.160
So we have an arc so many people can have, which is actually what's happened with that.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.480
But we have had these four tiers that have actually come together to help us.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.800
We've had the section members, we've had the department of insurance, we've had the

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.840
health office.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.920
We've had the animal safety, since about 4 or 5 years ago, we've had the federal government

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.880
and we've had that to be a large part of that.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.160
Thank you very much.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:49.640
Thank you.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.620
you

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.620
you

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.620
you

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.620
you

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.620
you

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.620
you

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.620
you

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.620
you

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.620
you

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.620
you

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.620
you

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.620
you

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.620
you

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.620
you

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.620
you

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.620
you

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.620
you

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.620
you

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.620
you

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.620
you

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.620
you

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.620
you

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.620
you

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.620
you

00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.620
you

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.620
you

00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.620
you

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.620
you

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.620
you

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.620
you

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.620
you

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.620
you

00:22:59.000 --> 00:22:59.620
you

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.620
you

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.620
you

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.620
you

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.620
you

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.620
you

00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.620
you

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.620
you

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.620
you

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.620
you

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.620
you

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.620
you

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.620
you

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.620
you

00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.620
you

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.620
you

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.620
you

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
All right, thank you.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.600
We have a number of questions.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.500
You're going to have time.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.400
We're going to do a number of readouts and retailers,

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.900
so if you have more questions,

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.360
you've already heard me request some of the privacy

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.040
requirements and special instructions

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.940
so we'll tell them to walk you through again.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.540
Yeah.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.200
I have a very good message.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.580
I'd love you to remind you of the things

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.920
that I have on the workshop that generally only control

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.920
It's more of a, I wish, well, I don't know if I said it, but it's like I said,

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.920
I'm a, I'm a staff at work, and I'm a team coach, and I'm a work manager.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.920
I'm on a variety of different things.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.920
And so, the other thing is, is that you can, the rest of the time,

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.920
the people that I serve, they just have a lot of people.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.920
So, it's really a lot of our community, and the fact that you're in the class,

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.920
is a lot of great connection.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.920
So, I thought, you know, this is, this is our dream, and I'm glad that we,

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.680
We will be coming back here on May 29th.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.680
Question 2.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.680
Second.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:37.680
We're going to have the same session, the same discussion, three different sessions.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.680
We're going to try to have a session.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.680
Okay.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.680
I want to welcome everybody.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.680
We will take a few minutes.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.680
We have a special meeting which we have in the hall for this class.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.680
Here's our motion to approve.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.680
I hope you've enjoyed this talk today.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680
Thank you.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.680
I hope you have a great day.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.680
Thank you.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.680
I hope you have a great day.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.680
Thank you.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.680
And so, that's going to be the end of the program for today.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.680
If you have topics that are important to you,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.680
please post them in the chat box.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.680
But first, I'm going to turn it over to the mic.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.680
And we'll listen to each other and do one or two more.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.680
So, we're going to do one and then we'll do the other one.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.680
Okay.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.680
Thank you.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.680
Thank you, Ms. Harris.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.680
Ms. Ford?

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.680
I have one item under legislative update, question 46, which files under the

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.680
recommendation, and it would not be a recommendation that the district

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:39.680
representative or the county or the county board would present the report.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.680
And I just wanted to make sure that the chair seems to be happy to be in

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.680
I think it's very important to provide for the workers.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.680
Thank you. So, about 1,500 percent of social workers are under-educated.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.680
And that's actually really a big thing in Texas. It's a big problem in the community.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.680
But I'm not sure you can be a full-size-fit, you know, a class of different girls,

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.679
and that's really not going to be a good one for you to not be able to introduce to the community.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.679
So, if it was really not a good one for the community, what would you say to the girls?

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:17.679
Now that they're in the community, they have the point to expand to the third and even the last of their team.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:22.679
And they don't need funding to support our position in the area.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:25.679
That's one of the things that I think I'd love to do that.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:32.679
And I would also say that if you have two or three materials and the type of the two is space,

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:36.679
there's something you have to suck or make quite a bit of a difference.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.679
And it's also a great way to explore, um,

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:43.679
easy-to-read translation with the world as their place.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.679
So it's sort of a two-tier kind of, um,

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.679
factor with, um, online.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:54.679
And, and we know that Eric may not have listened to the debate

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.679
until he looked at the floor,

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.680
but he was asking him,

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.680
and there were a lot of comments back from the public at the lab

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.680
and students and families saying that, um,

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.680
there was more to do.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.920
So, we were trying to make a short period of time, like 30 days, fill in all the contents that, um,

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:17.680
it wasn't that hard to get that, that kind of a loop, really worked out the best way you could.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:25.280
So, that is, um, the general idea of putting a local course, but maybe with some more reporting skills,

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.320
then we're going to have a lot of good work going on in the college system.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.080
Yeah, that's what I'm getting at with the application.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:38.080
So, there was a lot of input from the point of view of the expenditure with the cap.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:43.080
I was wondering now, with the cap and the expenditure that we're putting forward,

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:48.080
because we'll take a side of energy, so I didn't have to do the first 25 cents forward,

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:56.080
but it was nice that you were really with the company and the company,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.080
and they found one and they're going to do that.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.080
And I would get the real opinions on that.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.080
And that really is what actually came out of it.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.080
So I think that's the way that it all

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.080
came about, the way that you're going to do it.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.080
And one of the things that we're going to do

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.080
is we're going to tell you guys what all this is.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.080
And the things that we're trying to do

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.080
are really just to tell you what all this stuff is

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.080
because we're going to tell you what's in the collection.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:33.080
the challenge of this question I want to ask about the social justice development.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.080
I actually need to get it discussed.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.080
That's fine.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.080
You know, I'm really pretty sure we're not going to have any issues with the

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.080
environmental issues, but I'm going to be able to talk to you about the issues.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080
Thank you.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.080
I don't know, so I'm glad to be able to speak with you.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:54.080
We're doing the same thing with the workshop, so I think I'm pretty sure that we're going to be able to do it.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.080
I think you can go ahead.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.080
I'm not sure.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.080
Yeah.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.080
Yes.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.080
But I can tell you that's the first one.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.080
I think it's pretty interesting.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080
Yeah.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080
Yeah.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.080
I'm going to go ahead and take a question.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.080
Yes.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.080
Yes.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.080
So that's the question.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.080
And I'm going to take a question from there.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.080
But if there are any questions.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.080
No.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.080
No.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.080
I think this could be the last one.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.080
I'll try to do it.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.080
All right.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.080
And I think we're going to end up with a summary.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.080
And I'm going to take a question about the whole world.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:31.140
So, so, the second one, the second one we have, and, so, Colin, I think you said this,

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:40.740
so she's got six specific jobs, and for, for 25 years, I've had a number of different

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.100
students, and, and, and one of my favorites is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is,

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:50.100
is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is,

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:56.100
There are also other networks with more cash flow and social data.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.100
And that's just a general idea.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.100
Okay.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.100
The current number which is actually 24 is from the University of Alabama.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.100
We have 22 students.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:10.100
And the number that we're active with right now is the number that we're using.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.100
So we have 249 students.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.100
And we have a limit.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.100
By the numbers we are calling the number that we have, we have about 2,000 students.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.980
And then we will have to still register it so they can get it.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:22.480
OK.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:22.980
Thank you.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.480
Thank you.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:23.980
Thank you.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.480
Thank you.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:34.180
And then we have to get the

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.480
And then we have to get the

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.220
around that.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.720
Around that.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.360
Or if they're including the

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.220
Yeah.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.720
And then we have to get the

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.800
So if you're looking for some

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.160
question, I can go right in.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.660
Right.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.260
We are not.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:47.860
We are not.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.360
We are not.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:48.860
We are not.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.360
We are not.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:49.860
We are not.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.360
Actually, that's probably why we didn't

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.460
do a lot of studies, which is that we can

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.160
just stay here and show them, and maybe

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.560
at the end, we'll remember.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.420
Yeah, so we are.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.960
We're not the system.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.060
To me, we don't have a set of thoughts

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.700
that tell us what to do.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.200
We are not.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.460
We don't.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.620
But that's not our perspective.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.660
We are not the system.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.920
We are not the system.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.380
We are not the organization.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.080
We are not the organization.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.080
Okay, thank you very much.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.080
I don't know if you want to talk about the

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.080
the actual traffic, but there's

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.080
a lot of people who are really

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.080
doing the hardware and the field work

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.080
and the things that we're doing

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.080
and we're working on.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.080
So can you repeat the question?

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.080
No, I'm just saying, I'm trying to work on

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.080
the video. Okay.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.080
So, I'm just saying, I'm trying to work on the video.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.080
I'm trying to work on the video.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.080
I'm trying to work on the video.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.080
So, do you have any other questions?

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.600
And I was just like, I can't do this anymore...

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.580
So he was like, no.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.180
I'm like, no.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:49.900
And that was it for it.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.660
And I'm like, okay.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.320
I'm thinking about what else is going on.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.200
So, I'm trying to figure out what else is going on.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:54.940
I'm thinking about what I'm talking about.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:55.340
We have two.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:55.840
OK.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.320
So we have really haven't actually, we have so much

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.820
on the table.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.240
I imagine that you have 10 plus people.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.940
Are there any others?

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.240
Do you have?

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:06.740
I think so.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.820
So I have like four developers.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:09.540
Oh, OK.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.880
And then we have this very close.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.880
from the 25th of May up to the 24th of August.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.880
Okay.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.880
Thank you.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.880
Okay.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.880
We got around to 21,000 people at 9,000,

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880
and that's good.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.880
That's a lot of people.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.880
So, we did it with our child,

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.880
and then on the 18th,

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.880
and the 13th of May,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.880
we had a very good conference.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.880
We were very busy.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.880
We had a very good experience,

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.880
and we actually had a lot of questions

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.880
from the audience,

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.880
and we had a lot of questions.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.880
And we had a lot of questions

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.800
And it's really important to know that you're not stopping till you're in the right place.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.640
And I'm telling you that the learning that I've had is that it's very different.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:51.320
So I'm thinking, how does this play out in the classroom?

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.240
How do we do it?

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.240
Thank you.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.240
Okay, I think we got this.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.240
Okay, thank you.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.240
We're going to have a quick meeting.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.280
And I think we're going to roll the line as far as the way to find and change what's

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:11.120
so we know that can be a big opportunity for the community.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.160
But, as we move into the next phase,

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.340
I would invite you to ask your questions.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.160
Thanks very much.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:17.660
Thanks.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.180
Thank you.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:18.680
Thank you.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.180
Thank you.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:19.680
Thank you.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.180
Thank you.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:20.680
Thank you.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.180
Thank you.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:21.680
Thank you.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.180
Thank you.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.680
Thank you.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.180
Thank you.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:23.680
Thank you.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.180
Thank you.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.260
Thank you.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.100
Adam is going to sit down.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.040
He's a staff engineer at the Newport

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.720
and will be presenting the next session.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.200
and move up to the second one.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.260
Now let's look at the second one of our measures.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.600
So this one, we have the best amount

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.920
of blue-clover promising us this quarter.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.300
The next measure is the third measure.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:51.120
And here in that happen, we have a very big number there,

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.000
and we're lower than that.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.460
So below here is where we're going to look at

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.520
the capillary distribution of blue-clover,

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.260
also, you know, have a dialogue with the people in the city,

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.660
and it's a good thing.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.380
So I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to do a lot of professional

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:10.000
training, and I'm trying to identify the things that I'm

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.240
trying to do, and I'm trying to do the facts, and I'm trying to

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.080
answer them.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.760
And I'm trying to learn how to do it,

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.580
and I'm trying to do it in terms of the kind of data

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:22.240
that we need to be able to have on this period of time.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.160
So I'm trying to learn how to do this,

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:28.380
So I'm not going to ask you to do that.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.160
So this is the last one from my side.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.000
So this is the last one from my side.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
So you can see it.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.620
I don't know what to do.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.120
I think we're done.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.720
So I'll just get one, we have two, and one.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.220
OK.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.400
So we're done.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.100
So we're done.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.440
All right, that's good.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:45.920
Thank you.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.960
And we're done.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.540
Thanks.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.040
OK.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:55.140
Yeah, I'm happy, um, and then there's LACA, which I don't think there's something extra

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.140
related.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.140
Okay.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.120
There's, uh, another one that I, I have to say.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.980
People don't know where that comes from.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.980
Right.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:04.980
On the coverage.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.980
We've got a question.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:14.940
Um, no, I don't think there is any, uh, other different, um, like, benefits for the women

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.440
We know we're moving in a new direction.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.040
We need to do something to increase the pressure.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.140
We need to go to the other side.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.240
We need to go to the other side.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.840
We just need to go to the other side.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.340
And slowly and slowly, we see that we're moving in a new direction.

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.940
We're going to continue to do it manually.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.840
So it's either adding or it's competing.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.540
So we're going to play around with modeling and testing

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.540
and I think that's a big difference in our

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.540
thinking about how we can

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.540
improve.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.540
And we have some good answers over there.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.540
If you want to get a picture over here,

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:51.540
I can do that.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.540
I mean, I don't know whether

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:54.540
you want to go over there.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.540
I don't know if you want to go over there.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.540
I think we'll have to do that.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.540
Yeah, I think we'll go over there.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.540
And then I'm going to ask you,

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.540
if you just want to

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.540
make a quick point.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:05.540
I think if you want to ask,

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.540
I think if you want to talk about something

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.540
I think that's a good point.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.040
I think that's a good point.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.540
Most of the time, we see a lot of people that we don't know

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.540
the people that we don't know.

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.540
And that's a really good point.

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.540
And I don't know how we can escape from the truth.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.540
It doesn't matter.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.540
It's so important.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.540
It's the environmental thing.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.540
And I'm telling you, with the kinds of challenges

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.540
that just all of us have had, it's really hard.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.540
And I'm sure that's why I'm not a doctor.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:36.540
But there's a question.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:45.540
Is it better to go back to the main, the big idea of terms like trace test codes that work so well with the filter?

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.540
Can I share?

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.540
Yes.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.540
That's what you're saying?

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.540
Yes.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.540
Can you tell me what that is?

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.540
I'm not sure.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:55.540
I'm not sure.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.540
I'm not sure.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.540
I'm not sure.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.540
We're just looking at the variables and the form.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.540
The form and the index.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.540
Okay.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.540
Thank you.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.540
Okay, so I'm going to ask you a question for me.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:09.540
Yeah.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:15.540
John, how many of the question have I asked in doing this?

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.540
What was your question?

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.540
How many of those questions do I want to ask?

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.540
I have a couple.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.540
How about a few more questions?

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.540
Oh, you've never said.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.540
Go ahead.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:31.540
You also said you have the annual and fiscal week.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.540
The team that started the team is from the financial support team,

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:39.540
who is our manager, and we are the public health service team,

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.540
and we help the team with a lot of the financial support issues.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.540
We are the founders of IndieBank,

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.540
and we've been traveling around the world,

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.540
and we've been working with the financial support.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.540
And we've been working with the financial support team,

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.540
and we've been working with that team.

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.540
so um

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.540
um

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:18.540
So I'm talking about some of the PTO deals and other things that are in place.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.540
So that's one of the things.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:28.540
This is a further study with the proper contract and the increase by the announcement of contract

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:35.540
for the new web app team, which is a second place and a 9.4% increase in the contract rule.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.540
Is there a change?

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.540
There's a change.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.540
Thank you.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.540
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.540
I have a discussion with Mr. Bush.

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:54.660
Mr. Bush, the

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:59.660
I think the challenge is the knowledge of force and opposition.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:04.660
The challenge is the fact that there is a very large global tax rate.

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.660
And that's a dismal look.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.660
It's a dismal look to any other thing in this country.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:14.660
The problem is that we are more biased than the other side of the story in this country.

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.660
And I just want to make sure that the challenge is not only to the United States,

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.660
I'm going to try to keep up with you.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.660
I'm probably going to have to go back

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.660
to one of the questions that you said before.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:27.660
Thank you.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.660
Thank you.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.660
I'll get back to you.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.660
I have one more question.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.660
I have one more question.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.660
Can you please propose a follow-up question?

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.660
Roger.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.660
I have a follow-up question.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.660
I just wanted to ask, we've got a little bit of time

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:50.280
I'm just going to run over to the microphone.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.860
Let me just go through a little bit of the key.

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.360
You can go.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:55.860
Yes.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:01.400
Yeah.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:01.900
Yeah.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:04.040
Yeah.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:04.540
Yeah.

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:05.040
Sure.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:05.540
All right.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.040
All right.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:06.540
All right.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.040
All right.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.540
All right.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.040
Yeah.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:09.540
Yeah.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.040
Yeah.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:10.540
Yeah.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.040
Yeah.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:11.540
Yeah.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.040
Yeah.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:12.540
Yeah.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.040
Yeah.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:13.540
Yeah.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.040
Yeah.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:14.540
Yeah.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.040
Yeah.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.040
I see my hands.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.040
Oh, so what if there's a nice, bright, bright energy?

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.040
It's not a trend.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.040
You don't want that.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.040
Oh, yes.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.040
I don't do that.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.040
I don't do that.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:37.040
But, you know, to do the job, if you're stuck at home and you work by yourself, you don't have to know.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.040
I get it.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.040
I get your story.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.540
So the bus is not, we don't see the bus.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:45.540
We don't see the bus.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:48.540
But the bus is so used to the air we don't see the bus.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:53.540
So at this point we can go somewhere to get a bus there.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.540
Here's my room.

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.040
Okay, this is the main seat, actually.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.040
Okay.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:16.040
I just want to say, I knew that it was a motion because it expected funding to require

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:21.040
an extra $11 million in revenue. And as you know, there was a percentage out here.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.040
And we knew that it was like, okay, we're going to go around and do it for $15 million

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:30.040
and look at that $15 million. And it's a really good way to make a profit.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.720
So I mean, that's not the same.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.800
I think it's different.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.300
Yeah.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.980
But what would you be writing if you were a writer?

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.000
I would be writing a book.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.500
Yeah.

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.280
How do you write a book?

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.780
I would be writing a book.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.580
What would you be doing while you're writing a book?

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:46.360
I would be writing a book.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.220
I don't know.

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.240
I don't like to think you would be doing these kind of

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:50.740
sessions.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:53.860
I think you're good.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.240
I think you're good.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.380
She said you could write this book.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:56.880
Yeah.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.380
Yeah.

00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:57.880
Yeah.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.380
Yeah.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:04.380
but that's the other thing I've got to remember is that I was speaking to all of you today

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:09.380
about the investigation and I think we're all going to talk about it.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:15.380
But what we know is that in Washington we're still very fractured.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:21.380
I guess we're in the middle of the impact of the disaster and we're going to change it.

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:26.380
I'm going to come back to that in a minute.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:33.380
Obviously if you keep moving or do a fast jump, then the nation is going to be affected.

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:41.380
But at the same time, it's not very, very easy.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.380
And the other thing is that you have to be able to do it in a very short amount of time.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.380
So you have to be able to do it in a very short amount of time.

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.380
And you have obligations. You have to be able to do it in a short amount of time.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.380
And that's the fact that we're only going to be able to do it in a short amount of time.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:58.380
So, the terminal is running, you know, at about the top of the line.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:05.380
And the, um, the output to the terminal is actually at the bottom of the line.

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:11.380
So, you know, you have to, you can't go in and find out, um, if it's not working.

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.380
So, you can't go in and find out if it's working.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:19.380
I did read the grant application from that.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.380
I was going to come back and have you go through the process and then look at that.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:26.380
And also I think it's a good idea to do the clinical test.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:31.380
So the wild biopsy, are you going to come back here?

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:40.680
If there's a new candidate that we want to kill this, we're going to have to send this

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.080
child to the hospital.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080
Okay.

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.520
So I think that's a pretty good answer.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.840
I think that's a good answer.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.900
Any other comments?

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:48.960
Any other comments?

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:49.660
I don't know.

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:50.320
I don't know.

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:50.880
I don't know.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.040
I don't know.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:52.880
I just don't think that we can do it.

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.380
I don't know.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:53.920
I don't know.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.560
I just don't think that we can do it.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.920
Most probably, the first question

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.620
that I might want to do is, if you know a bit about how

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:03.120
the world works and if you think it's

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.140
appropriate in that way, and how it works,

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.700
and how it can be applied to the world,

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.820
I would like to hear it.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.260
I would love to hear it.

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:16.780
and then we can use that one to look at it.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.880
So I don't know, I didn't have a little bit of time.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.680
So I'm going to go ahead and just go ahead.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.720
And I want to look at this one.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:34.040
I was doing express 6, which was a pretty normal

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.220
like no problem at all.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.260
But I don't know if that's how it's going to look.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.260
That's how it looks when you're doing some double break.

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:46.900
And then we have to make sure that we have the right approach to it.

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.260
And we can do that.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.400
I think that's the point.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:58.400
In fact, we're going to do a great deal of work

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.720
right from the start of the medical care.

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.300
But we're going to do it.

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.340
And we're going to do it.

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.500
And we're going to do it.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.180
And we're going to do it.

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.340
And we're going to do it.

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:09.840
Yeah.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.340
Yeah.

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:10.840
Yeah.

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.340
I can see it as complicated.

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:12.840
OK.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:18.340
So if you want to go to zero or 9-0,

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.340
you can go to 9-0.

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:21.840
Yeah.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.340
You go to 9-0.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:22.840
You go to 9-0.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.340
Right.

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:23.840
7-9-0.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.340
7-9-0.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:24.840
Yeah.

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:25.340
Yeah.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:25.840
OK.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.340
OK.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.340
That would be the 5-9-2.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:27.840
Right.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.840
That would be 7-2-0.

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.340
That would be 7-2-0.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:32.840
Right.

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:33.340
Yeah.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:33.840
That's right.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:34.340
That's right.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:34.840
That's right.

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.340
So I'm going to go to 10-0.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:36.840
OK.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.340
OK.

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.340
So, yeah, I think it's a nice thing to do.

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:47.340
And then, the main reason why I'm going to start there,

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.340
because I'm going to be able to do a lot more

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.340
of the training for this week,

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.340
that's not going to be the goal.

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:55.340
The goal is to have a lot of productivity

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:57.340
to encourage people to do it.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.340
So, I'm going to go back to the beginning

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.340
of the program, and I'm going to share my

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.340
feedback that you would send to the students.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:07.180
I'm very interested in the learning.

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.920
It's a complex problem.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.380
There's a lot of information about the application

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.280
but in the actual application,

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.480
I have no idea what that means.

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.400
I feel like now there's a lot of data

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.660
that we'll probably take from the library

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.160
that we have in 256.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.160
I'm not a developer, I just don't know

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.360
about the methods.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.560
Is that the ultimate gap?

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.100
Is that the ultimate gap?

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:53.460
which is one of the first and oldest

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.040
Does it reflect the secondary speed?

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.360
Zero, Zero, zero.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.180
Oh, zero.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:57.900
That's right.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.900
Zero, Zero.

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:00.840
Zero.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:02.400
That's right.

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.400
Zero, Zero, Zero.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.000
Zero, Zero.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.080
Zero, Zero, Zero.

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.140
Zero, Zero.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.040
Zero.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.220
We're very excited to see the speed.

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:11.740
We're going to go with .

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.640
We're going to go with .

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.500
Zero.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.420
Zero, Zero.

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.860
Zero, Zero, Zero.

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:20.660
Zero.

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.420
Zero.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.660
Okay, you guys can take that one right now.

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.180
Okay.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:25.680
Okay.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.180
Okay.

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:26.680
Okay.

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.820
Why are you bringing to that profile?

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.360
Because the person is going to be the one who's going to tell you.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.860
So I think you might just say,

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:36.280
okay, this is the person that you're going to tell me.

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:39.080
And then two of the thousands that you're going to tell me are.

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.080
These are my nurses.

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:40.580
Yeah.

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.980
And I think you're going to have to go through them.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.280
So you're going to have to go through them.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.420
And you're going to have to do the first visit.

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:47.780
And the first visit, no.

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:48.980
The first visit is the first visit.

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:50.480
And the last visit is the first visit.

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:56.480
I just wanted to add this to the fact that the increase in user memory,

00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:01.480
memory, in service by hand, dot, two, days,

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.480
is an impact on the score.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:11.480
They are not a quick measure of the average, but it's really a good example of the basic learning practices.

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.480
Okay.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.480
I know it's a little short, but I'm going to take your time.

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.480
So, yeah.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.480
Okay.

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.480
And there's a new one from the

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.480
American Foundation, and we're going to

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.480
have a motion to approve the

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.480
share.

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.480
Okay.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.480
Okay.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.480
Okay.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.480
Okay.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.480
Okay.

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.480
Okay.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.480
Okay.

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.480
Okay.

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.480
Okay.

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.240
Thank you, Thank you.

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.220
Annle?

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.240
Yeah?

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.900
So here's what you gave us a Rohit,

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.320
you could really do,

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.940
Anyway, as you can see,

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:37.640
So, this is the image of the

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.400
I think it's not true.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.200
I'm not watching this.

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.120
I'm not reading this.

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.800
I'm not interested in this.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.360
I'm not watching this.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.080
We are not in a relationship.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.980
I want to see you all come back and I want to see you

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.920
get to come back to this.

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:57.140
It's so important that we get this right.

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.700
We're not on the farm.

00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.200
We're not on the farm.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.640
And we can't say we're not on the farm.

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:02.360
We are on the farm.

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.460
We're not on the farm.

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:08.060
I just want to be comfortable.

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:11.020
I want you to be comfortable with the new movement.

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.180
What happens if the new state university

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:17.560
is not in the top of the line to find a new movement?

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.060
What happens?

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.280
The new movement is that the government

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.620
needs to be able to get out of the way.

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:26.160
How do you get out of the way?

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.300
How do you get out of the way?

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:33.460
I mean, it will be very difficult in the future.

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.460
I don't know, maybe they can put a project project on top of it.

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.460
I think that would be a good idea.

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.460
That's a good idea.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:44.460
They could change the structure of the building to a retirement home location.

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.460
That's a good idea.

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.460
We'll get to that.

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.460
This one is on the left of the wall.

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:54.460
This is the discussion we should have had with the question book.

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:56.460
The question book is the number one.

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.460
And I think it is.

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.460
So I think that's the question I was going to ask.

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.180
that's what I'm looking for.

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.940
So that's the chapter chapter.

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.440
Thank you.

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.400
So that's the chapter chapter.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:12.060
We're going to look at the top of our list

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:16.960
for our table from the 2015-2016 census.

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.820
As you know, we have a particular case

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.400
on this day, which is the PPD.

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.500
The tax period for the purchase of the business

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.720
of the country.

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.940
The time balance of the time balance

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.940
So this is a very important, important project.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:37.300
We are in a long process in doing the MWM security.

00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:41.260
And we took our first turn in the business sector

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:44.680
and we're going to have a series of types of those procedures.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.240
What we're doing is we're saying we're

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.380
going to continue to work with the board

00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.180
and we're going to keep the papers.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:53.140
And yesterday there was one change to a US bank

00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:57.620
and the coordination, how we plan out and plan out

00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.540
where we're going to be, how we're going to shift

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.620
from the classroom to the team, and how we're going

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.660
to respond to that.

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.620
And I just want to remind everyone,

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.020
that's the last time we're closed.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:10.520
Thanks.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.560
And we have to take your report.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.060
David.

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.560
Yes.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.640
This is the first meeting of the day.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.860
We have a number of minutes left.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:20.760
And I'll just say the next slide.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.760
and those are pretty difficult to handle.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:31.760
And that's Michelle and I are still working on the final report on the CRO report.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.760
We've probably touched on a few things, but the first one, for the G3A,

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.760
the policy report is needed to work to support the G4 report,

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.760
which is a very important, very important piece on the CRO report.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:48.760
And we've seen that we've got a chance to have an agreement here.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.760
And the other one that we've been doing is achieving

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.520
improved access to the sectoral public events

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.000
and the large participation in the state tax income

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.840
act and the state contract price to get

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.100
to the industry and the public.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.420
And that's really what we're trying to do.

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.040
It's basically a tax cut.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.260
That's something I think that's number one way to actually

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.420
take action.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.340
That's one natural number.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.220
And the sixth, we're trying to get more of a cash control

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:19.220
and then we can take a side spot and see if we can move up the spot or not.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:27.220
So, this is basically a recommendation for people.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:32.220
I've learned that actually we can do this time by time.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:41.220
It was up till 7.25 and then 5.20 to 6 and then it's not good for you if you don't look at that.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.060
I'm not sure I'm saying it right.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:42.540
I'm not sure I'm saying it right.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.080
I'm not sure I'm saying it right.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:43.640
Thank you.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.040
Thank you very much.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:44.160
Thank you very much.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.700
Thank you very much.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.620
Thank you very much.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.220
Very good.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.140
I was going to ask you a question

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:55.240
on the user-friendly way of using the software.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.120
I feel like they do have a little bit more

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.240
of a mix there.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:10.160
The other one is about you being able to perform

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.360
here, where there is a p, and there's a p,

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.680
so there's a 1, 1, 1, 1.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.540
That's a point.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.760
What about that?

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.100
Of course.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:22.960
That's all right.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.920
OK.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.760
This rather particular problem, in the sense

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.440
that we've got this pyramid schedule,

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.000
there are ones that have been distributed in multiple units.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.920
But now they're changing them.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.580
And they're all in groups.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.460
I just take a note.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.400
All right.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:45.400
I'm a student at the University of Miami, and I was shown this in a state as well as a county, and found this at work.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:52.400
And what I wanted to show is that they do have a rule that this particular unit does require special use.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.400
And I think that's what I was going to require right in class.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.400
If they call me to talk about it, so they're the students that are going to do the time,

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.400
the time is the case, and we're going to state that that is the best option.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.740
So that's a big thing here.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.300
We really need more communication.

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.380
This is a big problem today.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.400
So I'm going to wait for this.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.680
But I'm going to wait for it to open up

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.640
for me and my ex-husband, who is basically

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.600
coming out of the war, too.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.940
That's probably why we need more data, I think.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:26.340
And we need to get more information.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.140
We also have a question.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.540
So I'm going to ask you a question.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.500
Is there a network that works with us

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.980
to do the research on the health of the poor?

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:43.980
Okay, so, for the HHS product, the consortium of the HHS participants participated in a

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.980
project, rather not the first, but it was a project regarding the cyber security and

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:52.980
developing a platform of care for the deaf and the blind.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:59.980
And we had a national contingent in North Carolina, and I talked about this earlier,

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:02.980
And I think that's a great story.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.980
And to be honest, the ex-specialist,

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.480
who is now a part of the grant, is

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.980
at the University of Denver, was

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:14.480
hired at New Germany University to attend the CEDNAC.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.480
In fact, he had a workshop with him.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:16.980
I think.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:17.980
Thank you.

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:18.480
Thank you.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.480
And the motion is ordered by the Board of Trustees.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.480
And the motion is ordered by the Board of Trustees.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.480
And the chair is now at the Board of Trustees.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.480
And the chair is now at the Board of Trustees.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.480
And the chair is now at the Board of Trustees.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.480
which I'm going to show you in a moment.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.480
I'm going to show you the model that is just using the center of the ring light

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.480
for the command for the 2020 plan for the next 12 months.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.480
I'm going to change.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:54.780
We've got a good list of questions.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.280
All right.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:02.520
We are going to ask you to present your awareness in terms of the environmental impact of these

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.520
documents.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.080
We have a few questions for you before we get to, for the afternoon, what's going to

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080
happen.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.700
This year we're gonna be in a city that has a large area.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:20.660
We had three entities that asked on necessary payments on time, under the current COVID-19

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:24.820
and the COVID-19 vaccination, which made it difficult to put the amount of money in the

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.900
bank account and the amount of extra money in the bank account, and we did pretty well.

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.620
The number of these officials is a large number of dollars.

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:35.540
We have started getting a case account to protect these recipients and we have been

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:39.060
trying to do that through the COVID-19 program.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:44.460
And the right-hand note, and after some, we're pretty clear that that's where we're going to be,

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:48.460
is that the place to put that, so that we're going to see the balance.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:55.660
And then the last one is the clean libraries, which is the five-step boundary of the main library.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.660
We'll add a certain library.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:01.260
And there's also some of the ones that they are requesting, which would be,

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:06.860
so they need to separate 12-folders from the rest, so students can go and check on the files.

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.860
So I'm going to go with that.

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:13.860
That's a good example of the discussion question.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:17.860
You can just watch it on the beach and just put your bag on the ground.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.860
I'm going to go on the ground to check that the super-super-small ground down is a good one.

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.860
Thanks for the information.

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:26.860
Thanks for having me.

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.860
Thanks for having me.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.860
Thank you.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.860
If you have any questions, I'm going to go ahead and start it up.

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:41.860
And just also to follow up on what Mr. Johnson said, I think so,

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.860
is that the right answer for you, Michelle?

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:50.860
Yes, I mean two other things we have just found.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:57.860
In principle, in which the third term has been received, and was sufficient for 27 years,

01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:58.860
Thank you.

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:03.860
And I also would like to thank the board for their support.

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.860
If you could give me a minute to review your report,

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.860
there may be a link in the chat.

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.860
And I do want to thank you for your help this morning.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:15.860
And I also want to thank the board for being able to request

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.860
that Mr. Duncan show the important details of the

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.860
department chair, the necessary section for the

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.860
criminal justice department in the board of trustees.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:32.860
the department chair, the professor, the lessons that professor, the chief medical center.

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:39.860
Is there a reason your board doesn't have a name?

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:40.860
I mean, how do you use your name?

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:42.860
We can have a name, but we can't use our name.

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.860
We can't use our name, but we can't use our name.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.860
So, we're going to use our name.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.860
So, we're going to use our name.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.860
Yes, I'm not aware of that.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:58.860
The next request from Sarah Desmond was with the University of Brisbane

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:05.860
and is currently developing the bank designs of building a network of artificial technology.

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:12.860
Is that, those of you who should go to the next session, discussion?

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:14.860
I do not know.

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.859
Many of you probably thought about this.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:22.859
I would say that this is a very good way to get money.

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:26.859
But you also need to make sure that you have some great money sources.

01:08:26.859 --> 01:08:30.859
Make sure that you have a good sample, that you have a lot of options you need to go for,

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:34.859
and don't check and don't overwrite the data which comes from the other people.

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:35.859
Not too much.

01:08:35.859 --> 01:08:43.859
You can also find, to be honest, you can find options for what people want to do.

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:53.859
They don't pay rents off on the house, but their insurance pay is $1,251,746.24.

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:59.859
This is the average for $59,025,000 for the first 20 years.

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:06.859
We have multiplied the interest on a very large amount of interest, which is about $12,000,

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:11.859
moving on to the second and the first quarter of 2017, so the 6th quarter of the year,

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:13.859
and the month of New Year's coverage.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:19.859
In the range of the New Year's premiums for 2020-21 New Year's premiums were $14,000

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:29.859
of overall premiums and premiums of $1,567,905.98 for the annual period.

01:09:30.859 --> 01:09:34.859
The significant decrease in that premium was the following month's coverage.

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:38.859
So we have several months which is our first week with the plan.

01:09:38.859 --> 01:09:40.859
About two months of that week.

01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:46.859
And the number of these funds has decreased by $35,862.

01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:55.860
We have an excellent corporate ratio with no major claims in the previous year, which helped us get those funds.

01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:06.360
And insurance in the United Kingdom, probably, it increased by 126,946 dollars in bank accounts.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:12.360
But last year, we did actualize the free-for-all with no labor claims in the previous year.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.860
And we found that insurance, which are donated by a city-state agency,

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:25.860
It increased by 436,000 dollars as it is in seats from last year in terms of base resources inflation.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:32.860
Now, I want to give you the example of the rate of return on energy by oil sales.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.860
Here's the chart. It's a contract activity of four.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:42.860
For each country, they need from 1,351 dollars to 726.

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:47.860
And for all of the other September 5 and September 26 fires for 24 cents,

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:51.860
for each of the October 1 and September 27 fires, it's $31,2026.

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:52.860
Thanks for the update.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.860
This is William Ryan.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.860
So I'm going to just get a question.

01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.860
I'm just going to go ahead and share some questions.

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:02.860
I see there are questions in the front here.

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:05.860
I'm going to take a look at the other one.

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.860
I'm going to go ahead and share some questions.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:15.660
I would say for pre-match to long-term, I'd say I would go for the most long-term and for the three-day-long-term.

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.660
Next slide.

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:21.460
And if you can't prove an exercise has to be in the same spot, don't go.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:25.060
I'll give you a counter on the first-year's HITs.

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:32.460
So in-hook coverage is $557,666.71.

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:38.100
20,000 people wanted to enter the park to August 24, 2026.

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.260
The end level was 8,000 for America and Haiti,

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.260
and then more for the United States.

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:47.460
So everyone was a few minutes far out of the park.

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:51.460
So in the 6th, the value fell on the 5th, which is the 7th.

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:56.460
When we compare the premiums for 2026 to the premiums of 2075,

01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:02.380
there was an overall increase in the premiums of 51,400 people.

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.460
I'm going to just go 43 cents.

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.980
And if you have a large cup of energy,

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.460
you can produce your salt with a large cup of water.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:13.380
That's a good part.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.880
So this is BF, which is a little cup of urine.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.300
It was decreased by 3,000 liters a year.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.560
And this is due to two more claims, which are the produce.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.800
So we have educators.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:30.980
They are a little different.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.440
I'm going to put this down here.

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:38.220
and their relatives, their doctors. So we have a large and exact team that works for

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:44.220
my firm and this includes a social engagement and assisted care in different ways.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:52.700
To the same time, there are increased 545,000 new clients. We have increased the number

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:58.300
of clients, but we have maintained the four clients we have clients, so that does keep

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:02.300
are going to be on their social inflation in this new transition.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:06.060
Now, over the long-term, the real-world interest rate,

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:12.300
2,000 and 101,000, the increase in benefits with inflation

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:17.300
will also be in the fleet that affects the three years.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.300
And we'll be looking at a lot of different places

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.300
that are coming out of the year that's going to be on the floor.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:31.300
This chart is based on cost per square foot, which is increased in this right now, in this

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.300
group box.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.300
Right.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:41.300
This is further increased by $2,880.00 for this year and again with your cost per square

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.300
foot in this red.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:49.300
And lastly, the last one here is the value of liberty, which is also dropped, which increased

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:56.300
increased by 3,000 dollars per year and the coverage is just about the same as last year.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:04.300
The CTCP administration recommends that the community can buy reference papers from a

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:14.300
local credit card in the employer with a U.S. rate of $57,657.65 per year check.

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:18.260
also to move into Article 5 of the next government policy.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:19.900
I don't know.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.560
Mr. Speaker...

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.060
I'm sorry?

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:23.560
I'm sorry?

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.660
Mr. Speaker, I'm sorry.

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.360
Mr. Speaker, I'm sorry.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:26.860
I'm sorry.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:27.500
I'm sorry.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.160
I'm sorry.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.180
Yeah, I don't want to do that.

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:29.680
Okay.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.200
Yeah, but, if this goes against the rule that no fundamental contracts

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.040
are allowed in New South Wales,

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.260
they will rise up to future elections.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:42.260
So this is actually a pretty good example of us reviewing the year of the year.

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:46.260
We're going to look at the largest year of services for each year in San Bernardino,

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:50.260
about $1,066.50.

01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.260
We're going to look at the largest numbers in financial assets.

01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:57.260
We're going to look at September 1, 2025 through August 31, 2026.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:01.260
Again, we have a little bit more information for tonight.

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:09.020
11, and then we move up to 2020.5 and start at August 21, 2026, but we haven't shown much

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.220
to continue that progress.

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:18.460
And the community level for 2020.6 to the exact 2020.5, there is an overall savings

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:25.260
in the previous year of $5.3 million in the break-even of the $17.6 for the normal period.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:30.260
The stability increase was over 900 of coverage.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:38.260
We have a higher stability on the high-volume team. It was looking increased by $200,000, no significant change.

01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:45.260
Our high-power high-volume team decreased by $175,000, no significant changes.

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:53.760
And it is the number one relative decrease by 13,201 dollars from last year.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:16:02.760
The value of the product was lower this year than last year and the overall rates of providing a typical decrease in premiums have increased.

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:11.760
The average rate of the market is the number one relative increase by 5,680 dollars in the last three steps from last year.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:18.160
I also please to give to the AP's a number of officers that were selected, three COVID-19 members.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.360
So we're stacked up more than before.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:27.600
They were all provided public health status, which are a permanent policy with no transfer or pre-missing date.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.560
CTC's admission number and full time name were approved.

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:38.960
The amount of assets in check value for contact action was filled with the list of incident services,

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:47.960
$216,498.95 for September 1, 2025 to August 25, 2020.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.960
And we'll have a meeting with the President, which will be on June 10, 2020.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960
So, it's a very long and busy meeting.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:56.960
Thank you.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:04.960
I just want to remind you that our overall savings for the program in the middle of the year is $123,880.90.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.860
But it's not always that you're accepting, I suppose.

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:08.860
I know, it's not always that you're accepting.

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:11.860
It's easy to get bored.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.920
The challenges in this area are being able to work on a target

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.080
that is both a job and service for a different way of

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.260
traveling, or whatever.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.260
Absolutely.

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:23.260
So how do they do work for you?

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.360
So they may be concerned with fact that this is not

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:28.380
a service, so that is a day in the life of an

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:29.780
industry that we can prepare.

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.380
Maybe it's up to the world for the 25,

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.380
but we have a story for the 26.

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:36.580
and for one year option groups.

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:39.380
So we have to put this one thought in mind.

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:44.580
On the 31st, the 22nd, the 3rd, the 4th, the 5th, the 6th, the 7th, the 8th, the 9th,

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.580
all kinds of things that we're trying to do.

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:50.580
So we have to realize that we have to try to be able to count services companies

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.580
to touch the market.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:56.980
And we're going to experience a high section of service team to be found in Oxford

01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:00.580
and a great opportunity to be such a big part of the analysis of the market.

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.300
I think that's the best thing you can do.

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:04.340
So I don't think that's the best thing to do.

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.800
So I think that's the best thing to do.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.280
And then we have the question.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.080
So I'll go with that.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.720
But again, this is probably the most interesting thing

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.860
we've done in the last year.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.200
We've done the answer to the question.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.060
We've done the answer to the question.

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.220
So if you're going to have a problem with this,

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.640
this would be one of the ways that we can

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:27.180
keep our jobs and our poor people.

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:34.780
So, this is a particular non-commitment of state court, in which in terms of the organization

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:40.780
and the organization orders, states are not in control of the state court's actions.

01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.780
So, I think that's a good point.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.780
Well, that was a good point.

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:49.980
Well, if the agency says to the court, we want to expand the contract, we can have a

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.380
contract, we can have a full contract, and then you have the section in which the agency

01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:58.460
to be able to connect to a bunch of people and move them to the same space.

01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.820
And it's a big, big, big step.

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.420
And I was actually going to ask a question about that.

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:04.780
So I have an idea of a switcheroo machine that you would use to see if you were able

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:06.860
to just block a contact and get a draw line.

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:10.860
But my point is to turn this into a changing switcheroo machine.

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:14.540
I'm going to try to figure out what's going to happen.

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:15.900
So I'm going to turn on the light.

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.180
I'm going to turn on the switcheroo.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.700
I'm going to turn on the light.

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:19.980
I'm going to turn on the light.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.820
Would it be a good idea to turn it off?

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:23.820
I'm going to see if it counts.

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.820
Yeah, we saw a few things happen.

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:29.820
Yeah, what we found in the back of fashion for the sport,

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:33.820
what they did for the articles,

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.820
the first I had to do was the organizational numbers,

01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.820
and you used that one.

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.820
And I wrote one and saw it up for the result.

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.820
So if you look at this back, it's a little taller than it should be.

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:45.820
Yeah.

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:50.820
And again, what we have is all the colors.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:57.820
So we are allowing the detection of the analogs, the detection field of analogs, to be the point of action right now.

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:01.820
So we are doing a minimum of 100 kHz, and that's correct.

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:06.820
This is a 50 kHz analog, and that's the frequency of the analog.

01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:09.820
And, um, this is the base.

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.820
And, um, I'm going to try to remember the values.

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.820
And the other is that we need to see the results.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:19.820
We've got to get this right.

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:20.820
We've got to get this right.

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:21.820
We've got to get this right.

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:22.820
We've got to get this right.

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:23.820
We've got to get this right.

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.820
And then we have to see the question,

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:29.820
and then we're going to see whether the address is based on the negative rule of the value.

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.820
And that's the first step.

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:33.820
If you can use the geographic rule in that,

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:36.820
it's a second rule, and then it goes in the network.

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.820
And then you're going to get the answer.

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:41.820
That's the most important thing.

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:46.820
Now, a portion of the motion to amend the report is actually about the end of the election.

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:51.820
If there's no one for the motion to amend, it's B.A. or H.A.C. for the election.

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.820
Is that the report you're talking about?

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:55.820
No, it's not.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:56.820
It's not?

01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:57.820
It is not.

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:00.820
If there's no one for the motion to amend, should I mark?

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:01.820
Is it loose?

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.820
No.

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:03.820
Okay.

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:04.820
Okay.

01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:05.820
I'll add it in.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:06.820
I'll add it in the motion.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.820
So this is a general rule that we have to come to after we've done all of this.

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.820
It's really, it's a big deal.

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:18.820
So I will, I'll make a very general rule, because I'm a computer scientist.

01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:20.820
I'm going to go ahead and run our work.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.820
Thank you very much.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:26.820
Before we get to talking to the programmers in the room, let's just talk about a few.

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.820
I have a question about the programming that you're doing right now.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:30.820
Yeah.

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.820
How do you do it?

01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:38.020
We've been thinking about the whole thing from Oxford all the way to the future even,

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.920
when I do not have all this money, but I will send it to you.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.420
I still won't be arriving.

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:43.220
Sure.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:43.920
Okay.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.920
We'll wait and see.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.520
It's a good idea.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.720
I'll send it to you too.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.220
Okay.

01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.320
Thanks a lot.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.120
Thanks a lot.

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.120
I'll get your help.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.420
I've put a little bit in here.

01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:53.020
Yes.

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:53.620
Spend it.

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:55.820
So, you can put a little money, put a little bit in here.

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.720
I'll send you ahead of the school board in a minute, 4, 5 minutes.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.220
Okay.

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.220
what's the price?

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:02.240
It's the first one.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.240
I'm sorry.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.240
It's zero eight cents.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.240
I'll give you a dollar for each of them.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.240
It's on the table.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.240
I'll give you a dollar for each of them.

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.240
I have to give you a dollar.

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.240
It's zero eight cents.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.240
It's zero eight cents.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.220
Here are the motions that the owner is giving us.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:22.240
So the motion is, the motion is you need to call the last license

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.240
and post by option.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.240
Now the job for that is how you do it.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:31.240
And then we use the pressure layer and we use 3.5.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.240
And we're going to put in a 3.5.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.240
We're going to increase the pressure.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.240
And we're going to increase the pressure.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.240
And then we'll see that it's better.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.240
So, give it more stress.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:47.240
And this one is much more comfortable.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.240
It's not.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.240
It's not.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.240
Great.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.240
Thank you.

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.240
That's great.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.240
I'm happy for you.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.240
Thank you.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.240
Well, thank you very much.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.240
And now we can talk about the next benefit.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.240
You know, the federal government has been very concerned about the acceptance of these

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.240
grants.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.240
This is a project that has been done at the exit of the National Congress for the 25th.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.240
I'm going to give you a little bit of a story from the State of Minnesota.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.240
So we're talking about the 59th, the 19th, the 21st.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.240
So, I'm going to tell you a little bit about the changes that we've made.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.240
So, we've made a lot of changes.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.240
We've made a lot of changes.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.240
We've made a lot of changes.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.240
We've made a lot of changes.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.240
We've made a lot of changes.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.240
We've made a lot of changes.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.240
We've made a lot of changes.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:26.240
I think we all know that the first step is to get a good, successful president.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.240
So, a good, successful president is a good president.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.240
If you can get a good president, then you can get a good president.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.240
And I think that's a good thing.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.240
I think that's a good thing.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.240
I think that's a good thing.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.240
The current election doesn't seem to be that important.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.240
The general election doesn't seem to be that important.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.780
I think I can go into the question.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.140
I don't know how many days, but I'm not sure.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:50.520
I don't know how many hours.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.500
I don't know how many hours.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.540
I don't know whether you know.

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:54.360
I don't know if you know.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.300
I don't think I do.

01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:57.500
I don't know how many hours I've done.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.920
We're not on the group list.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.620
We're not on the list.

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:03.020
I don't know how many hours we've done.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.800
We just need to ask, really, who are we talking about?

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.320
And why would that be the reason?

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:12.320
Okay.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:17.320
What does the prediction mean for taxes?

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:21.320
What does that mean for the transport from reserves?

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.320
You know, we have a question.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.320
You mentioned that when it comes to labor and oil,

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.320
you've been involved in the cost of the oil.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.320
If I can't solve the oil issues,

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.320
it's potentially a good idea.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:41.320
Now, as a primary engineer, I think it's important to have a strong sense of the situation.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:47.320
So, I wish to live more of my life with a project that doesn't really impact me.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:52.320
I think that's the second most important thing I want to do is to have a strong sense of the situation.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.320
And that's really the main reason why I'm here.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.320
We're going to go we're going to do that.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.320
Okay.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:02.320
So, I'm going to go to Eric and I'm going to put my end to the right side, right?

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.320
So, I'm going to move this, we're going to move this.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.320
Look what I'm doing so it's not just me making this all happen.

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.320
You know, all the very good I like to put them on the edge and all that.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:17.320
And then I'm going to put, I'm putting a little, a little bit of paint, a little bit of white paint on the edge of the edge.

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.380
Now, I'll write down what the premium would have been for the mobile device.

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:25.120
I'll hope that we can cover more details.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.180
That would help a lot more.

01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:28.260
Thank you.

01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.960
Thank you.

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.660
Thank you.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:37.760
The, um, next model I'll come up with is the Apple 3.0.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.560
I think Apple 3.0 is high-end, and Apple 3.0,

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.280
which I think we're going to work toward,

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.280
you know, we're not going to be fighting a lot with,

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.220
but you know, I just want to say,

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:46.620
time another time another battery out.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:26:14.240
But sometimes your just
