00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
you've been doing, it's valuable and burns a lot of energy.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.640
So if you're going to have your business, you're going to want to build in a sense of

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.600
confidence because you're building your business to a point where it's going to burn a lot

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.600
of energy.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.800
That's what I'm talking about here.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.800
I think that the question of the literature is definitely one that I want to address.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.800
And I think that's why I'm showing you a collection of the new works that are coming out this year

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
of the US government and the US government.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.800
I think that the same thing that I'm going to tell you is that the literature is about people,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800
and it's not just about people.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.800
It's more about people.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
The public opinion of the American people is really important.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.800
and we've had a lot of good work that's been done.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.800
So we're really happy to be here.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.800
And if you have any questions,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.800
we're happy to be here.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800
And I think we're going to end it here.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.800
But if there's any questions you'd like to ask,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.800
please do so in the Q&A box.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.800
And I hope you enjoyed this.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.800
Thank you.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.800
Dr. Craig, do you want to tell

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.800
the audience about your project?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800
I think we're really looking

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
at how we're going to address

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.800
the current problems of COVID-19.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800
And if you have any questions,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.440
I think we've got around 30 questions.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.080
So if we could open and see who's getting questions.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.680
So and one of them was a question from John.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.600
Can I have one more question?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.000
I think you're in the dismissal game.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.120
So I'm going to read you a question that came in.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.380
So you're in the dismissal game.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.880
Yeah.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.400
And we've got 50 minutes, so we have two questions each time.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.540
So I have 15 questions.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.840
I think he's a very talented guy.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.440
And he's really, he's really really talented.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.640
So that's why I'm really interested in the book.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.180
Okay.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.000
Well we'll have to leave now.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.840
We don't have any time.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.440
Yeah.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.120
Please.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.540
Yes.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.840
This is a good question.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.880
And I'm really excited to share that I know

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.060
from you today you're very talented.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.580
But I think that you had a really great

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.620
presentation and I didn't get to talk to any of you.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.620
So I think we have a good chance to do it this year,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.620
because we're planning to do this.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.620
And then we can't wait to see our next project,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.620
and I know we can't wait to go back to the state.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.620
We'll see how we can do this.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.620
And I think we just need to get the money to be ready

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.620
to go forward and use our resources

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.620
and have those to go.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.620
And I think we've got a lot of time to go ahead

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.620
and get our next project done.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.620
So, thank you very much, Dr. Harnett.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.620
And thank you to all of our panelists

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.620
for taking the time to share with us

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.380
and the kind of things that you're seeing.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.620
And I think that's one of the things that I'm

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.160
just trying to get back to you.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.860
I think that the last thing that I

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.860
think is important to me is the fact

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.240
that we have a very strong focus on the state

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.860
for seeing how many of the people

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.900
that we have in the state, and how

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.900
the technologies of the state are doing

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.840
when you're doing this kind of thing.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.640
So I think that we're gonna have a lot of time

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.280
and we're gonna spend a lot of time

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.220
in a very short period of time

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.520
where we're gonna have to sort of

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.020
come up with more specific ideas

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.000
and we'll see what we can do.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.160
So if you're not sure what you're gonna do,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.100
we're gonna ask you,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.720
we're gonna ask two really great questions.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.160
What's your name?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.900
And we're gonna have to ask those questions

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.380
and yeah, I don't know if I've ever said to you that,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.540
I'm not sure if you've ever done something that's wrong

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.880
or not useful.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.560
in a process of transformation.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.760
And I really like that.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.100
And you, would you like to pick up on that?

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.800
Yeah, I have a question to you.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.880
And I'm not sure what the reason is.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.080
But I do know that a lot of people

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.400
were just trying to solve the problem,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.960
so the question is, how do we solve this problem?

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.800
And my first time was, I think, a problem

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.180
in the last five years or so, and it was just

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.240
a little past the goal.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.240
The two of them are both American-American veterans, and they are both a captain of the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.240
American-British Air Force in the United States, and they are both American-British veterans

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.240
in the United States.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.240
In the same way that the United States is a national organization, it is a national

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.240
organization, and it is a national organization.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.240
And that's not only what this agency does, it's also a national organization.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.440
and then sometimes they will come back and ask me to provide the treatment with the treatment that they need.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.440
So that's it.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.140
And the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to take the data out of the portal

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.140
and we're going to send it to the first-order hospital.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.140
So we're going to send this to the first-order hospital.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.940
And then at that point, we're going to go to another hospital that we have at home,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.940
and that's the one that we're going to be assisting.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.940
And then we added five and twenty and twenty-five percent of the total bills left on the next level.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.940
And this is the cost of the next year period.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.940
It's significant.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.940
So, there might be more corporations.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.940
We are going to have to look at more and more corporate companies, more and more.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.940
It's going to be a different kind of a relationship.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.940
I don't know why we're going to have this inter-company focus on six percent.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.940
Because, of course, we're going to have to follow these agreements.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.940
We're going to have to monitor the government.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.940
and they are still in the back end of the field,

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.940
and we are allowing them to stay in the camp camps.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.940
Thank you.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.940
Thank you, I can't remember if the opportunities are somewhere else,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.940
I think the issues.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.940
It's just like I said, getting out to the private level

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.940
is not such a big deal for us,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.940
but for us it's such a big deal in terms of the consistency

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.940
of the people that we are trying to get to,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.940
that's part of the reason for this project.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.940
So we really hope to get back to the full expectations

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.940
that we had to get to.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.940
Yes, thank you.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.940
State level was at a 2.5.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.940
And I'm not a technical statistic, I'm just going to try to add that a couple of times.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.940
But the state level was at a 2.5, and I was going to add 1.5 up to the end of the year,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.940
so I'm going to say that it was up to the end of the year, so I'm going to say that it was up to the end of the year.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.940
State level was at 6.5.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.940
I was in Texas with a 4.8.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.260
And I mentioned that the government signed it on May 24th and it's very successful.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.580
It's been a very successful commission.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.060
It's been a very successful commission.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:34.060
So we have all the local members registered to address the issue for security members

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.980
and our own media and members.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.900
So the key steps for our decision-making,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.380
and then the six-year-old, that's a four-year-old,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.080
I think that is a two-year-old, so that's a four-year-old.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.280
So, in the end, it's the other six-year-old

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.340
that's going to be the first major,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.420
that's going to be the first child.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.420
That's the only way that we can do it.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.680
If the one-year-old had a first baby,

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.060
if it's a four-year-old,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.820
well, that's not really something that's going to be

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.360
a particular question for the kids,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.320
because they're going to have to work.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.660
And sometimes, when you're dealing

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.800
I mean, there's only two times as much in the 40 minutes.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.500
But I think that, in fact, it's very, very much in the same definition

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.400
when it comes to the other type of data.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.040
And you see, I want to say that that is not really what we're trying to achieve

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.840
in this program.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.240
We're trying to achieve a kind of change in that world.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.020
And I'm sorry, it's really not the best idea.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.720
We want to try to put aside that and try to get away

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.260
one student from the student to the other student,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
depending on the person, depending on the class.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.180
And it can be done in a way or another,

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.680
but it makes sense that every student

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.360
could have a responsibility to do a social work.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.680
So for instance, if you only have

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.060
$25,000 or $26,000, that's $56,000.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.820
And then if you have $26,000, that's

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.360
$25,000, and you know that the person who does the work

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.860
So, basically, we're going to have to go with that.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:19.360
And this will be a pretty straightforward task, and it will change over the next amount

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.360
of time.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.360
It's possible to get this task going this month, and it's exactly what you're showing.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.360
I would like to mention, for that, I'm going to make a point that if you increase the decrease

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.860
in the number of people that are involved, the claims go back a lot, but the last one

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.860
and we're going to be at a certain extent in the United States,

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.860
not to the United States, but to the United States,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.860
because of the good news that we're doing in our city schools.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.860
Okay.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.860
So, on the second question,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.860
if our government is going to be able to oversight this problem,

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.860
we do know how to address it now.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.860
We're going to have to address it now,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.860
and this might be some of the crucial work that we've done,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.860
which is to take cases, take procedures,

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.860
and to start consulting at certain areas,

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.020
So I'm going to go over to the front of the slide.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.660
And I'm going to go through the information that's in the slides.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.180
And I'm going to go over to the front of the slide.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:18.940
So the reason we're discussing this is because we're going to be teaching this about that September 19th,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.980
when the National College of Engineering is going to be participating in the board meeting

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.420
in January, which is going to be in September.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.420
So we've got a lot of things we can do just to get things in exactly the same way.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.420
One of the things we can do is to take the time to think about the services or consumers

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.420
and look at the services that we're going to distribute.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.420
So we're not going to do it in a short period of time.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.420
And we'll do it in the next few months.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.420
And we're not going to take the time to look at the services or consumers.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.740
So, the question is, how can we prevent the use of cellulite from affecting our patients

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.980
and preventing them from getting the vaccine?

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.020
And then the other one is, is it a good thing or a bad thing?

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.020
It's a good thing.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:18.860
And then the other question is, how can we prevent mouse infections from affecting our patients?

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:24.460
And then, for the other question, how can we prevent the use of cellulite from affecting our patients?

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.460
And we are going to have a little bit of a discussion about how we can use this as a tool to help you.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:36.460
And we are going to take a look at our second show. So we're going to show you a little bit of what we can do.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:43.460
Okay. The second show will begin in one minute. And we are going to have a little discussion about how we can use this as a tool to help you.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.460
Okay. And we're going to push into the panel.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:54.460
Thank you.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.460
Thank you.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.460
We have 10 minutes with the time.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.460
I'll just ask if you would like to add anything.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.460
Okay.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.460
This is your question.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.460
In this first four years, our intersector, and the other intersector,

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.460
we have a different type of treatment.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.460
We are working on a new code that we have in the library for treatment.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.460
We have a new treatment that is a one-person program

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.460
that was intended to ensure that females could have it.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.460
That included the insurance method and medication

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.460
that our parents needed to have treatment,

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.460
and also the health care unit plans.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.260
At number three on the first page we have two different people.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
They are Ruth and Stuart.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.660
And they have been studying for 40 years.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.260
So this is the first year that we've been doing this project.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.460
And I think they are two.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.660
And this is the first year that we've been doing this project.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:53.460
And that takes the right amount of time for the university to be able to do this project.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.860
And I hope you enjoy this project.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.160
and then, um, every day, we call it a day.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.260
So your next day is a state-run week, so it's a very, very important day.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.460
So I'm hoping you're understanding the value,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.460
the amount of work that you need to accomplish,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.960
uh, and the amount of work you can focus on,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.460
and where you're going to go to in the next six days.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.060
And then I'd like to bring up some of these, uh,

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.060
purchase notes for us, and to all the education adults

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.460
who have published those, we have two calls,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.460
one is worth $20,

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.460
and another one is for G-Date support.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.460
and uh, policies for the world, change the climate by its limits.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.960
And actually, yes, there will be a difference in climate

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.960
to a really interesting way of learning about climate change and how to do it.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.960
And I just want to welcome you to the panel.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.960
Uh, that is the final, uh, presentation so far.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.960
It's going to be seven minutes, please keep counting.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.960
Uh, four hundred and seventy-one minutes.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:57.960
Um, so the mission was basically to, um, get a few ancestors to be able to go back to their home,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:04.960
um, and then also, um, to, uh, help us make more, uh, special donations.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:15.960
So, I'm currently working on the F-1-2-3-6 project, and it marks, uh, our early days in the functional infrastructure for the, uh, for the district.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.960
And, we will...

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.960
We will keep it there.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.960
And, we will change the view to a new, that has art and project people.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.960
And, that's not a good idea.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.960
So, I'm going to change the view to that.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.960
That is for a new project.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.960
So, I'm going to change the view to this.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.960
And, this project is for a new project.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.960
to the education of students with disability,

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.960
which is why I'm saying this.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.960
This group will provide a structure

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.960
in which both the families and the students

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.960
can stay to be in a different classroom

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.960
for a few students.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.960
And it will help to stay in a different classroom

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.960
for a few students.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.960
And I'd like to point out that we recently received

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.960
an emergency emergency help

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.960
and our health program is a digital health grant program.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.960
Now if our health program doesn't have more users than 80,000,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:22.960
this program is going to work perfectly fine to navigate and move forward in the next 50 years.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.960
And the last one is, the Department of Health and Human Services Commission does serve patients and parents.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.960
That package for kids is sponsored through the government and the government.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.720
And we have different ways to do that.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.000
And we'll start with the age.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.120
Our young children with the most significant age is

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.320
one year old.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.000
So we'll start with the age.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.920
So we'll start with the age.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.680
The last, the last thing that we have

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.200
is the perfect risk and the best skill in school education

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.800
rate, the H-R-E-T.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.600
So the H-R-E-T is for children from the most

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.000
relevant age group at each school.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.640
That means that if you work at the school,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.140
We have a full test and a test in attending.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.340
We have a full review of the students and also we will have

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.140
a little bit of a quick question and answer session.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.340
When is this important?

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.140
Is it in Canada or in the US?

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.340
2.1 million dollars.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.340
Do people want to submit their questions?

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.040
We want to know what point they've come to.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.140
Another one in the corner.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:34.140
And the correct area of take is the I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:40.140
It is the EF and it defines the percent elevation for a maximum level of energy.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.140
We then how we classify our energy into the distance.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.140
That is more on a website.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.140
And then we refi- we pick it to our post價,

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.140
and we refi- we refer to our EF.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:57.140
And our constant values are 20-30, which is what the current values are.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:03.540
And this point is what Christmas is and what we need and what we can work with to do and

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:08.240
what is the last thing we can do for Christmas and what is Christmas and Christmas is about

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.140
and what Christmas is about and what Christmas is about. So, I'm going to go forward to

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.540
the end of the opportunity and turn it into the end of the presentation.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.740
And then I'm going to go over to my table for a few minutes.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.940
Texas, total, two national holidays.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.340
The first was winter and then autumn.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.740
Now you're in December and it's still autumn.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.740
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I'm really late on the right format.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.740
Your information response skill section has the same name as your certificate.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.740
This can be used to give you the description of the program and the features,

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.740
or to give you the basic uses of your certification.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.740
There is any more questions?

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.640
before we got started, I want to give you the total, 532 million dollars is the total

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.200
the total cost of living here?

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:57.840
8.4.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.540
8.4 billion.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.440
8.4 billion.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:06.240
And if you think of it in a total, 532 million dollars is the total cost of living in here.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.780
Which is pretty partial.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.420
And 5.9 million dollars is the total cost of living right here.

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.220
And we're going to go into the ones that are left.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:22.740
We work with our knowledge signal developer. We do work with our local and local resources.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.740
We have a lot of our emerging companies, and that's where we're working on the project.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.740
So, that's it.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.740
And that's the community development tool.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.740
And that is the section of the...

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.740
So, that's the new slide.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.740
Yes.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.740
The new...

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.740
Which is the new slide, the new one that I just saw.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.740
that we can do some kind of a solution for community service

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.740
to help our communities.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.740
And I'm thinking about, you know,

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.740
some of the problems we're in.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.740
And I would like to show you,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.740
and this is an idea I've been thinking about,

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.740
is how we're pulling that traditional investment

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.740
from the interest aspect

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.740
and we're trying to really get the money

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.740
and the money into the community.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:14.740
Well, to talk about cancer, when we were first in the race, we had a very different thing.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:21.740
We wanted to know what we wanted to do with the cancer, and then we decided to call for a new cancer.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:28.740
And after the doctor came in, we called for a new one, and so we passed what we knew,

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.740
which was a chemotherapy, and it was pretty much healthy and sensitive.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:38.740
And we want to explore, especially with the concept of experiments doing the data,

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.740
because we know that everything is going to have effects.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.740
And we ask, what can we do to make the responses really helpful to the earth world?

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:52.740
And we also said that we have to do the research, and we are now making the data.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.740
So, thank you.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:10.460
Okay.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:17.160
Teri, you wanted to talk about,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.420
the things DAYHAPENING has done,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.420
and continue to help to help my home out in the United States.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.420
We are almost a day away from that.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:32.420
And, I guess, we're doing just a little bit cheaper.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.420
I think we will stop at this one, don't we?

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.420
We did state library.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.420
What's that over there?

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.420
We've got a little for our next student.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.420
So, we're going to leave that at that.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.420
We're going to leave that at that.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.420
So, we're going to leave that at that.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:56.420
I just wanted to make mention that I am a professor of engineering at the University of New York, and I'm a graduate student.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:03.420
So I'm very happy that I get to be here because we're so happy that I can be here and sort of make the world a better place.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:10.420
And I'm also very happy that we have two major assets with our student department, and that's the first that we took in.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:17.700
so that we are very intentional about the rights we're pursuing in supporting our fellow

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.620
athletes in this war in Korea.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.900
Can you talk about the U.S. security case?

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.300
The U.S. security case?

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.900
Well, the South Korean National Security Agency, they didn't specifically update the

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.300
U.S. security law on the U.S. security law.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:40.180
And coping is a little different. We, we, we're able to take this from a family who didn't

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.820
produce a lot of property, but I would say, in a conversation, say, I need this for my

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.580
program, I need this for my program, I can't ask for this, I can't spend the money. So

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.500
there's a little difference in coping and that, and that is really important. I think

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:58.020
it is really important that that's a factor into my, my, my ability to work with families

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.540
on, on, on the same level that our faculty is getting that help.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.880
that we can record for the students,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.620
but then we can record for the students

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.480
and have it with the slide up that comes.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.300
And then also record our progress

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.980
of the previous and our previous evaluation data

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.840
as far as how we see this code after we complete our progress.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.300
Also, we have a very comprehensive

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.900
algorithm that we use.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.700
What is your application for that?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.780
I want to know what was it that you found.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.880
And I need to make sure that I'm looking at the results.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.280
and I just want to say thank you very much.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.280
This is a very interesting topic.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.280
Thank you.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280
Thank you.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.280
Thank you.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280
Thank you.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.280
Thank you.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.280
Thank you.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.280
Thank you.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.280
Thank you.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.680
So, in the end, the way that we will try to work with you is kind of a global work

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.680
on the internet.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.680
As we speak at this event, we should talk with you, and we'll have a conversation about

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.680
the data that's been provided in the comments box just in time.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:02.680
We continue to work on many of our activities and we're going to continue to work on that.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.880
One thing that we're going to do is we're going to have this on the security of our

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.880
students.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:15.680
And we're going to try and work through the preparation groups and the technical information

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680
group.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.680
We're going to have a lot of information on how we're going to engage students and how

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.180
and doing the same thing in the same places,

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.620
call for help and call for help,

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.360
not because we're going to do something,

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.700
but because there are some changes to the plans

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.860
in the supply and the supply chain,

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.300
and in our own market.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.340
And if it means that we're not actually

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.400
going to do so sometimes,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.640
it doesn't mean that absolutely not.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.640
It just means that this website will have to impact them.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.640
I'm the head of the training team here at the University of California.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:58.640
So we want to continue to accept this opportunity and so there's a gap between the two.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.640
The policy of education and the fact that I just quit with the military and then I was

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.640
working with the Army and so on.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.640
So it's not that we can't do it anymore.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.640
There's a perfect opportunity to do something different.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.140
Yeah.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:14.640
Yeah.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.880
And does it really have to apply to this way of thinking

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.380
as well?

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:18.880
Yeah.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.380
Yeah.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:19.880
Yeah.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.380
Yeah.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.180
Of course, it's working.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:21.680
It's working.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.460
So I'm going to leave it at that.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.760
I mean, certainly, I think we've

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.640
got some of the stories here.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.260
Let's say, for example, it depends, again,

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.840
because you've got to think about this multiple

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.340
of places.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.020
And you really get to look at this, which

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.580
is just ending it.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.400
And we would really have to determine what

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.800
the point that, as a matter of fact, this is something that we are doing and we have

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.840
a change in policy and our plan is perfect. So, I would determine that these are going

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.960
to be put back on disposal at that point in time.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.640
So, I think that's a good point, too. I think it's going to be a very important cost.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.400
I think that's really important.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.600
Thank you.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:09.440
So, well, we are moving to conclude this report, which is tonight, and I hope you have a great

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.440
Well, if you're writing a movie, you're not going to get the position you want to get,

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.440
because that's really hard.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.440
So, how do you do that?

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.440
Well, I think it's a very easy method.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.440
Yes, so what we do is we have a screen, and you can go back to it, and then we make two

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.440
big dots.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:34.440
And, for the dots, we have a factor vector, and the solution is how to do the ending sequence

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:40.440
up the C-section of the body and we would turn to the stand and stretch out of place.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.440
If you're wondering what you're doing, I'll show you how I do it.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.440
I'm focusing on the standpoint of the change that we can focus on.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.440
Thank you.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.440
Thank you very much for the opportunity to

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.440
report to the head of the land as well as the person in front of me,

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.440
Mr. R. Kelly.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.440
I requested to spend some time back and

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.440
just to take in their mind and

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.440
to repay the existing fees of

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.440
the new home purchase while the other floor had to sit here.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.740
What is the ability to design and deal with the quality of the product?

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.240
So, the product has some different examples.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:35.540
So, of course, there's, um, some of the styles, safety, and, um, what's your,

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.740
what's your advice on how to work with the product?

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.540
What's your advice on how to work with the product?

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:47.540
Um, the question is, I have a friend who works on, um, the, uh, with green glasses.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.540
If you have a different one, it's okay to ask me.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:57.340
It is a best practice, um, and if you ask me to not ask them, um, I do.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.340
Yeah, I think you know what I'm talking about.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.340
I think you know what I'm talking about.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.340
Yeah, I think I get it.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:09.340
And so, um, if you ask me what I can do, I'll think about it and I'll, you know, tell you what I should be able to do and what I shouldn't.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.340
Okay.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.340
Alright.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.340
Thanks, man.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.340
Thank you.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.340
I'm going to move the camera around.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.340
This is a really wonderful festival.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.340
Thanks for coming, thank you.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.340
So, I'm going to go around the table and thank you, services.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:46.340
So, again, I'm not the best person to have a problem with, but I'm a good person to work with.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:52.340
I get reached out, I'll make sure I work with somebody else, I'm not biased.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:56.340
I'm not, if you want to protect me, protect me.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.340
I'm not a big, I'm not a big deal.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.340
I'm not a cheater, I'm not a good leader.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.740
and then everything that's like climbing up and going up,

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.940
but also it's just, you know,

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.540
it's like 3 to 4% of the people are small.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.540
So, the problem has been the change to the gear,

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.940
and the more I've been able to say this is the problem,

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.940
the more I've been able to say this is the problem,

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.140
and I feel like I'm losing it.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.840
But, I think I'm going to just go with the person.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.340
Thank you.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.340
Thank you.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:35.340
Okay, I'm just going to take a few minutes and then I'll get you on the other one.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:40.340
Okay, I'm going to take a few minutes.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.340
Hi, I'm Ashley, I'm from the City of San Diego.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.340
Hi, I'm Ashley Brown, I'm the head of the Public Health Bureau.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.340
The first thing I want to explain is the service that we provide.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.340
The central campaign is a local care.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.340
This is a national organization, so it's not a national organization,

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.340
but we have a traditional wording that we put together as well.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:07.340
So, just to, so we actually needed to get a pretty good version of it, we needed a lot of this,

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:12.340
I think more of a different style of work, we needed a different presentation, but in section one,

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:17.340
we turned out to, I think, a couple of things. So, I came up with a particular title for the

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:25.340
book, and I intended to be, it was really a change to the current presentation, and it worked

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:31.340
So, this is the first formality is the universal school, the digital universal school,

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.340
the digital campus for arts and programs and all.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:38.340
And then the other formality is for arts community,

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.340
which means the town or arts community,

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.340
which means the institution or the place,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.340
and the institution or the school.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.340
And that is not really a difficult thing to do.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.340
But, in fact, actually the, the first one was on the

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.340
on the day of the conference, and it was important to say that

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.340
because of the program, and, and the public training program

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.340
particularly was a part of the water quality and the student

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:07.340
services. Those are actually the most heavily, you know, student

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.340
under my service, and most of them get to do this course.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.340
And so, that's exactly what the policy was about, that we

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.340
could, and we should be able to do this work that way.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.340
and it's a good, good question.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.340
Thank you.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.340
We have two more questions.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.140
The first is from

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.140
Lauren, which is a traditional

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.140
drink that we drink.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.140
We have one who says

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.140
it's odd that in Thailand

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.140
we have the same drink

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.140
used to drink in ourselves

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.140
as time was over.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.140
Is the name of the drink

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.140
from the foreign country

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.140
or from the US?

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.140
So we're going to explore and try to work that out.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.140
And I think that's something that I've been out to do for a really long time.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:56.140
So, I'm going to start off by asking, how do you feel about the new regulations changing

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.140
and how do you think the law changes in Australia in the next few years?

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.140
Thank you, Sue.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.140
Thank you.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:07.140
And, um, I think that we're really, I mean, we're definitely going to have to try and

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.620
and I have done a lot of critical thinking about what

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.960
we're going to see in the future.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.540
So I don't know.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.580
I don't know how to answer this.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.880
I don't think it's a good sound.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.220
I don't know if she can hear me.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:17.720
I don't know.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.220
I don't know.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:18.720
I don't know.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.220
I don't know.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:19.720
I don't know.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.740
So that is a question that is really

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.920
a problem with what we're talking about.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.220
But we are in a very, very, very important

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.360
and very, very, very, very important

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.580
and very, very important to us.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.140
And I think that's what we need to do.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.900
All right, let's move, what is it?

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.900
Is it a Janitorial?

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.100
Janitorial, yes.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.900
Janitorial, and a Janitorial and a Magulis.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.460
So, Janitorial, the policy is from...

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.940
Janitorial, but a Janitorial from a wine company.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.140
Janitorial from a wine company.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.140
So, I mean, that's a lot.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.180
I mean, you've heard of the jail in the United Kingdom and you've been using the term in California,

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.580
and the participants get more and more progress in their training.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:15.660
And so basic progress in training is awareness, really is not only learning the same things

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:22.940
as you, but also learning the devices, the opportunities, and the different elements

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.780
of our learning performance.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.980
And we're very happy to answer any questions that you have for us today.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.980
and we have a plan to help you.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.980
So, let me just give you a little bit of a list of the things that we do.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:39.980
We do a lot of research on the world-class effects of UTC presidential data,

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.980
and information researches, and we have a whole bunch of historical events together.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.980
We do a lot of research on security and social strategies.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:54.980
We do a lot of training on security policy and security policy today,

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.580
And so if you can look at that, that would be a little detail page.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.180
You know, you can look at the information page and see what's going on.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:08.380
So let's go over to the information.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.580
So it's information that must be protected.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:17.780
So it's a normal rights, judicial action, or public access based on state or federal law.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.380
And it has a legal agreement.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:23.780
And that is going to be taken to the Supreme Court to ensure that it works.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:33.780
So you want to protect your identity. I don't think I have the personally identifiable information.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:42.780
Most things can include a name, a social security number, the address, the number you just used to identify,

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:53.580
where there's main name, uh, magnetic, um, information, such as fingerprint, um, uh, model codes, um,

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:58.540
so like you should access the buses and this is where you need, um,

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.540
funding for, um, deaf and hard of hearing and deaf and hard of hearing services.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.540
You see this map here, okay.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:14.540
Okay, we also need to check our security information. We want that if any information is needed

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:20.540
to breach the data systems, we're protecting for controls via CTC.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:28.540
That comes with the original credentials. We want the information, data information regarding

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:40.540
the structure and the configuration of security for the controls that we have for CTC, making policies and procedures needed to gain access to the resources,

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:49.540
and to make sure both person and client sequence, intellectual policy, and certain types of research data.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:59.540
And if you have information left, CTC would like to take that away to a public information, to the government.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:06.540
And so, the South Texas and the other different national resources can be downloaded.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:10.540
And we will bring things to that connection to the Washington State Council,

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:17.540
have the people step in it, regulations and mandates according to the National Government Information Resources.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:30.540
The first step is to give them acceptable practices of education, both before and after, and to educate individuals on what to do with or some security training you have to do,

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:35.540
and to give them a fair and open-fronted support for the student and the other student.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.540
So understanding economic rates and deprivation security risk.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:51.540
Okay. If you use this as one of the positive points in your health information research,

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:59.540
some of these risks can include, if you have a social change, and you are trying to take

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:06.540
all the information into, hopefully, professional disclosure, those things have to be intentional.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:13.540
And this one's fast. And it's also intellectual property theft.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:18.540
And other operations are antics.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.540
And what is that?

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:27.540
Intangible contracts of human potential damage.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.540
And intellectual loss.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:34.540
And then intellectual and chemical services.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:43.540
and our compliance firms and other essential and regulatory agencies.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:50.540
And I think somebody wants to hear, we really want to get reach to the individual.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.540
Do we want to do a whole big project group?

00:35:53.540 --> 00:36:03.540
and um, so we always um, um, we did have some of the problems that we found out, but the

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.540
type of thing happened in a way that we didn't think that it did happen. But um, people turned

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:13.540
on all of these great things, didn't have so much information about our system. And

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:18.540
um, that's where we um, we did not have um, not any confidential information about the

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.540
and also make sure you have control of the activity.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.540
So getting my phone here, the initials here in Linux

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.540
is going to put my name in the top right corner of the board.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.540
The I-shape is going to be my settings,

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.540
or I'll be in the desktop.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.540
The devices are closed,

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.540
and the system must be on an acceptable level

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.540
and having an issue in Linux.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:52.540
So we're going to have the screen, um, um,

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:57.540
the little, um, type of software that you can see out there.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.540
It has aspects of the buttons on your devices.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.540
Um, our users will have changes to their own, like, image,

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.540
um, when they have to switch in.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:11.540
And also, um, they will have more to be used for, um,

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.540
to enterprise systems and business systems.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:22.540
In the computer, you actually have something under IT and it tells us the code and then

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.540
we have the data in the right direction.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:39.540
So, your license conditions are related to contract documents or image templates on IT.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:44.340
But in some cases, some subjects have to do with their license, and on the common common,

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.740
that would be a reduction of system, such as a ratio.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:57.740
So, we're going to be licensing the frequency levels, such as the top is 65,

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:03.740
we do the R3, it's using that, and that is usually licensed by each department.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.740
What is a paid software?

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.740
It is a really intensive stack of tools.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:20.740
A few of these are those software that focuses on recording for one user and recording from the top service.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.740
And then they access all of your data.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:31.740
To all of these, these folks are able to use your technology to participate in really great journeys.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.820
And I would like to have a conversation with you about how to get yourself ready to meet

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:39.020
your household or life and meet the kids out there.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:44.060
So, you can get in touch with me and I'll see you in the next video presentation.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.340
So, we have some different types of business models for our systems system.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:59.980
And when they do have a systems system, they do help people through cyber security training.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:04.980
We have to have a legitimate educational or business purpose to be our assistance.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:11.980
That is to provide the education that we always need to be having the education for any policy

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.980
and provide a pivotal position on the institution's part.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:20.980
And in that way, the TACS was just a data that we were interested in.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:31.980
So what are some of the best applications that you can use for integration resources?

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:41.980
They can include machine experience, machine, machine, machine, and machine.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.980
So of course we have done the same.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:51.980
So we are going to be just the right that you should come to the HMNC now.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:58.980
They are going to be trying to take you into the discovery of propositions of information

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:04.980
which are going to be used in most of the public data.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.980
or they saw the virtual IT or

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.980
um,

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.980
uh,

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.980
group vendors,

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:11.980
I mean,

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.980
well,

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:13.980
they can be the same age,

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.980
they can be from different directions,

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:15.980
or they can do different things,

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.980
or,

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:17.980
you know,

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.980
we,

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.980
you can get,

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.980
um,

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.980
some people,

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:22.980
they look at the computer,

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.980
they give us their information,

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.980
some people,

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:25.980
they can go out there and fix it,

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.980
you know,

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.980
I know lots of other people

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:28.980
who have been training,

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.980
or all these other people,

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:30.980
who teach right now,

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.980
um,

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.980
teaching,

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.980
we would ask for,

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.580
So if you have a T-Mobile, probably only works for 12 minutes or so.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.580
Either your password.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.580
And then you ask what is your password.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:48.580
So you can have passwords that happen to be on your devices.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.580
And whatever your strong name is, you will get an update.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:59.580
And things like that, you know, there's no other way to let this go off.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.980
It's absolutely impossible to get this corrected.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:10.980
If you can get one of these in your house or in your home, if you have, if you're going to be late for something like that, then just go put it on your detention center search.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:19.980
So, as far as this is unique, one of the big, I mean, I've had a busy time with, you know, some of the different departments we've gone out to,

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:26.980
but we do research, and we have a specific individual that we're going to be asking for help with.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.980
So, if you're interested, what could be the most successful business you could expect?

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:37.980
And then this is a comparison to our initial location here.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.980
And this is the location that we are going to be visiting in the future.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.980
And this is the location that we are going to be visiting in the future.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:50.980
So for our final location, it's a two-week start. It's a two-week day.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:55.980
So do you want to make sure that it's there in the week?

00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:00.460
Is that email, on the internet, the most you're expecting, the email,

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:05.740
uh, what about my dick message, my email, what's my email address, which is the region that I'm from,

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:11.420
again, I'm from the United Kingdom, so I suggest to, to the best of our ability to email that,

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.380
before you do that, reach out to the public news.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:23.100
Um, because they could lead you to, um, a website, or the internet, or, um, there's a virus,

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:29.100
or lead to other activities to actually give them safety and assessment.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.100
Okay.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:37.100
So there are also these people who can update your score on the internet.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:42.100
They can actually search through web updates or your apps that you have over here.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:48.100
They also can search through web links of your iOS or your physical education levels.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:54.100
So the other ones that I'm going to show you, this is the one I'm using.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.100
And this is the one that I'm going to use right now.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:04.100
Using the phone, I'm going to show you a little more of my own way to try and contact you to get your personal information.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:09.100
Or just to shoot with slaves, you can ask the mark signer to take a message to Mr. Lifford.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.100
And of course, I can give you a line to do your call.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:18.100
So there's a conversation probably bigger form of the site name, obviously.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.100
The website's been closed for 23 months.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:30.100
And to come to your surface support and get any help at all is really the most late to

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.100
the work that's taking place right now.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.100
So I'm very excited about that.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.100
Thank you.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.100
Thank you.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:43.460
And then, um, a discussion on the type of statistics and the location of topics to answer the actual

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:49.380
important questions. Um, so if I'm not used to the local traffic conditions and things like that,

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:54.260
I'm actually going to use YouTube. And again, it's easy to go into the online world,

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.100
if you're not around to do that.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.100
Okay.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:04.260
Yeah, probably. Um, because we're not actually doing web sites, you know, we work

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.260
So, I'm going to start with a table here, and I'm going to go to the definition, the

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.260
initial project, and I'm going to start with the terms.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.260
So, I'm going to start with initial terms, and I'm going to put in the names.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:20.260
Okay, so this is an example here.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:24.260
What this means is that you're filling out the names of the buildings you're accessing,

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:29.260
and you're checking the data search, but the different websites are available.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.260
And then, once you've done all of that, you're going to go to the webinar page here.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:42.380
I think if you're sure that you're going to be able to do it, let's say in July, if you're

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:48.060
at this point in time that you're going to be able to go out there and just associate

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:53.020
with that list for research, and if you're going to have a lot of time to do one or three

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:57.580
things on this list, make sure you have a respectable, comfortable, honest list.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.900
Try to make sure that you've been sure that you're going to be able to do a report after

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.900
and actually the difference in the right side.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.900
In this production we have some sort of second stage.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:18.900
We have found that activists, farmers,

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.900
federal groups, nation states,

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:24.900
and for these are some of those,

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.900
we have some of our best sponsors.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:34.900
and the one thing that can change is the weather conditions.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:39.900
It could be rain, it could be a tropical day,

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:44.900
especially the last day of the year is always a perfect day, isn't it?

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:49.900
It could be heat, it could be, you know, a natural situation.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:58.900
I'll just go ahead. There are a lot of times people that go out there and they do this,

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:03.900
just because they can do that. And if you can't do this, just throw this out for them.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:10.900
So one single product, one unit, one product, one product. So we can't just kind of stay

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.900
a bit too long or too long. So we can't do that.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:24.900
We have many different things, we have these products from TMI, from SMS, we have the

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.900
many different devices.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.900
I'm sure all of you have seen our desk, we've seen that and they've got lots of stuff on

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.900
it, so I'm sure you'll be very well free.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:41.900
I can tell you that we also have a project with Goa here and I'm really looking forward

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:49.100
the discussion we've been taking, and we've clicked on its links, we wanted to have some

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:54.460
about something that they would call, as I'm afraid, the lead person of things, so they

00:46:54.460 --> 00:47:00.540
could have an opportunity to do that. And so, we were working on a new idea, actually

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:06.940
last week, so we decided to create this new section, which was in a particular email that

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:12.940
to be true, to be able to see that, to all of these results have the same.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:19.940
There is a particular email that's circulating on Facebook that has these links that you can go to and read.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.940
This is for a very good policy.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:33.940
So far I've been seeing that this is a completely new, or totally new speaker.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.940
to work together to make sure that they're appropriate.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.940
And I'll take you down a little bit each week

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.940
so that we can talk through the data plan and policies.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.940
The websites and applications list provide what you need

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.940
for the next few years of the new policy.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.940
The ability for activity and learning functions

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:56.940
is the ability to switch your site

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.940
and is subject to all the other members.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:11.940
And make sure that the terminal RCTC services access data in the app are placed in the community or elsewhere

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:18.940
for the client to be able to take a file from and send it to the original service, and the service will send it to the network.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.940
I'm just going to go back to the presentation.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.940
Here it is.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.940
Okay.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.940
Make sure that the other button,

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.940
that button is suggesting that sometimes you're listening to the data,

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.940
but I'm going to leave that blank.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.940
Make sure that the combination of the two,

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.940
the photo-translator and the hard-to-experiment network,

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.940
is in particular important.

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:50.300
And I went from a sign of trust to a claim of discord and the importance of the state of

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.300
the country's institutions.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.300
And it's a very nice thing to do.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.300
I wish that was more to do with any of the reports.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:04.620
But if you can see, the word I'm referring to is the government has already given me

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.740
the right to watch.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.780
I don't see it.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.580
I don't want to hear it.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.020
I'm trying to get it out of here.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:16.540
So basically, these are all the things you want to work with and it's great to have them

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.540
for you.

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:26.340
And the second thing we want to do is we want to make sure that you have a really good license

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:32.140
and you want to make sure that you have a lot of things that are fast-tracked.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:37.260
So if you're going to do a business, you want to make sure that your business is fast-tracked

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:43.260
and your market working model, do you change that? Do you have to do that?

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:48.260
If you have any feedback you can leave a comment below and we'll get to that for you.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:53.260
So that way we can, you know, if you have anything to say to someone else,

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:58.260
that would be great. We'll take that to the expert. We're here to deal with your ads.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.260
And also, I think for me, if you're on a follow up on your system,

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.260
system you are in, what system you're in, and getting big, poor, and stale products.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:12.260
I say well, like, features are there, and we use them to enable a lot of the benefits

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:16.260
either in forever, or never, or if we are not in phase.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.260
And, say, if the process is not as good as it is.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:27.260
So, I'm wondering that I can then express what you think about the kind of

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:33.860
the situation that we don't know. So it's a good point, you know, it's a good replacement

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:42.260
for that device. I know that there are people that have apps that are able to access your

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:48.660
device through the Wi-Fi and so, you know, you're not a public service. You might want

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:54.260
to have those devices. So you're going to need to be able to not watch and just be at

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.860
So we're going to look at the same way we do it in the bathroom.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:02.240
And we're going to use a manual path, but I'm going to use a little bit of a turning

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.860
wheel so I don't know if that will do it.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.900
But I'm going to use two turns, and I'm going to go in a way that matters.

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.160
And we're going to actually go in a way that works, and I'm going to go in a way that works

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:10.660
for it.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:16.660
And so I'm trying to get the habit of seeing this thing move on the side, and it's always

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.660
like this, and it's like trapping and things like that.

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:26.060
So, here you have all your phone number and password numbers.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:32.880
And the other thing we'll add is that we have two voice apps.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:39.920
And the reason why we put these is so that when you watch, you can get to the front end.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:46.700
So, the easiest way to do that is that, you know, if you're not looking for that device anymore,

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:52.700
and you actually go out to review a reshot which writes all the information that's on the website

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.700
and that will be pulled by the student and they can go to work

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:05.700
so the protection model that I'm going to explain

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.700
it's a tool that's right here on the website

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:14.700
and it's also a branch that you will have there and what we've made in the spring

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.700
So you have computers.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.700
The test needs to do a test on the network.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:24.700
So the test needs to do multiple network interactions, so it's sort of like a blackface.

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:29.700
The test needs to do a test on the internet, for example.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:34.700
And the test needs to do it on the internet, even more often, it's really close to the parents.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:39.700
So it's really not a lot of data, and it's mostly just a little bit of access.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:43.700
So, I'll just give you a tip for the night.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:48.700
Go out for a walk, go out for dinner, and keep track of your textbooks,

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.700
which is what I'm going to do.

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:55.700
And what they're doing is they're trying to execute the topic that I'm going to teach you.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.700
So, I'm going to show you some examples of the facts, the evidence, and some facts.

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:04.700
And I'm basically going to teach you how to write a letter to your colleague,

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.700
and how to tell them.

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:11.200
So, go to a particular website, and then from there, turn to your cell phone, and it's become

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:16.200
a full-time job at the school team, and it's a really good area for it.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:20.200
And, um, read somewhere.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:24.200
So, when it's period in the computer, and you're all trying to place a book, it's set

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.200
there, and you're going to try to read something, and then you'll read stuff.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:33.200
So, I mean, I think a lot of times, I've tried that to go with peer-to-peer, and I've

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.600
you're supposed to be learning the values of that. So not just be a part of your general

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:42.400
life. People don't disagree with this. We're just building on our own ideas.

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:51.200
And this is how we're going to install something that actually is effective. So we'll just

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:57.200
pull this. And we'll turn the key on and start it up. And I'll just pull the key back on

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:03.200
So, for example, if you're going to submit a new script, and if you're, um, um,

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:09.200
I've got some stuff, some math, and some, like, I've got a storage, um, application,

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.200
and then you have your object.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.200
If you want to do your script, and you want to do your object,

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.200
you have to actually make a prompt, and you have to sort of authenticate the text,

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.200
and then you have to update.

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:26.200
And anybody who's so focused, they will put that back to the report.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.720
being heard very actively on the computer side of things.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:35.560
Another thing that might happen to you is that other indicators, especially the one

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:40.040
that's on the top of the screen, the two of those ones, if you can have some of that

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:45.400
data flow back down, that would generally be for advertising, using the different forms

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.240
of activity that you're using.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.280
Any questions?

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:58.680
Yes, moving on to a point we like to make for a broad class test on the data issue for health

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:03.920
care. So you can find units that you can do, you know, to help with the low income, low

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:09.280
income, low income, low income, low income, low income, low income, low income, low income,

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:14.000
low income, low income, low income, low income, low income. If that would be one approach

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.640
But it's not.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.160
I'm not convinced.

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.080
But I'll try to deal with it.

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.380
But it's probably too late to do that right now.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.260
Is that all?

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:26.760
Yeah.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.600
Yeah, that's all.

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.680
That's all I have.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.920
Yeah, that's all I have.

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.640
But I am trying to make it a bit easier

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.420
for us to be able to do this in a way

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.700
that's more actually more effective and more

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:40.000
exhausting than anything I've done in a long, long time.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:40.800
I appreciate that.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.240
And I'm trying to work on it.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.240
and then you'll be a citizen.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.800
And then, when they start talking about it,

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.040
it's not really a question.

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:51.040
But in fact, you're not actually the point.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.620
I'm not in a position to say that's not the point.

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.940
So it's not a point to ask questions.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.860
But the point is, I am a citizen.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.500
And I'm not just a citizen.

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.920
But it is not a question.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.240
And I think, probably, we are in this different world.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.260
And I think that there is a common ground

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:10.000
for the service mission of the civil service.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.600
I think that's the only thing that we want to do.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.840
I think that's pretty much what we want to do.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.280
So what's the next step?

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.680
The next step is to publish some of the data

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:22.180
and some of the other things, which

00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:23.500
the computer has to do.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.620
If you can't do it, then you can use .com.

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:30.400
The computer has to do that for the other person

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.360
in the second team.

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.500
And the computer has to do that way.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.100
And I think that's just a little bit of a cut-out.

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:40.000
So we have a data source that we want to publish.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.760
We're not going to be trying to explain it to you.

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.760
We're not going to.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:43.760
That's just me.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.260
No.

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.160
You have an email.

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.600
We're just trying to put you in a place where we're not going to say that we're not

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.040
returning your information.

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.040
I don't think it's fair.

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.040
So we're going to do a lot of explaining.

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.040
It's not just normal.

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.040
We're going to do it.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.040
Okay.

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.040
Thanks, Matt.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.040
No worries.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.040
No worries.

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.040
Thanks.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.040
Thank you very much.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.040
No problem.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.040
Thanks.

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.040
I'm sorry, I'm going to get in the way.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.040
I'm recording some things.

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:11.320
coordination days. Short recessions, which is basically kind of long recessions where

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:20.760
you have a short recessions that have several key things, like what is the KK and so the

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:25.000
number of recessions, the number of recessions, the number of recessions, the number of recessions,

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.560
and then you have the direct reports for the original states, the transfer, the current

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:31.360
and the people who are down for the case,

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.560
and to the members and to the judges.

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:40.560
So, I'm excited to see what kind of action

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.060
we're going to pull up for the court,

00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:45.560
for the court of justice, for the court of the judges.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.560
So, I'm excited to see what we're going to do

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.560
and what kind of action we're going to do.

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.560
So, thank you.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.180
you

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.180

7, 8, 7.20.

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:02.400
Yeah.

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:02.900
Yeah.

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:03.400
Yeah.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.060
Yeah.

01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:04.560
Yeah.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.800
So, good job, guys.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.160
I'm gonna throw it back to you.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.560
Everybody, let's do it.

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:15.100
2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2, 1, and 2, 1, 2, 2, 1.

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.600
Let's go.

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:17.100
Yeah.

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:17.600
Yeah.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.320
Yeah.

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:18.820
Yeah.

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.480
Yeah.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:19.980
Yeah.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:20.480
Yeah.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:20.980
Yeah.

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:21.480
Yeah.

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:21.980
Yeah.

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:22.480
Yeah.

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:22.980
Yeah.

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:23.480
Yeah.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:23.980
Yeah.

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:24.480
Yeah.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:24.980
Yeah.

01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:25.520
I think we got it.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:26.020
We got it.

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:26.520
We got it.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.020
We got it.

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:27.480
Yeah.

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:27.980
Yeah.

01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:28.480
Yeah.

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:33.180
So we're going to have to have a new conference yet coming into about two weeks in order to

01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:35.180
get it to work.

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:35.680
All right.

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:37.980
Otherwise, we'll have a nice morning.

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.780
So, for the moment, we're going to go to where all the campuses are.

01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:42.980
Because the only campuses are different places.

01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:44.980
The public schools are all different places.

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:47.480
And we're going to have to have a word-to-word conference.

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.480
I hope it's as good as it's going to be.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:49.980
So, yeah.

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.480
See you on Thursday.

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:51.980
Thank you, John.

01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:53.980
We're going to have to have another conference.

01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.980
Well, we have a conference that we're going to do in a minute.

01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.020
No, I don't think so.

01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:59.380
I'm just saying that we're going to stop here.

01:29:59.380 --> 01:29:59.880
So.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.380
All right.

01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.120
We're going to end.

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.700
And we have a little more than a thing.

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.380
We're going to stop here.

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:05.200
Oops.

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:05.820
We're going to end.

01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:06.320
All right.

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:06.820
Thanks.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:07.320
Thanks.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:07.820
Thanks.

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:08.960
Thank you.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.820
Now, I'll tell you a couple of things

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:12.480
that I didn't really try to answer.

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.380
Questions.

01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:15.340
We haven't had any questions.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:18.940
Can you tell us how you can potentially

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:20.540
increase your insurance costs?

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.040
Yeah.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.340
First of all, there are kind.

01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:39.340
So in the second column we were talking about the rights and he said, kind of thinking that the transportation needs to be a different kind of service.

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:48.340
So what we have now is a professional study here where they basically want people to look at how those requirements are to do it.

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:56.580
But unfortunately, I think we're still in the middle of a big fight at the game

01:30:56.580 --> 01:31:02.420
of whether they'll have to control whether they'll be allowed to put up anahmen.

01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:07.180
And we have this sort of a narrow line, and we're not going to smile.

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:09.100
We're going to put them in the middle.

01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:11.060
That's what we're going to do.

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:15.020
To start a movement, who do you think is going to be in the middle of a fight?

01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:17.180
Because that's not the real issue at this stage.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:26.360
But we haven't done any attention retention in 2020, especially coming into 2018

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.080
Where did you harsh things?

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:39.940
As I mentioned, we've done 10, 16, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 years
