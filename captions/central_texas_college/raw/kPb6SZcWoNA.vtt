00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
I'm going to take a question for Jocelyn, on how long,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.000
how many questions, how many days,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.940
it takes to get to the main point of the conversation,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.900
because I think that part of the question is that you

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.640
need to get to the point of the question,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.960
if you're going to take a question and ask a specialist

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.540
that has been on your discussion for many years,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.400
how are you going to go about doing that.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.020
Thank you.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.360
I'm going to take a question that I don't know,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.180
but I want to be sure that you're

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.020
going to get it right, right now.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.020
I'm sorry to show you that the last year's meeting was a little bit different.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.020
I was very, very excited about it.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020
I think it was a little bit more of a challenge than I had imagined, but I think it was a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.020
good thing.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.020
I'm very happy about it.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.020
The public comment was very good.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.020
I was very excited about it.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020
I think it was a good thing.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.020
I think that's what I wanted to do.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.020
I think that's what I wanted to do.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.340
Well, I don't know who the people are.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.000
It doesn't make much sense.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.860
I'm sure there are people who do get it.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.740
But I'm just guessing.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.000
It's just too good to know.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.580
It's the same.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.280
So please join me in giving us a few steps.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.000
I know you do some having fun, but I

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.220
want to take a moment to ask you that question.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.460
What advice would you give to people

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.280
who are very traditionalists, and who

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.340
haven't been around for a long time,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.920
who are very concerned that we're not

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.000
really doing the same things?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.440
are you going to build these stones in your home?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.940
OK.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.640
And we're going to give these all to Nick.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.160
How many of you are going to give these to Nick?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.240
Nick and I are going to give these to Nick.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.120
And Joe, you're going to give these to Nick, too?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.920
Yes.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.820
And this is for you.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.920
This is for Joe, too.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.780
And this is for you, too.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.460
And this is for me.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.160
So, we're going to put these all for Nick.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.060
Hi from the time when I was on the training,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.860
think there's not going to be any problem if I don't show up.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.000
So, we have been so happy to have brought it to you at this point.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.960
And I look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.960
Yes, please.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.720
Yes, we will be back soon.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.360
Thank you very much, Patrick.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.120
Thank you for your time, everyone.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.500
We are going to do a little bit of time travel,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.660
but I think you will already know that we have been

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.860
at the top of the test run,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.580
which is an example of how the biopsies will be developed,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.180
As we are in the midst of a new economic crisis, the crisis of the environment is one of the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.180
big ones.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.220
And I can say that we have an opportunity to invest in the climate to invest in the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.220
environment, and to invest in the environment is a great opportunity that we are in.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.060
And I'm sure that we will be able to do that, and I believe that we have a great opportunity

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.060
to invest in the environment.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.140
And I also look forward to the future of the climate and the future of the planet.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.460
And I think that we are in the middle of a fight with climate change.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:55.460
And then the next thing is the physical contribution of the professional development

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.460
and understanding of what sort of steps were shown and how they were performed in the past.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.460
And this is kind of a kind of a quick notice of sort of the work that we're doing in the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.460
next phase.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.460
And then the next thing is the work that we're doing in the next phase.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.960
I think that's what I'm going to do for the next couple of years,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.460
and I haven't actually done anything in the past year in a way that involves

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.460
going into the next decade and being like,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.460
oh, I have two lives now with someone,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.460
and I think that's going to be a big factor in my future.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.460
And I'm really excited about that,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.460
and I think I'll be back for a long time,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.460
and I'm looking forward to really trying to get through the next year,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.460
and I'm going to be very successful.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.520
Hi, I'm

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.820
I'm a professor at the University of California,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.860
and I'm a professor at the University of California,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.300
and I have a really good memory of the early days

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.900
of the University of California,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.880
and I think that's probably the biggest

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.780
of my first two years there.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.520
And my first time was actually

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.320
at the University of California,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.240
and I was just a little bit older

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.920
and I came to know this program

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.720
and I was really excited to learn about it.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.920
And I remember that I got a feeling

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:37.900
Thank you.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.920
So, if you're going to do a direct injection, you're going to have to do it four times before you're going to do a full shot.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.920
And that's just something that's going to be very careful.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.920
And if that doesn't work, then you're going to have to do it again.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.920
And then, after you're done, you're going to have to do it again.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.920
And then, we're going to have to find a treatment for it, and we're going to have to do it again.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.920
And that's how those masks are going to work.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.920
And this is just a quick example of how you can do it with a full shot.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920
Yes, please.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.920
So, I'm not going to look up the names, but I'm going to look at the number of people

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.920
that have been treated in the area of the case, more meaning more.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.920
I'm going to look at the two-part formula, whether it's the one that's in the way,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.920
whether it's the one that's in the way, because it's a couple of papers.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.920
And the six-part formula, of course, is more than five, even more than one.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.920
We don't have a whole set of other rules.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.920
So, we're going to look at the number of people who have been treated in the care practice.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920
Thank you.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.920
Thank you.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.920
I can't quite look at our communities and some of the other associations.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.920
This I think is getting at what I think is the most important process for protecting

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.920
the intelligence of 15 to 20 people at once, if not a little bit more.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.920
So, we really have to go back to the short-term expectations that we had before.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.920
Thank you.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920
Thank you.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920
I think we have to end the session.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920
I think we have to end the session.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.920
I think we have to end the session.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920
I think we have to end the session.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.920
I've got a couple of comments here.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.920
The first one is, you know, I'm a big fan of the old-school

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.920
and I love the way that I got paid in the physics community

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920
and I think that's really nice.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.920
I think it's really helpful.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.920
And I think that's very, very helpful for people to do this work.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.920
So, you know, we've got a six-month, I think,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.920
and a ten-month, and a ten-month,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.920
and a seven-month, and a nine-to-eight-four,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.920
and I think it's very successful.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.920
that's the next area of the definition, this is the last one of the definition.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.920
So, for example, the total numbers, which is the total number of the principles,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.920
numbers and the value of the numbers.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.920
So, the fifth is for privacy to children.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.920
If the privacy to children is not at all protected,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.000
So the conditions for that is going to be a mess.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So I'm not saying we don't have a solution,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.300
but I'm saying that we do.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.600
I'm telling you, we need a solution.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.360
Do you want to comment on this?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.160
Yes, and one more side of course,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.100
to get it to the center.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.500
We have no way to tell it to get it to the center.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.100
That's the thing.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.200
The center is the one that's the best.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.680
And sometimes we just don't want to leave those areas

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.680
So, to me, it's very, very useful.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.680
And before we get to that, I want to say that the main reason

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.680
for the difference in the way you use the term,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.680
I don't take it that way.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.680
If you have a lot of thought behind it,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.680
that is the only way you can actually change it.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.680
So, I think that's quite a few of the questions

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.680
that we will be answering.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.680
We will be asking those questions.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.680
So, I'd like you to focus on that in terms of policies.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.220
I'm a student from the student to the government students,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.220
but there is a lot of pressure to do this in every way.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.100
And I can't do this in a way that I'm not.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.260
It makes it difficult for students

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.380
to go to those new social events.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.640
So for instance, if you only have

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:03.020
$25,000 or $26,000, that's $56,000.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.800
And then if you have $1,200, that's

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.380
$1,000, and you know that the focus on the most of this

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.820
So, basically, we're going to have to go with that.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:21.140
So, this new administration is going to have to go through a whole bunch of new possible

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.480
things to start doing this month, and it's a tough decision.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:31.720
So, I would like to mention for that, I'm going to make, of course, a decrease in the

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.720
I think we're back to the, the terms go back to the, the last year, the new year,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.720
but it's still the case that we're not going to be watching this,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.720
because it's a good news, we're being known for the good news.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.720
Okay.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.720
So, on the second, the second, that I was relating to,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.720
I was saying this is probably the two most highly reputable,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.720
for the new year, challenges, but I want to,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.720
So I just want to say thank you to all the staff that participated this afternoon.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.720
I'm so excited to be here today.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.720
I'm going to go ahead and introduce you to the next speaker.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.720
I'm going to start with Mary.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.720
Mary, I'm going to start with you, Mary.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.720
I'm going to start with you, Mary.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.720
Thank you.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.720
Thank you.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.720
I'm going to start with you, Mary.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.720
Thank you.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.720
Thank you.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.720
Thank you.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.720
Thank you.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.900
with the international industry, what that is.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.720
But that obviously, in the district,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.060
seems to be exactly the same.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.060
One of the things that we would emphasize

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.180
is that services or consumers can

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.940
have a serious impact on the district.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.600
So you have to get into the district.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.560
And we'll talk about this in the workshop.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.960
And we'll make a second channel in the future

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.960
and then we'll do some more analysis.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.960
So, actually, I think that this is a really good example of how we can use the

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.960
application to do some more analysis.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.960
And then we'll go over to the next slide, okay?

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.960
And then we'll go over to our next slide, please.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.960
And then we'll go on, now to the next slide, we'll go over to the next slide,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.160
is the first one we will do.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.680
Then we have to tell you a little bit about the next step.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.520
That is to get the project to the next stage.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.520
And then we have to determine if we want to change the rules

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.320
and then we can do the same thing over and over again.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.400
The next step is to have a separate channel.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.480
So that students will follow through the next steps.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.920
And then we have to set up the video to go to the next step.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.760
And then we have to follow the process

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.560
to start the presentation.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.960
I think the question is very important.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960
Thank you.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you a question.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.960
I was going to give you the next question.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.960
This is the question.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.960
When you first go around to the city,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.960
are there any things that you know that you can do

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.960
that are more than just closing the door

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.960
to the library system?

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.960
We have received feedback from some of our students

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.960
and there was a continuing coalition work with the United States.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.960
That included the insurance and the documentation

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.960
from the United Nations Health Service,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.960
the National Health Service Group,

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.960
the Department of Health Services,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.960
the United States Health Service People,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.960
and the United Nations National Health Service.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.960
And that was done through a joint effort.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.960
So it was a joint effort to expand the program

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.960
and the communication.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.200
and then it's major change. And two of the first ones we've done is we have a school

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.560
management project. And that takes the right all the team members from the university of

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:57.000
St. Louis to the space plant and the public community to the school plant. And then our

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.320
faculty and the students go to the sub-camp. And the next one is the state community

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.200
project and it's also important. So I'm going to be representing the other medical

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:12.200
$200,000, and then find out which purchase dates were your first purchase date.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.200
And then I want to bring it to the page of the purchase workforce, and that will be the

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.200
case for the first three months, the first three months, the first three months, and

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.200
then the next three months.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.200
So that way, you can make sure that you get the price, and you can make sure that you

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.200
can get the price, so you can share it with others.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.200
And actually, this is a really different situation than that.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.800
and that's going to be really interesting when the world is going to be able to see it that way.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.100
So now let's break the record this way.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.900
That is total, our limitations are now,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.200
going 740,000,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.900
right, 431,000.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.200
So the mission was basically to,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.700
um, get a series of standards to be able to understand how to use them,

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.200
um, and also, um,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.200
and then we can put our images in a little more simpler way.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.200
So I'm currently working on the F1.3-shaped project, and it works.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.200
And I already have it in the first link, which I'm going to show you in just a moment.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.200
Right-click. And then we have...

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:30.200
I'm going to show you a group of people that are part of the project.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.200
They are part of the team of our Trans-Industrial Development.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.200
That is for a group of people who are working with the project.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:45.200
This group is a group of 316 people, which is the number of people who are participating in this.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.200
This will be a lot of provider support services, and we support all of these services.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.200
So, thank you for the information. We are looking forward to seeing you in the future.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200
Thank you.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200
So, thank you.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200
Thank you.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.200
Thank you.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.200
And here's a quick follow-up question. I'm sure you've heard this before from the

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.200
commissioners. They have explained that we wish to meet you soon.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.200
And we are looking forward to it.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.200
And it's our health that we need to continue to bring to the program.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:23.200
Now if I have $39,188, this means that I can purchase in private, to manage and move over in the end, or to take care of that.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:30.200
And the last one is, to take care of the purchase commission, there are some pictures on the board.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.200
That one is for the age of 16, 2-year-old and 9-year-old.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.000
So we are going to use our first step, and we'll start from the second step, and we'll start with the first step.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.240
So we're going to start with the first step, we're going to look at the first step and then the second step.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.720
So the next step that we're going to do is we need to increase our skill-adjust skill and skills education rate.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.820
So the net rate is going to be around 270,000, and so you're going to take the two dollars.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.060
That means that if you want to have a few of these, you don't have to purchase them.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:12.060
You can have a few of these and you can have a few of these and you can have a few of these.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.900
Then there's the informal payment agent or NGO.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.300
It's $2.1 million.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:24.100
The people who have the right to request you, they want to have a free point of entry.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.340
And then there's the employer.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:38.340
In the current career of TPP, we are the only asset. We are the asset foundation for our

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:45.340
100,000 workforce at work. We are the only person in charge of the logistics books for

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.340
our website. Now we work for the characters of the 12-4 commission, and the construction

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:55.340
the search for the phrase. And our teacher, Devin, took out 20 different

00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:00.340
search words out of it. And this one here is what Christmas means

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.340
as a way to make your work easier and better as a way for you to help your

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.340
workers. And what Christmas means to you is not only to help your workers, but also

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.340
to give them the opportunity to learn English and engage with their communications.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.140
The next column is called Platform

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.140
The next column is called Platform

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.140
Texas Tech will connect you with it.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.140
Texas Tech will connect you with it.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.140
There was first leisure and vulnerability,

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.140
now you're in the center of the system.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.140
Now you're in the center of the system.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.140
And so as you gain real-life commitment

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.140
And so as you gain real-life commitment

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.140
your physical skillset can be

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.140
your physical skillset can be

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.140
proficient in social industry.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.140
This can be seen in the

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.140
this can be seen in the

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.400
the basic decision-making certification.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.840
Now this is a little bit.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.820
Okay.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.220
There we go.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.460
That's four of it.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.180
And it's $1,500 per month.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.020
$7,200 a month, at $116.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:12.260
So the actual time is 8.9 minutes in the book, and it's always been on the way.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.619
I think I've seen the ones that come back.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.700
We work with that one similar development group.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.819
We do work with them on the bullet points resources.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:27.220
We actually work with our advisory board, and then we also work with our multi-party

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.740
statistics resources.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.900
And that's the end of the presentation.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.500
I hope that answers your questions.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.720
So, that's what I'm trying to, that's, that's what I'm trying to do with that as well.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:46.580
But, you know, we're in a, in a situation where community is so much, you know,

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.100
not only for communities but for all of us.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.260
So, you know, you can talk about the, you know,

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.600
you know, the summer, the summer in the United States,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:04.440
how the airport is a, is a, is a, is a, is a, is a,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.440
who are you going to be the one evaluating those students?

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:14.440
Well, to talk about PEPFAR, when we are talking about PEPFAR, we have a different approach.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.440
We're going to stay on the same level as what we want the students to go through.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.440
And that's going to be part of our research.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:28.440
And after we've done the research, we cover the steps until we have what we're doing,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.440
which is actually two different things.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.880
and it's extremely fascinating.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.980
And we want to explore, especially

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.080
when we take the exact type of experiments

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.040
that we do in the field, we want to explore

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.840
the different kinds of phenomena that happen in the atmosphere.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.760
We want to be able to get a closer

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.040
to the actual piece of the earth world

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.500
than we would be able to do in the real world.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.640
We also want to understand the approaches

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.080
that we allow the media to interpret.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.580
Thank you.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.080
Thank you.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.580
Thank you.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.080
Thank you.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.580
Thank you.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.080
Thank you.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.580
Thank you.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.080
Thank you.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.580
Thank you.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.080
Thank you.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.580
Thank you.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.080
Thank you.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.280
You already know this, right?

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.760
There are lots of different types of animals.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.220
This is a sort of animal that I don't know.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.060
But I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say who it is.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.520
It's one of the popular children.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.360
I'm not going to say anything about animals.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.240
I'm just going to say that I've been reading

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.080
the article that we had written about this.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.420
And I'm trying to get a little bit of my own idea

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.960
of what it's going to be like.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.400
And then, we're doing a test communication with our bank, and we're going to stop the

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.840
business for a couple of years.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:42.720
And we need to state, we have a rate, we've got a term, and then we need to get distributed.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720
So, we're going to do that.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.720
And then, we're going to have to do it first.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.640
So, we're going to have to do it by the time, I just wanted to mention that we have a commercial

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.400
and I'm in response to that in a pretty exclusive way.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.920
So, again, I'm not going to make a decision to preserve this

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.400
through a contract union, through a great board.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.640
But I also want to say that we have two days left

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.640
that we've actually had to clear the program

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.640
and that's the first that we did clear.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.760
So, we are now at a correction about the grant transition

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.600
and in supporting that program for our students more importantly.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:27.360
I think the way that we're doing this for COVID is that we're not just going to be

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.360
really self-reliant on this.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.480
We're going to look at, for me specifically, what we do and what we want to know from this

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.600
and what we want.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.600
And COVID is a little dialect.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.600
We're going to take this word of mouth, we're going to have a conversation, we're going

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.600
to have a trade, a conversation, and say, I need this for my program, I need this for

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.600
my program, I need this for this program.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.920
by the medicine. And the whole thing is a protein division and that makes money for

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.960
the database and the department, that's the benefit. And to really have the ability to

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.640
work with the evidence from data science and our expertise, getting that looked at, using

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.720
the core tools, the things in the core tools and how it was developed, that helps. And

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:15.840
then also the core data, our core programs are completely on our pre-schedulation data

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.200
as far as how we should respond after they complete our programs.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.400
Also, we have a very comprehensive program called H-E,

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.400
which is a education equipment.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.400
I want to know what was it about,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.200
and how did you get to this one?

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.200
What did you do before?

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.200
And how does this make you feel about programming?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.200
What is your best and second best?

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.200
I don't know.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.200
Thank you.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.200
Thank you.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.200
So, we have to do a great job

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.640
I'd like to make a note also to the faculty and all the individuals,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.860
I just want to remind everybody that this is at the start,

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.200
we can't be doing it without this one for you.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.860
And I appreciate your understanding of the learnings that exist in class.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.460
We're looking forward to the presentation.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.160
I can say we're going to continue this study

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.080
and it's going to be a long, continuing conversation with you all.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.940
So bear with us until we finish and then we'll jump on stage.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:14.940
But it was a friend of mine who went through the preparation process and gave me the entire

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.940
permission to do it.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.940
And what they did in fact is a really different way to do it.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.940
And I was very engaged in this environment where the structure of the financial process

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.940
was very, very complex for me.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.940
Not because of the money or anything, but because there are some changes to the plans

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.940
in terms of where the support is going to go.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:43.940
It means that we will not be able to do social services, social care services, absolutely not.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:51.940
It just means that this website will have to be opened on the right, which I don't think we have to do.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:23:01.940
So we want to continue to accept this opportunity and show you that there is opportunity to increase your educational status,

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.940
with the military and then as we're on the way in with the troops.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:12.940
So, and so, as we stand back here right now, there's a perfect opportunity to do something

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.940
that way.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.940
Right.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.940
And then if we have a round of support, I just want to take a minute to ask you a question.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.940
A question for the police.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.940
What would you say?

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.940
I don't really have any questions.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.940
I mean, we're going to get through this in a little bit.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.940
So, that was the next example.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.440
It is, it depends. So, again, we've got a lot of questions,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.940
we have a lot of questions that are in here for the purpose of understanding that.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.940
And we will, we do have to determine what, what, what,

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.940
and from there, that's a completely new idea.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.940
We have a new question on campus for each side.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:52.940
And we'll determine which team are we going to bring back for this project, our program.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:24:01.940
So, we can see that by looking at what you're looking at, there's no cost of that, so, we're sure.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:08.940
So, what do you mean by the concerns that we have with the climate change?

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:15.940
Well, as well, if you're writing a book, it's decided that the position of the rest of the climate is not truly fair.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.940
I thought you were going to say the same thing.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.940
Yeah, I think it's a better way to make it.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.940
Yes.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.940
So, what we're going to do is we're going to do a factor and then we're going to do two add-ons.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:34.940
And for the box we have a factor vector and the solution is going to be any sequence of factors.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:40.940
So, she's a comma and we're going to put a part-time stamp in straights and a times.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.940
Okay.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.940
Okay.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.940
Okay.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.940
Yes.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.940
If you're in the way of this, you're going to have to go out and help.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.940
I hope you see my stamp right. I'm sure it's written right there.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.940
Thank you.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.940
So, I'm going to ask you to look at the other two, so I'll give you the opportunity to...

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.940
The person I'm going to look at is one of these men, I think, who's going to put them at the...

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.940
I think it's the other guy.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:13.940
I would like to request that the dispensers have a badge and just like a tag in their mind,

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:19.940
I would like to remind the existing users that they will not purchase wildflowers

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.940
from our toxicity works.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.940
Fourthly, I would like to designate any deals reporting equipment from the program

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.940
or from the other examples.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:36.940
So I'm requesting this to all staff, safety, and I would like to inform you that I have

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.940
I think that's a really good question.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.940
Thank you.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.940
I have a question.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.940
Just a little further, you were talking about the

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.940
character-calling message.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.940
Is that part of the requirement for the

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.940
general public?

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.940
Is it a best practice?

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.940
And if you ask me, do you know what that

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.940
would be?

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.940
I do.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.940
I think it's not that important.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.940
I don't think it's important.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.940
I don't think it's important.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.940
I don't think it's important.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.940
I don't think it's important.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.200
If you're asking what they can do out there,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.500
they will tell you how to apply for the job.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.080
Thank you.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.580
All right.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.980
I'll take that back to you.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.480
Yeah.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.680
Thank you.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.760
Can I do the job?

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.260
You can.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.020
That's the guy.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.660
That's the guy.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.320
Oh, that's the guy.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.820
That's the guy.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.320
That's the guy.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.560
That's the guy.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:38.080
Since then, we've been making professional, face-to-face conversations for our department,

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:44.480
the company, and testing services, and doing all of the best we can to help people and

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.640
help our industry progress.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.440
We reached out, I don't know if you know the word, but sometimes I think it's called

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.440
I think that's what we're going to do.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:01.440
If we're going to have a company that's going to have a lot of revenue and balance in there,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.440
that's what we're going to do.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:09.440
And then we're going to think about timing out and then we'll go over some of the success

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.440
that we've had with the rate to the percentage of people.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.440
So we'll talk about the expenses that we're going to be getting out of it.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.480
over a year for years. So it's fantastic.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.920
I really appreciate this, it is tiny measure.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.180
But, I think it's really, it's a very important.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.840
Thank you very much, that's great, thank you for having me.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.160
Thank you for having me, I was just gonna say, you know, I got it.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.020
I'll do it have to go.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.020
Okay.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.360
Have a good day.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.140
Okay.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:38.960
Thank you.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:40.880
Thank you.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.380
Thank you for having me.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.140
Thank you for making my day today.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:42.720
Thank you for having me.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.220
Thank you for having me.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:43.720
Thank you, thank you.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.220
Thank you.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.720
Thank you.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.220
Thank you.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:45.940
Thank you for having me.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:50.940
The first one is a very simple and easy one.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.940
It's a simple type of English that we forget.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.940
It's actually a very simple language.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.940
It's just that it's a last line after we've been in it for a different period of time.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.940
We'll be doing that later as well.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.940
So, just to...

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.940
So, I'm not really going to give you a full script for this.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.940
I'm going to give you a little bit of a name for this.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.940
I think we're going to give you a little bit more information.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:14.940
But I'm going to take some words that are about to end up in the presentation.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:21.940
about the different kinds of alcohol. And I'm trying to be a little bit more of a

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:26.940
student, a student who knows the kitchen. And it was something that I was able to start

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.940
from that was like, these days, we don't have a lot of school, and we didn't have a

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.940
school, but we're going to have a school, and we're going to have a school.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:39.940
And then, we had a really good program, so we could teach students the problem of

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.940
for reducing social demographics,

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.940
and to change that with more conversations.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.940
And the second is,

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.940
no, I'm not going to do this.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.940
And,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.940
in fact, I still believe this is where

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.940
it's most important to have a good

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.940
communication with the parents

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.940
and the children and the parents

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.940
and the parents and the parents.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:28:59.940
And,

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.940
because we've seen it,

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.940
there are a lot of students who have asked

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.940
for a lot of questions,

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.940
and the students don't have

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.940
those kinds of questions.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.940
Those are actually,

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.940
I don't know,

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:07.940
you know,

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:08.940
students that come to my center

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.100
that's being expressed in some classic technical policy,

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.840
there's a lot of these conditions

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.500
that we're going to be looking at now.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.960
And that's just a little bit of a question for me.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.460
Thank you.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:18.960
Thank you.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.460
Thank you.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:19.960
Thank you.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.460
Thank you.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:20.960
Thank you.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.700
So one of the issues we're having

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.120
is the point of the word, which is

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.560
a traditional practice of writing.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.020
And if you want to use it as a form of language

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.660
or as a form of English, you can.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.900
You can use those terms as columns in the format.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.500
You're hearing your group's comments on the support for benefits.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.340
I don't know if that's something that's going on.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.940
You know, it's kind of a weird thought.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.620
I think that's something that's happening right now,

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.300
which is really unexpected, isn't it?

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.700
So, is that the answer?

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.100
No.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:53.500
Okay.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.700
I think, I think, you know, the European Union is changing,

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.300
and the European Union is changing,

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.820
and the Australian Union is changing.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.620
I think this is.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.180
This is.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.220
This is the question.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.900
Um, yeah.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.220
Um, I think that the European Union,

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:11.220
I think everyone at the press house doesn't know that we did because we didn't have an announcement today.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:17.220
But, uh, so I don't know the details, but it sounds like it's really important.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.220
I know, I know. I'm not a big fan of the news, but I think it's important.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.220
I think it's really important.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.220
I don't know what's wrong with the press.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:31.220
Yeah, I think they're going to be very important because they're somewhat non-political,

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.920
I think, I think that's it.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.920
Are there any last-minute questions?

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.920
No, I don't think so.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:46.920
So, I just wanted to ask, is there any other questions you have, or do you have anything?

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.920
No, I don't think there is anything.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.920
Do you have any other questions?

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.920
Well, I don't know if they are in the chat.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.920
So I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.920
So I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.920
I mean, I don't consider it an activity as a national training program.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.920
I think it's just going to be a very important part of security management.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.920
And so basic science security is awareness.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.920
We use that in the United States of Texas.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.920
And we try to come up with devices.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.920
We have a particular person in this particular case,

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.920
about the data performance.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.920
And we're going to have a number of questions for you.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.920
So, we're going to have a question for you.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.920
So, we're going to have a question for you.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.920
So, we're going to have a question for you.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.920
Do you want to respond to the key effects of

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.920
QGC confidential data and information research

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.920
and the approach of statistical learning together?

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.920
And what are the key security goals for strategies?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:54.920
We do know that Ontario has a period of policy and state control that's not subject to court.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.920
And so if you think that you can look at that, that would be a very useful thing.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.920
And we're trying to do those things, and so that's the reason.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.920
So what is the most important information?

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.920
Well, it's information that must be protected.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.920
So it's an important right, it's a great job.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:23.920
The public access based on state or federal law is also required with this and that is going to be taken into account for the general public.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:33.920
The law protection and the ILO has been able to offer formally identifiable information.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:42.640
Both feeds can include a name, a special security number, the number of start, number of addition, identification,

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:49.680
whether it's made in the United States, the permissions, the fingerprint,

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:59.680
line codes, so in the end you should access the devices and this is where you can use the project for

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.000
um, get the code and the credit card in this process. You see it's not good right now.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.920
Yeah, we also need to protect our security of information. We have a bad image of permissions

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:20.400
in each of each of the data systems. Um, we're, um, protecting from controls here at CTC.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:28.080
Um, that can include the original credentials, um, login information, um, data information

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:34.640
regarding the structure and the configuration of security for the controls that we have here at CTC.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.800
We have policies and procedures needed to gain access to the resources.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.400
It's top information, both personal and community secrets.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.360
Interaction policy and certain types of research data.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:57.600
Any other information left, CTC would like to take place to develop information.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.600
Okay, we have a question.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.640
Thanks, Noah.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.840
We have a question.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.360
Can the Internet of International Resources be done on the law?

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.159
And what are the ways for that to ensure compliance with the protocol

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.000
that the people state need?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.480
What regulations and mandates are going on in the Internet of International Resources?

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.040
How can I place funding in acceptable practices

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.760
regarding the use of those resources

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:31.159
and to indicate to the nature of the next one to do with or cybersecurity to be able to do that

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:35.960
on the front of the fence in fact which is directly disturbing the idea of the project.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.520
So understand the economic price and declaration security risk.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:52.040
Risk in this dashboard is called price and it's dealing with information risk research.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:58.040
Some of those are just kind of things that are actually contained in the page.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:05.040
And that's actually kind of all the information that we can actually put into actual description.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.040
Because this has to be intentional.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.040
And that's what it's asking.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.040
And it's also an intellectual property of that.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.040
And other organizations are like ATS.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:28.040
That was the main thing that I wanted to add, so some of the potential damage,

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:34.040
the mental loss, and then intervention in clinical services,

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:43.040
and then alcohol experience, and other restrictions that are regulatory for agencies.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:50.040
I think some of you were here, and we were in New York, and you had reached a couple of years ago.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:57.040
I know a lot of people were holiday-pranked, and you had to carry your life.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:05.040
You didn't have to impact them, you were set up to tackle them, to have fun, it wasn't a big thing,

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.040
and it didn't happen, but to be thrown a little bit in the right place,

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:16.040
do not survive in a traditional system. And that's where we are looking at how to

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:22.040
develop any confidential information that we can use in our control. That's the key thing.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:29.040
So, as a last thought, we are in the initial phase of the analysis, but it looks like I

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:35.040
can teach you a little bit more of the ICS, the mobile device settings, what are the new

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:45.920
desktop devices, laptops and that the software must be acceptable in many industrial communities.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:58.560
So we will have the free trial type of software that you can see out there. We've asked the

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.320
the two buttons on your devices.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.920
For instance, we have changes to our other device,

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.920
but we have two options.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.960
And also, we're doing that already for

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.400
all computer-based systems and business systems.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.200
And if you are asking about something from your IT,

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.800
you can tell us the code,

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.320
and we will be able to guide you on the right direction.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:37.260
So we're listening to conditions that are related to contract documents or payment

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.560
contracts as far as we can. There's in some cases things that have to do with the license

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:50.160
that we can call it. So that would be a selection of system such as a list view. So we're going

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:58.940
to be licensed by the New York City D.C. level such as Office 365, which is the first

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.860
really to do that, and that is D.C. licensed by each department.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.620
What is the PACE software?

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.940
It is an intensive stack of tools.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:20.940
As for these numbers, software that focuses on recording the learning experience, recording from the text search,

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:28.940
recording the access to the computer, tools and tools and instructions available for the user to participate in,

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:35.940
to be able to read. And what we have in the session today are two software engineers,

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.440
and how often this may be put yourself in trouble.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.940
Even getting a private community actually requires a really good education.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:53.440
So we have some of the contacts that we use for our self-employed access system

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.940
and when they do access the system they do ask these people to have a security training

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:04.940
and we have to have a maturity education or a business model to be able to assist them.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:09.940
that can be performed with suggestions about where you can always reach a decision,

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:15.940
with the suggestions you can always reach, and provide a reasonable decision algorithm for your support.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:20.940
And then finally, each of those lists just the data that you would like to see.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:32.940
So what are some of the best suggestions and information resources that can include

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.940
We have two students, two students.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.940
I like his name.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.940
Christine.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.940
Christine.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.940
And, uh,

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.940
so, of course, we have our

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.940
Christine. Um, first,

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.940
I would like to begin by just

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.940
to let you know that

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.940
you should come to the end of

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.940
the webinar. Um, they are going to

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.940
um, take you into the

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.940
discovery of propositional information.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.940
Um, so if you need

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:10.700
um, um, the nursing public staff or, uh, the civil rights and IT or, um, um, work vendors,

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:15.180
people that make a good use of the internet, specific kinds of directions or other computer

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:22.460
devices or, you know, we, I think that, um, some people, people together, they give us

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.780
their information so that we can go out there and fix it, you know, and I know that's one

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.780
your passport to anyone, if you do have any issues like that.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:33.780
So, if you do have an accident or something like that, you can contact us.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.780
So, if you have an accident, you can contact us.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.780
We'll be able to respond to that and we'll be able to assess whether you have a passport.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.780
And we'll be asked what is your passport.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:47.780
So, if you have a passport, get help to get it on your device.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:53.780
And, if you have a responding, serial media page,

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:59.780
things. Things like the idea of just not running late so that we could go out and take back

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:04.780
some time before we get this correct again. So if you can get rid of these emails or if

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.780
you're going to delete some of them like that, then just go play along with it because it's

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.780
very much easier.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:18.780
Spare systems. One of the big areas that I think is important is that we have to have

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.780
the problem which we've been talking about is that we do research going to the internet

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.780
specifically in the digital world for the AI tool program. So, we think that what we've

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.780
done is successful with the research that we've done.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.780
And I'm just going to compare this with the device we were told we'd have here.

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.780
I think this is the device.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.780
I think this is the device.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.780
This is the device.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.780
And this is the device.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:50.780
So for a real life service agent to work, there's a basic email.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:59.480
So do you want to make sure that if they're in the week, the email is not provided, the list is expected,

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.580
that you will, if you don't like it, mention that you will.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.580
The third one is to just delete that order.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:11.280
Again, constantly, I do not say it's just to, it's a different, it's a much more difficult way.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.280
before you do that, you should have the following links.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:26.280
Because they could lead you to a website or an internet web or a virus or lead to other activities

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.280
to actually do and save time and space for you.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.280
Okay, thank you.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:38.280
So, we are also looking for any updates or, I would use our, the internet for research

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:44.600
search to web updates or your web extension level of data, they also can search to web links

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.040
of your iOS or your physical location levels.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.120
So the other one to add in to now is the web feature.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:02.120
And this is going to be a user's own, so for example, an Android, you can probably take

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:07.800
any personal information or just a sheet with slides, PDFs, and documents that you've taken

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.800
to the services. And of course I think the big one is the

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.800
the, there's a conversation probably bigger form

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.800
looks like a better form, but it's been

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.800
closer to actually not actually

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.800
a clear, more specific way of doing anything at all

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.800
is doing everything on its own to grow the consultation

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.800
concept. So, I'm really excited about that. I hope that's

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:40.300
So, I'm going to go ahead and I'm just going to show you what we're going to talk about

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.800
this week is the Lucas and Tactics to answer your questions about what this is.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:50.800
So, this is the Lucas and the Lucas and Tactics and the Lucas and Tactics and the Lucas and

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:55.800
Tactics and again it's easy to go into the room, what I do is run around the room and

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.800
I just go ahead and do it.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.800
Okay.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.800
And for me, this is without actually any red lights, you know, we were just starting to

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.800
So when you're collecting the documentation you need to check the website,

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.800
what website is that, and you can decide sometimes in the case of a copyrighted document.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.800
And this is an example here.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:24.800
What this means is that you're filling out the individual documents you're accessing,

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.800
you're checking the data you've searched, but the different websites are the same.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.800
And then also part of the bonus is that you have the right data to see it.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:42.560
So, I think, if you're sure that you're going to be able to do it, with 71, if you're at

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.520
this particular point in your search, I think you're sure that you're able to go out there

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.400
and just, you know, just reschedule that list for research.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.720
And if you're going to have time to do one of the three things on this list, make sure

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.320
that you're thinking about the top of the list, the bottom of the list, try to make

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:04.320
so that we can ensure that we are doing what we are doing and we are doing what we are doing.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.320
Thank you.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.320
I just want to mention that we have some sort of technical skills.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:23.320
We have found that activists, founders, and all groups in some states,

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.320
So these are some of the ones that we have some of our trust controls.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.320
And we're going to have two tools, which is the weather protection.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.320
It could be a retainer. It could be a transport carrier.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.320
Special police have to use a lot of their safety equipment.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.320
It could be a hate. It could be a national security.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:46:00.320
I'll just go for it. There are a lot of times people that go out there and they do this because they think they can do that.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.320
And if you can catch this, this is what we're trying to do.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:09.320
So one single product that we don't need, we're willing to make a little investment in.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.320
So we can't just try to stay a bit too long or too long.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:21.320
So we can see how many units are in different places, how many units, how many products from different areas,

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:30.320
how much is the mass, how many units are in the batches, and actually on the interventional desk,

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:35.320
we can see where the number of participants was and how many of them were in the laboratory.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:42.120
I think you will also be able to connect with the law here and I'm willing to follow your

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.320
discussions that we've been taking and we've picked on these links.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:53.320
I'm going to have to check for a lot of things and I'm afraid to leave this message

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.320
to the people that you know yet.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:03.320
And so I'm going to want to invite you to have a conversation with us as to what is

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.960
and the email address of the particular email has come through.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.760
And we will issue that to all the users on the site.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.120
There is a particular email that's circulating in Facebook

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.720
that has been linked to the internet in the past.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.560
And this is your internet traffic policy.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:31.320
So what is your network state?

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:37.320
to incorporate a local newspaper, sometimes a newspaper that is appropriate,

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:44.320
and all of the data that was used for the introduction of data tracking practices

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:51.320
to websites and applications was compiled to the distribution of this policy.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:57.320
The ability for activity or learning functions to be able to use this website

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.320
is okay too, or you like the name of the company.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:09.320
And make sure that you also keep the services access data in the app,

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.320
or place it on a computer or a software cloud,

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.320
like the Google Chrome file or something,

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.320
so the computer has a lot of storage space for the same data.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.320
I'm going to go back to the back.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.320
I'm going to go back to the back.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.320
I'm going to go back to the back.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.320
Make sure that you know the words and that they're sufficient

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:35.320
for the information to engage our, our representative.

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.320
Make sure that your combinations are smooth,

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.320
that they're fully translated and that our

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.320
field score and our work isn't too difficult.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.300
And I like to want to find a place where people can look this door and

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.320
the importance of state of representation changes.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.320
And it's a very nice big thing to ask that was more to do with the report.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:05.320
Because we can see a lot of the stories that were written so we can see them in the report.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.320
And it's a very nice thing to do.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.320
And I want to thank you for that.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:17.320
So basically, the rules of the report, and it's great for the report.

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:32.320
And technically when you do IT you want to treat it as a digital license and you want to be sure to enable a digital change for first time.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:41.320
So if you're going to do a business, if you're going to do a business tool with a first time and you're not working for it, do you change that?

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:48.320
So you want to do that. If you want to do track data, you can do that in a little bit after this.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.320
So that way you can, if you're able to put it on someone else's properties,

00:49:54.320 --> 00:50:01.320
you can take what you need software to deal with your ads, to your postal, or your transfer data,

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:06.320
or follow through on your system, your online system, to get you to a good, more decent amount.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:12.320
I want to say what my features are that I'm using, which are a couple of other things.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.320
These are infrared and they're very, very light in size.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.320
And they're very, very light in size.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.320
So, um, and one thing that I'm trying to do is,

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.320
I'm trying to figure out what kind of the kind of, um,

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.320
the kind of information that we've got available,

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.320
um, so it's as simple as, you know,

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:39.760
specific responses, we have to watch, um, I don't know, but, you know, um, people that

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:45.600
have apps that are able to access your device through the Wi-Fi, and so, you know, if you're

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:51.200
in a public space, um, you might want to, you know, close the doors, so you know, you can

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:57.120
leave them without watching this game at, um, one time, so that you don't, you know,

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:03.120
I think that is a negative path, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it in my full life.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:07.120
I don't think I'm doing it in my full life. I'm going to go with what the values are.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:11.120
I'm going to go with what the values are. I'm going to go with what the values are.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:17.120
And so I'm trying to think of how to exceed the standard level of solid, solid like this,

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:20.120
with some trapping and things like that.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:26.120
You can view the voice from the other side of the device.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:33.120
And you can also access the audio from the other side.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:39.120
And the way that it's all information is through all of the wires, through the two

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.120
different heads.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:46.120
Now the easiest way to do that is that, you know, if you're not looking from that device

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:51.120
anymore and you actually go out to review a new shot which writes all the information

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:58.120
off of something like this. And that way you can go out and just do anything you want.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:09.120
So the protection, now we're going to do a spray. We can do a spray here on this project

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:15.120
and we can also watch that you're out there and what we've made in the spray. So you

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.120
So you have computers.

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.120
The best way to do it is to actually download the work.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:25.120
You don't want to actually want to do the work in the section so it's probably a good idea to do it first.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.120
The second way to do it is to use the web generator.

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.120
So we have a little chat we did about the web generator.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.120
You can also actually actually close your files.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.120
So you can do that with a web generator.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.120
Of course, there is a simple access to the web.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:49.360
I'll just visit them through the night, go out to the mall, play around, and keep track of your textbooks,

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:55.600
as you have in the museum. And what they're doing is they're trying to execute the topic that I'm teaching.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.360
So, I'm going to show you some examples of the facts that I've seen so far.

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:06.720
And I'm basically used to generally reading in my own laptop, however,

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:11.720
So, go to a particular website, and then from there, turn to the cell list, and then call

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:15.720
the technical group at the school team, and then we'll do an email with you.

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.720
And, um, write somewhere.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:24.720
So, when it's periodical, computer, and you're a long time person, what does that mean?

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.720
When you're going to school, how many minutes, how much do you think they will expect?

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:32.720
So, I mean, I think a lot of times, they're trying to get to both peer mentors and the

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.720
and not professionally and not as a doctor.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.720
So, not just be a part of the agenda, but kind of focus a bit,

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.720
which is either on or on the internet.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:49.720
And this is how the learning style of solving would actually be effective.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.720
So, we'll just pull this.

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.720
And we'll send it here and start it.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.720
And you can find it on your toolbar.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:05.720
So, for example, computers, I mean, the SIP is for, um, um, I've got some sort of segment

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.720
that's for multi-flowers and aggregations.

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.720
And then, you have your action.

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:15.720
If you want to do your SIP, you want to do your action, you have to have action in your

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.720
code, and you have to have action in your dice, and you have to have action in your

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.720
And anybody with self-worth is able to go back to the workforce.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.720
In part, they can be linked to computers, smartphones.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:35.720
Another thing that my husband can do is, about indicators, especially when you look at your

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:41.720
first year of the training, is always indicate that you have a similar idea of how that's done.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.720
And that will generally be from a hypertension.

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:47.720
And you need to sometimes try to do that on your own.

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.720
No questions.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:53.720
Yes, one more.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.720
You talked about the white flag for a black flag.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.720
That's our main issue for now.

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.720
So do you find it easier if you do it directly

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.720
from the other side or do you do it manually?

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.720
Or just, you know, every school district

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.720
has their own way of using the same strategy?

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.720
If that was the one approach you would make,

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:21.160
from that time because I think these guys going on in the desert is probably too likely

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.080
you know that's the problem.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.160
Thank you.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:33.560
I want to tell you that during my time in the US, I was in the US for a long time.

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.820
and clean water in the middle.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.600
It's not the one that's in the water,

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.960
it's the one that's in the cage.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.240
And we've kind of worked on getting a few of those out,

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.700
and then we have the idea to start

00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:47.540
cutting them out, if you like.

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:48.380
It's nice to meet you.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.120
I'm sorry, do you have any other points?

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.640
I know we have a few questions.

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.540
I mean, I don't know.

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:54.220
Sorry, I'm sorry.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:54.720
I'm sorry.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.720
You've got a question?

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.220
I'm sorry.

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:56.720
I'm sorry.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.220
I'm sorry.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:57.720
I'm sorry.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.220
I'm sorry.

00:55:58.220 --> 00:55:59.520
So I'm just trying to help you out.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.660
I'm very grateful.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:05.660
I don't know if that's a good way to put it, but I know that there are a lot of companies

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.660
that are doing that sort of thing.

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.660
I know that there's a lot of companies out there that are doing that, but I know that

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.660
there's a lot of companies that are doing that.

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:19.660
So, you know, the question I want to ask is, how do we stop data from being a big thing,

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:27.660
which, I mean, data sources, you can kind of say the same thing, but consider this,

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:29.420
And to be honest, I'm not sure.

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.420
To be honest, I don't understand the two.

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:35.600
The other one is, you know, the thing that you said about

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.700
the context of the other two is sort of subtle.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.620
And that's why we can try to summarize it.

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.540
And one of the things that's really important is that if you

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.120
try to compare this to the ones that we'll consider,

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.060
that will not determine the information

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:51.480
that you're going to get this time.

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.460
So we're going to go there.

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:54.960
It's all wrong.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.020
You know what I mean?

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:57.820
It's not right.

00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:58.420
It's not right.

00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.220
No, it is.

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.620
No, it's not right.

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.760
Thank you, my friend.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.280
I'm sorry.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.060
I'm sorry.

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.820
Well, you did well on the report this morning.

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.900
I'm sorry.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:08.400
I'm sorry.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.040
Reflections?

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:09.540
I'm sorry.

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:10.180
I can tell you.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.080
We have reflections with the US.

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.160
We have a discussion.

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.420
The US is several key countries.

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:20.340
We have the US, Europe, the UK, the US.

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.180
So I don't know.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.780
So, these are the types of information that we're actually using for our work.

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.980
These are the direct reports that we would still take.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:33.420
So, we start with the current auditorium table, the council, the chief of committee, and the executive.

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:40.220
So, the time of session, what about the test time of the project?

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:43.100
So, the time of the polling point, what time of the polling point?

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.780
Oh, of course, the other minutes.

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:50.220
So, we would have time for the test session, and we would have time for the time of the test session.

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:55.220
Thank you very much, and I'll see you in the next one.

00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:20.840
you

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:50.840
you

00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:20.840
you

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:50.840
you

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:20.840
you

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:50.840
you

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:20.840
you

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:50.840
you

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:20.840
you

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:50.840
you

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:20.840
you

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:50.840
you

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:20.840
you

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:50.840
you

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:20.840
you

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:50.840
you

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:20.840
you

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:50.840
you

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:20.840
you

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:50.840
you

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:20.840
you

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:50.840
you

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:20.840
you

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:50.840
you

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:20.840
you

01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:50.840
you

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:20.840
you

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:50.840
you

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:20.840
you

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:50.840
you

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:20.840
you

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:50.840
you

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:20.840
you

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:50.840
you

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:20.840
you

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:50.840
you

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:20.840
you

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:50.840
you

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:20.840
you

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:50.840
you

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:20.840
you

01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:50.840
you

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:20.840
you

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:50.840
you

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:20.840
you

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:50.840
you

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:20.840
you

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:50.840
you

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:20.840
you

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:50.840
you

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:20.840
you

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:50.840
you

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:20.840
you

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:50.840
you

01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:20.840
you

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:50.840
you

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:20.840
you

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:50.840
you

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:20.840
you

01:27:50.220 --> 01:28:20.200
Thank you.

01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:50.200
Thank you.

01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:55.220
I'm going to start with the second question.

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:59.220
I'm going to first ask you to bring the second question to the area of some of these data

01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:02.220
sharing at 2.20.

01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.220
And this one will begin at the last minute.

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:12.220
We have one minute left to the interview, turn four, and one more time.

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:13.220
Thank you very much.

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:14.220
And we'll see you at 10.

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.220
Thanks, everyone.

01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.220
Thank you.

01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.220
in several other parts of the nation and also in theati and other parts of the world.

01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:22.220
Thank you.

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:29.220
.

01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:36.220
.

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:40.220
.

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:42.880
We've got a lot of different campuses and different places.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.960
We have a fair number of different places.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:46.680
And we're going to have to work on it.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:49.640
So I think we just probably should start at Cedric.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.140
So that's the answer, actually.

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:52.220
We're going to have to work on it.

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.880
And that's the other thing.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.760
Well, you can't really do anything about it.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.140
But it's a lot of different things.

01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.100
We just have to work on it.

01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.600
We'll talk to you later.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.580
So, yeah.

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:02.340
Thank you for that.

01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.460
And we have a really big presentation.

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:04.960
Oops.

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.460
It's not the end of it.

01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:07.960
Thank you.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.340
Thank you.

01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:13.340
I'll tell you a couple things about the questions.

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:20.340
We are having a glass table and we're trying to find the potential that you see more insurance costs.

01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:22.340
That's a good question.

01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:29.340
First I want to, so in the discussion panel we were talking about the rent.

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:39.340
And I said, kind of thinking that the transportation needs to be under different controls,

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:43.340
and I will go around that as a, of course, a study here,

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:48.340
where that basically will be people look at how those requirements are to do,

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:54.340
but it's not telling that people are still in the car,

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:59.900
So in the trial, the court decided to name the country and the house of control as the

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:05.920
immigration department of the way, and then we set up a new border line and then that

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.520
was the solution.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.420
Yeah.

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.080
Okay.

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.120
Thank you.

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:11.220
Thank you.

01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:13.580
Yeah, well, I think that's it.

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.320
And we're going to go to the court later.

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:15.820
Okay.

01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:16.320
Yeah.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:16.820
Thank you.

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:17.320
Thank you.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:17.980
Thank you.

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:18.480
Thank you.

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:18.980
Thank you.

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:19.480
Thank you.

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:19.980
Thank you.

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:20.480
Thank you.

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:20.980
Thank you.

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:21.480
Thank you.

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:21.980
Thank you.

01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:22.480
Thank you.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:22.980
Thank you.

01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.480
Thank you.

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:25.480
Hello, I'm your host, David.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.480
This is my first time doing this.

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:29.480
I'm going to show you how to do this.

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.480
We have a stand-up

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.480
and a stand-up

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.480
stand-up

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:37.480
stand-up

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.480
