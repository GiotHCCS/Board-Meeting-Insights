00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.620
you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.620
you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:59.980
Thank you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Thank you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So, we have a lot of things we want to see in the next year.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So, we have a lot of things we want to see in the next year.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and I'm going to go over a bit from just the actual design to complete or continue to do this kind of stuff.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Last this time I've done a commercial list of products and products that I've seen in the last year.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
With products like that I was able to continue to do this kind of stuff.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I'm going to do this this year. I'm trying to do it as the C-Series product, to do this.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Please go ahead, J. Paul.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Thanks, John.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Thank you very much.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Our military is an independent army.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And it hassoffice to our anniversary.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But we are dedicated to helping our wounded citizens,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
those who have been wounded by our army,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and the deaths for the crimes they have committed

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
in the past, which our army is always

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
in the picture for them.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And I'm going to say it just a minute.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I feel like you've got all the facts as you like.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And if I can, I would rather,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
well, I'm a government official.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.500
It's a little bit more.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.500
Yeah.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.000
There's a little bit more.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
There's a little bit more.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
There's a little bit more.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.500
So this is actually the same.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500
It's actually a similar version.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.900
But the only difference is that you're

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.000
going to have to see the two different ones before you

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.300
can actually do it this way.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.000
So the one that's in the middle is this one.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.500
And the black one is a little bit more.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500
This is the other thing that's in the middle.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.500
And it's a little bit different.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.000
But you're having to, essentially,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The recommendation is to go to the board with a vote on the pedigree.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
If the board thinks that it can continue in the dialogue, then we decide,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
which leads to a vote by the board, which is after the committee meeting.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
If the motion goes on, we'll stop the meeting and send it back to the board.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
If the committee can take the recommendation to the board, it's great.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So, I think the same thing is true for the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the work that we're doing, we're doing it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
to make sure that the experience

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
is as well as possible.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So, yes,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
we can do a lot of things for this

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
this week, and we've done this

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
over many days.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But the other thing is,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
this week's project is a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
it's a project

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that we're doing

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that we're doing

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and then we can make it well over and out of there.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Right.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Right.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But what about the right path?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Yeah.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
If you're in the right path, you should have a map.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Yeah.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
That's right.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So that's one of the things.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Yeah.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Okay.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Well, we're going to make this simple and do this again.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Okay.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Let's do it.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So this question would require, you're trying to say,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
it should probably match normal.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I don't want to just ask them to pass a reprimand to the questioner, as long as I don't call

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
them to this, I want them to have two minutes and then use my attention for it.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You know, you can call them to the questioner.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
But what I'm trying to do is I'm calling them to this, and I'm going to ask them to call

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
them to this.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So, I think that's my question is to my seniors, to my parents, to my people, my neighbors,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
to my friends, how do I adapt in the environment that we live in?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
How do I adapt to the world?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And how do I adapt to the world of my life?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Whether or not you know too much, there are many things that you can do to adapt to the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to the department of health and the district.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Of course, the district is not the one that's responsible.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We are having a new guy on the job,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and we're going to be able to get him to work in the unit.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We're going to have to do that.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
That's what four years I was doing.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And then, for the student property's code,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
we're going to have to do all the prioritizing

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
for the money that it's going to take.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And when we're done with the data,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
we're going to take that time off

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
to see if something's going to go right.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the conference came and they were having some interviews at Medicaid, so that was a product

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that's going to be actually interesting to see what's going on.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Thank you.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Dr. Aram.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Thank you.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Yes, from the back end, from 20 to 21 million, I'm sure you cannot count on 20 million

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
working on a job like that.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000
But the next three years, the guys will be coming back to welcome students and get their

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And then if you want to put them on the side, put them on the top.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then, you can have it for the next session or the next.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And then, if you want to make a whole zone, you can add two different blocks.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And then, you can add a single block.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And then, you can have a big group here.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And then, you can have a big group here.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So, you can have a big group here.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.100
Thank you.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.880
It's a good day.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.320
It's awesome to work here.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.000
Thanks.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.800
Noë“¤uy Glaser

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.460
Thank you.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.140
Okay can you start ?

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.260
Sorry no next meeting soon.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.760
Hello.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.260
Hi there.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.440
How are you?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:20.940
Hello.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.440
Hello.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.940
Hello.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.740
Hi there.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.420
Hi there.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:38.400
We're gonna turn the next schedule to a QC S&S

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.400
I think, especially with the stuff that we're doing, we should have a discussion about it.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.400
We should have a discussion about it.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.400
That's probably a question that I would hold.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.400
Thank you.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400
Thank you.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.400
Thank you.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400
Yeah.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.400
And I just wanted to say, we'll talk later.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.400
We'll be next week, and I'll see you in the next year or two,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.400
to have a conversation with you.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400
Okay.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400
Thank you.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400
Thank you.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400
Thank you.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.020
you

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.020
you

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.020
you

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.020
you

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.020
you

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.020
you

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.020
you

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.020
you

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.020
you

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.020
you

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.020
you

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.020
you

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.020
you

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.020
you

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.020
you

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.020
you

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.020
you

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.020
you

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.020
you

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.020
you

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.020
you

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.020
you

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.020
you

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.020
you

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.020
you

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.020
you

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.020
you

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.020
you

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.020
you

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.020
you

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.020
you

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.020
you

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.020
you

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.020
you

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.020
you

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.020
you

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.020
you

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.020
you

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.020
you

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.020
you

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.020
you

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.020
you

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.020
you

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.020
you

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.020
you

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.020
you

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.020
you

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:35.380
Thank you.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.400
As I was explaining earlier, we had a schedule all the way up to June.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:47.400
All the special day we're at, like I said, we're at 8 o'clock, so that's probably the best time to be in the city.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.400
We can continue on this, but we're going to be on this plane.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.400
The rest of the, the rest of the time is our first one.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.400
We're going to be able to escape to London and then we'll be able to go to Israel.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.400
So you know, we're not going to be able to travel, so we're going to be able to go to Israel.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:10.400
And the agency report has been actually asked by the Ministry, especially with the report

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.400
specifically submitted to them.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.400
There are probably, in fact, any reports that have been written to report it this time,

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.400
which we can confirm is a pilot.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.400
Thank you.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.400
Thank you.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400
Thank you.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.400
This question is with the proposed measure for 2020.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.400
Question, please.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.400
Thank you.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.400
Thank you.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.400
Thank you.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.400
Thank you.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.400
Thank you.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.400
Thank you.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.400
Thank you.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:55.440
So, today I'm going to introduce you to the

00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.440
which is why we're all here, and I think it's important for you to be a part of this.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:05.440
So, if you want to participate in the conference, you need to get to the building.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.440
And we're not going to have a big meeting, because it's a very short one.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.440
And, from that point on, we're going to keep going with this progress,

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.440
but we're going to keep working on that, and we're going to keep trying to keep this going.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.440
There are a number of other things that we will see as well,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.440
but this is what we expect.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:34.440
In the next year, we are interested in the new programming

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.440
and the acoustic theater, actual, and original engine.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.440
That's what we're looking for.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:45.440
So we have the connection as well as the description.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.440
I'm sorry I'm not as upset as you guys.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.440
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to find me on Twitter.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.440
I'm trying to look at it on the phone right now.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.440
But thank you for your support.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.440
So, anyway, I'm Steve Jarvis.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.440
I'm a co-founder of the PlayMedia Center.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.440
And that's me and Steve.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.440
And we're all in this country now.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.440
We're all in this country.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.440
And with all of the East Asian support,

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:17.440
The city's board of directors are in charge of educating and helping to provide support to the

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:23.440
advertising owners and the restaurants for the kids here.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.440
As Pat named it, the city is in charge of the city.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:33.440
We are in charge of supporting the city's entertainment, and supporting the local community.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.440
The staff is in charge of the sports and the basketball side.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:38.980
Okay.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.120
So, if you want to follow up on this, you can.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.140
It depends on what the number is.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.220
From 0 to 646, actually, or 648.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.500
It is 0.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.260
0.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:51.760
0.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.260
0.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:52.760
0.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.260
0.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:53.760
0.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.260
0.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:54.760
0.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.260
0.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:55.760
0.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.260
0.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:56.760
0.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.260
0.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:57.760
0.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.260
0.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.760
0.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.260
0.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:35:59.760
0.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.260
0.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:00.760
0.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.260
0.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:01.760
0.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.260
0.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:02.760
0.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.260
0.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:03.760
0.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.260
0.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:04.760
0.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.260
0.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:05.760
0.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.260
0.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:06.760
0.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.260
0.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:07.760
0.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:14.060
And we also, we should also have a point of reference in the community for our

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:20.860
population to know what's happening with us and the countries.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:26.860
Because we are in a country that's not convinced of the first time.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.860
I think that's a good point.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.860
I think that's a good point.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.860
I think that's a good point.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.860
I think that's a good point.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:40.860
I want to say that we are at a place to be at, and we're at a place to be at.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:46.860
The Department of Health has had some warning, and we're going to come out with a down message

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.860
to all folks about 17 years. And I think the language is appropriate for the administration

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.860
to have a budget purchase order to run your home as a result of your disease.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:59.860
Part of the promise is that if you're not going to have a sporting benefit, please have a routine.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.100
there is a particular demand in September of 2045.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.260
The reason I'm not having a gender difference list

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.460
is because of the corporate opportunity

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.260
to avoid actual conflict where we can hear out the truth

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.260
and the point is to take ourselves to the line

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.660
and then to take some policy changes.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.460
This is part of our work.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.460
We're going to be taking questions.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.260
And I think that's a very important position

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.260
that you're going to have to take.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.260
Thank you.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.260
Thank you.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.260
Thank you.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.260
Thank you.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.260
Thank you.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.260
Thank you very much.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.260
Thank you.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.260
Thank you very much.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.260
Thank you.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.260
Thank you.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.260
Thank you.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.260
Thank you.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.260
Yes, and the next one is from the HRC.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.260
The next question is from the National Health Service and the National Health Service.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.260
The next one is from John Corris.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.260
Hi.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.260
My name is John Corris and I am from the New York City Health Service.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:58.900
fire, which was a target of the 12th of September in 2K, is the incursion of the fire

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:05.460
orders across the system. I can't wait for this question. What will we do? Is there an

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:11.220
answer to the question? I know we've got two goals for 2000, but we have the economy

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:16.980
but it could never be solved. So it's a safety difference, the important building systems.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:20.980
I'm sorry, this is a question that I really want to answer in the chat.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.980
Okay, I'm hoping that we can answer.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.980
I think we can. I'm hoping that the trick is really correct.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.980
We have open selection process that we are going to have to work on.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.980
It shows what does the selection look like.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:41.980
We are going to have to make drawings and then put in a place where we can see what's in the circle.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.980
I look forward to that.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.980
I'm nice for the day-to-day.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.480
And I have a lot of things to do.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.980
And I'm about to go on a weekend.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.980
I'll give you a chance to look at it.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.980
Just one quick question.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.980
I have a city tour from London.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.980
Chris actually is a teacher at school.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.980
I have a study course.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.980
So I have a few of my big things to do.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.980
So I'm looking at two things.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.340
to monitor the emission of these machines.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.060
Excellent.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.020
Thank you.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:15.940
Thank you.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.220
Thank you very much.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.900
You have a very good opportunity to ask questions.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:27.380
Well, after the recording, we'll see if you can make any questions.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.060
You can ask any questions.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.340
Yes, we can.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:30.840
Okay.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.980
Thank you.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:46.980
In accordance with what I think is the first time that we've presented to the College Board of Trustees,

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.980
we're going to establish a plan for the August 4th academic completion of the test,

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.980
and the beginning of the next year.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.980
We've got two stations there to,

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.980
that is, to meet the requirements of how long for the organization is in charge of

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.980
the estimated attending requests.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:13.980
This works for many, depending on your public life, and there are a lot of communities in

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.980
America that are doing telehealth in the world.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:24.980
And the school policy will apply for the correct scholarships selected by the PDD for $500,000.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:30.980
And the private school education is for $2,500.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:37.980
And this month, we've laid out the program funding for banks in Costillo, which is $400.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.980
That'll be the main column for the $500.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.980
The bank will get short games on the streets, which means they'll get $400 for sure, that's the outfit.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.980
And we'll give you some of the funding for the foundation, but we'll give you that for $3,000.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.980
So the funding for today's foundation is $1,600.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.380
and we're going to be able to ask the data to fill you

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.820
whether we are wanting to close the month of May

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.060
to establish a trial date for the next month.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:07.760
The history of AI for AI for Non-Circumstance Association

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.600
again, it's a very interesting topic.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.300
I think it's a great topic and I want to thank you

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.200
and thank you to our sponsor,

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.540
the Non-Circumstance Association

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.800
and the Professional Development Association

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.180
for putting so good a value on the policy of AI.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.180
the college has received this request over the years.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:31.180
And as well as the request for the National League,

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.180
we have a bid to be held October 13th to the 15th.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.180
And the benefactor level bid is the college.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.180
The special recognition and the admission fee for the year

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:45.180
is $3,000.00, and the check-in receipt is $3,000.00.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.180
And the last one is that claim lottery.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:52.180
And that request fell on $5,600.00,

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.580
which means that we'll add an additional $40 million for the benefit of our

00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.980
industry to use in our communities. This means that we'll provide funding

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.980
also for our scholarships to students in the public schools.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:09.780
And we have a number of other initiatives that you're approval of.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.280
Right.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.680
And, questions?

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.180
No.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:12.680
Okay.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.180
Thank you.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:13.680
Thank you.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.180
Thank you.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:14.680
Thank you.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.180
Thank you.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:15.680
Thank you.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.180
Thank you.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:16.680
Thank you.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.180
Thank you.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:17.680
Thank you.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.180
Thank you.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:18.680
Thank you.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.180
Thank you.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:19.680
Thank you.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.180
Thank you.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:20.680
Thank you.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.180
Thank you.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.680
Thank you.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:27.680
Okay, so three next steps. The first one is to get first-aid kit before the study.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:38.680
The first-aid kit for the study is probably a one-time admission card.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:44.680
So, the second one is to get your key, if you get your key at the university,

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.680
to all these members that need to make changes in the company, in the state department,

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:56.680
in the county, in the town, in the state department, to support other existing research boards,

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:05.680
to open up a base, a base that they can support the research across the university to increase

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:12.680
the range of community college program. So, there's been a question to how well can we

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:19.680
that the conference has extended to me, which I greatly appreciate. And I'm so excited about

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.680
the conference. So, it's not long yet to come. I know that there's some summer, new year

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:31.680
days, and standard times. I've talked a lot about the National Annual Conference in Washington,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:37.680
D.C., the World Health Center, and then the several other AISD chapters, which indeed

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:46.680
So we did a lot of research in this regard. We did a lot of research on the military and on the African-American soldiers and also the African-American soldiers in particular.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.680
So we did a lot of research on the military and on the African-American soldiers in particular.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:59.680
And we did a study with the AIB and other companies to kind of go in and see if we could actually pass through the list of like the more elite in 16 or 17 schools across the country,

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.880
to this particular code word and that was a finished assessment issue and so I don't

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.480
know if this came up at all.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:11.080
The criminal travel, I don't know if I said he, the criminal theft coverage, I don't know

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.280
if it came up or not, but it came up.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.380
It came up in the past week at the end of the month, I think it was.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:22.280
But I think one of the items that we're taking to support those practices, lots of resources

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.880
that we're devised for us, there's quite a bit of work that can be done to select the

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:34.560
and I think it's very important for us to have a lot of opportunities to do this as a cost

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.600
and a very efficient way to do the work force.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.120
And the family Texas workforce conference.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:46.320
That's right, this is the ASML and the workforce forum.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.400
And I would be particularly interested in having a work conference because it's a very important

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.640
which we'll talk to you soon. It's a fabulous project and we're looking forward to it.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:03.360
And we'll be sure to also, again, forward to the minister. We ask you to leave the minister

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.960
and get back to him.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.560
Okay. Thank you.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.440
And then we'll talk to you soon. You're most welcome.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.440
Thank you.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.440
Thank you.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.440
Thank you.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.440
Thank you.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.440
Thank you.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:28.480
as well. We just followed the procedure as we had it. So this one I think we're going to do

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:35.840
on the next slide. I just want to start with the order of the day. As you know, we do have

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.960
a lot of time to get the findings and other stuff. Can I just say a couple of things that

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:46.320
we didn't have these questions for me to know? How long did you take to test this order?

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.520
is to go to the police station and search. So in the works they would call the police

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.320
and they would go to the police station and they would keep checking if there was a person

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:59.320
who was in the same street as them. And so the police would come in and they would walk

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:04.320
down the street and search again and so you can't get away with it. And they'd take

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:10.320
out their assistant and they'd go to the health station. So now in the case that you have

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.320
a health center, most of the time you don't have to go to the health center because they

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.320
typically do this on Friday, Tuesday, the board actually says this is the only way for the

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:26.600
board to respond to it. This new law was now in, in like, March, March 5th, and the

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:32.840
one that she was then doing was on Wednesday before it changed to Monday. And so, the

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.120
government passed that, and that's where the law and the government just started to

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.640
fix it up, and the chances of it being true is that only people who may have been

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.140
um, keep going and stop the process and stuff like that.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:48.140
But I'm looking to make, I'm going to make this a little more scary because this is a little bit easier.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:52.140
I'm going to do a little, share the questions and answers, what are the things that you can say

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.140
and I'll just work my way up to know what experience there is.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.140
I'm sure there are a lot of people who are going to be doing this, beginning with this one, not four.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:05.140
So, the answer is this is another one that, you know, I think is a really good example of this.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:12.140
It's the moment that I was, sometimes I have to press the other side of the screen, so it was a very hard time for me.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:21.140
I don't know if you've heard, but I'm saying that there are two screen editors, one is a school student, and the other one is a student.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:26.140
And they're in the same degree, but the four of them have the same quality.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.140
So they're pretty close.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:33.140
managers before the internet went off. Like, that was the number 11.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:37.140
Because they were pushing the internet out of the game, plus they were calling it.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:44.140
So, you're actually being too loud, just when you touch your phone on the internet.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:48.140
Or, you can do a WhatsApp call to your phone and it's going to be like,

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.140
it's on the same internet as you, it's a different device.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:56.140
So, I don't feel like the internet is the same thing as it used to be,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.140
So, again, there are some other problems.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.140
And there are more and more problems.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:08.140
And this is why we decided not to prepare it at all,

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.140
and we must be very quick and think about the government.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.140
And also, I might be the most interesting,

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.140
but the whole idea is that it's a very important thing.

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:19.140
So, of course, we have to say that we think that that's the logic.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.140
We have to be very quick and think about the government.

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:29.140
Well, we're looking forward to getting to something that could happen in January with the storm stats that are in the S.A.P.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:38.140
which there is a new receipt that would be made at the top and so now we're talking about the new report that we're seeing.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:49.140
And that's making sure that we're getting everything to see. So I think that we need to know prior to the event that we're looking to buy and sell.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:54.140
So, you mentioned the contact.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:49:02.140
Well, the contact, you know, we do the same in which we found each other and actually

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:09.140
tried to get into discussions. We wanted to get into this in the first time. So, you know,

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:13.140
there's like thousands of things that we talked about. And then we would see if our

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:21.380
I think it's not necessary to have a workshop with the

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.020
technical and the other people.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.020
Thank you.

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.020
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.020
I think that's it.

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.020
I think that's it.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.020
I think that's it.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.020
I think that's it.

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.020
I think that's it.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.020
I think that's it.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.740
to be able to do this.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:44.580
So it's not only a question of how it works,

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.040
it's actually a question of what is it?

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.660
This broad question is, you know,

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.180
the US side and Canada, I mean, should we

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.460
have the international organization

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:57.400
to try to make sure that the plastic is kept for a long time?

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.940
So this is a follow-up question.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:03.060
To put this something out there on the air,

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:09.960
as we have the distribution now, and to not be understandable

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.540
So this could be an issue in the future.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:19.080
We're going to talk about it, but I just want to point out that we're saying maybe we need to make that proportion

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.880
of the data out to the next year.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:27.640
We're looking at two to three years and three recesses, probably, to stand.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.840
Thank you.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:37.080
I was wondering, since you're taking this on your own, I think it is important to look at the cost of requirements

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:42.080
But I think it's a nice resource. It's a resource that we use.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.080
We don't engage our learning back to the beginning course.

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.080
But the previous experience is really good and standardized and it's so good.

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:52.080
And we're using it on so many different courses.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:51:00.080
So we have millions of students along, so many young, but there's just no general concept of it.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.080
So, we don't have the same entertainment. It's the same here.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:11.080
the difference between the Australian and the British government is that the British government says that

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.080
all the people are going to be fine with the government.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:20.080
And you know, the problem is that the British government is not particularly aware of the relationship

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:25.080
with the government and can't understand the convenience of that.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:30.080
We have to be sustainable and we don't have the best information and the most useful.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.080
So that's just one of the common reasons that we're here.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.080
I think it's a pretty good point.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.080
The first thing to do is to fill in the workshop

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.080
and then try to reference the current projects

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080
that you're working on.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.080
The way I do it properly is to do it

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.080
in a very simple way.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.080
I don't know if it's really on the table

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.080
but I'm going to be applying to the

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.080
the Department of Environmental Research

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.080
and the U.S. Department of Research

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.080
to do a little bit of work on it.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.080
That's why I think it's kind of a

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:08.080
to remind the original statesman or whatever that the local city has the potential and the strength to look for

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.080
a new machine if there's free air going away.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:17.080
So there are no stable notebooks that will have to be changed for the new one.

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:27.080
The new one can have the same kind of experience, the projects, the meet, the changes, and the stuff.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:33.080
if you look at all the different communities that you can have in the state of California,

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.080
which is a community that we want to be able to work with,

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.080
so that we can work with other communities.

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.080
And I think that's really important.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:45.080
And from a youth-based point of view, I think that's a strong point.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.080
And that's true for the national state of California.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:50.080
And I think that's really important, especially for the community.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.080
I think that's really important for the community.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.080
And I think that's really important for the community.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:53:00.800
and we eat the farm. And I will say also we recently had a workshop, workshop met in

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.160
London in the previous round of growth phase and now the two weeks of that are still there.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:13.440
And we will be doing two to three days onward in the coming weeks to meet again with more

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.400
farmers and even kind of talk with the big farmers about it. So you can start with all

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.960
the different things in terms of how to work it and then you're able to go forward with

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.920
So, he would do something like that.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.680
That's it.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.300
I think that's the only way to do it.

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.140
So, you're saying the world is going to take meaning

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.300
to take meaning out of the end, right?

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:35.620
And, that's what's coming back to other business people.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.360
Yes, it is good.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.520
I'm not asking a question.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.320
I'm going to read my mind.

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.480
I just want to say that the procedure

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.600
that has been required for us is that we're going to use

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.800
the chapter before the 15th.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:51.800
So, it's a very long road.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:56.800
So, I actually think that we're going to have a lot more overall,

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.800
you know, the resource for our budget,

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.800
because for our budget, the financial needs,

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.800
we're going to be at $4.15 million in price,

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.800
and that's going to come with policy.

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.800
I can tell you that, you know,

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.800
I don't know anybody who's been looking at this

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.800
and going, oh, that's a piece of it.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.800
So, we need to work with the state government to help them to really manage everything that's

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.800
happening in the whole respect of our own people and our own country.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:25.800
But what can I do?

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.800
That's all right.

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.800
I see what you mean.

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.800
That's all right.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.800
It's all for the public.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.800
Of course.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.800
I'm happy to help.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.800
Thank you.

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.800
Thank you.

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.800
Yes.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.800
Yes, please.

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.800
Yes, I have a question.

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:37.800
Yes, I am.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.800
Yes, you are.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:39.800
Yes, I'm.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800
Yes, I'm.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.800
Yes, I'm.

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.800
Yes, I'm.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.800
Yes, I'm.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.800
Yes, I'm.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.800
Yes, I'm.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.800
And then the next level is that we'll be doing, we're going to be doing, for this semester,

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.800
four taught meetings, sharing that with the class members, and that will be in the sixth

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.800
and fifth level.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.800
So you're going to be doing the first one, the fourth, the fifth, all six of you.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.800
And again, you'll be doing a lot of things in the first year, so you're going to have

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.800
a lot of fun and experience a lot, so you're going to get some good feedback.

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:13.800
And, um, what we're going to do next is we're going to be doing some more of these

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:21.800
And that's the third and final step that we're going to do in the summer.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:25.800
The second is direct college school summer.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:30.800
So we have all the workshops together and we're going to be doing some of the work.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:37.800
Or, we've really not considered just teaching at our home, which includes maybe having a college for 20 or 30 years to study for.

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.800
So we're going to have to put that in the classroom and then we're going to have to do some work

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.800
because of the virtual nature. So, we're launching this for the people.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.800
I'm just going to have a look forward.

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.800
Okay.

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.800
And then you know how much time we can use this project?

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.800
Because I think it's different.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.800
Now, if we use a workshop, I know that we will have a great day.

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.800
Now, as you can see, we have a very interesting project,

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.800
and it's very, very, very exciting to look at.

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.600
and we have a program called the C-A-L-T-E-R-E,

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.540
and we've been introducing some of the next

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.100
programs that we've helped to develop.

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.480
How do you just, can you just kind of

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.960
update things, because we're only just

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.240
moving out of the business,

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.600
and we're just moving out of the industry.

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.940
Well, I was just talking about the fact that

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.480
we're moving out of the industry,

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:28.280
and we're moving out of the industry, right?

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.860
So, we're moving out of the industry,

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.160
and we're moving out of the industry.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.920
And we're moving out of the industry.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:51.700
So, we have two different types of

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.860
I think for nutritional farmers,

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.080
we didn't just build the current social environment

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.700
but we also decided to build the environmental we thought

00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.820
we would.

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:01.860
And then we changed off the flyings

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:03.280
and we added less into the trash

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.100
from January until November last year.

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.780
We did a cash profit, but that didn't help us

00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:10.660
until we got a lot of the money back from the phase

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.560
we were building.

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.620
So we didn't have to trade at all.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.100
So we just kept working in the same time.

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.620
That's where I believe.

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.320
you

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:52.320
you

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:22.320
you

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:52.320
you

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:22.320
you

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:52.320
you

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.320
you

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:52.320
you

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.320
you

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:52.320
you

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:22.320
you

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.320
you

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:22.320
you

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.320
you

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.320
you

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.320
you

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.320
you

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:52.320
you

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.320
you

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.320
you

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.320
you

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:52.320
you

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:22.319
you

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:52.319
you

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.319
you

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:52.319
you

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.320
you

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:52.320
you

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.320
you

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.320
you

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.320
you

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:52.320
you

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:22.320
you

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.320
you

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:22.320
you

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:52.320
you

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:22.320
you

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.320
you

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:22.320
you

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:52.320
you

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.320
you

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:52.320
you

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:22.320
you

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.320
you

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:22.320
you

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.320
you

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:22.320
you

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:52.320
you

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:22.320
you

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:52.320
you

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.320
you

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:52.320
you

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:22.320
you

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.320
you

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:22.320
you

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:52.320
you

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.320

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:52.320
you

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:22.320
you

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:52.320
you

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:22.320
you

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:52.320

01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:52.320
you

01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:22.320
you

01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:52.320
you

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:22.320
you

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.320
you

01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:22.320
you

01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:52.320
you

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:22.320
you

01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:52.320
you

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:22.320

you

01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:52.320
you

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:22.320
you

01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:52.320
you

01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:22.320
you

01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:52.320
you

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:22.320
you

01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:52.320
you

01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:22.320
you

01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:52.320
you

01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:22.320
you

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:52.320
you

01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:22.320
you

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:52.320

01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:22.320
you

01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:52.320
you

01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:22.320
you

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:52.320
you
