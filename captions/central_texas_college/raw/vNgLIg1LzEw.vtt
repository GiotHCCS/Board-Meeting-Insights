00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.620
you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.620
you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:59.980
Thank you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Thank you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So, we have a lot of things we want to see in the next year.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So, we have a lot of things we want to see in the next year.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.300
and the other one which is on just the actual design to come today, but continue to do this

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.800
in kind of a smaller way.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.500
Lastest time, I was also blessed to go out to students to look at my own class, but with

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.500
the fact that I'm going to continue to look at my own class, I'm going to do this as soon

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500
as I can.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm trying to do it as efficiently as I can to do it in a way that's more effective.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.020
Sir, please mention your name, sir.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.440
My name is Shcutil, sir.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.380
Your name is Shcutil?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.720
Mr. Shcutil.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.020
Ok.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.480
And your name is Shketl?

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.340
Shketl.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.180
Yes, and what is your name sir?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.840
Mr. Shketl.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.540
What is your name?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.940
Shketl.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.700
What is your name sir?

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.320
Shketl.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.040
What is your name?

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.580
Shketl.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.720
Where do you come from?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.520
Mr. Shketl.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.980
How do you feel Mr. Shketl?

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.580
I have a question Mrs. Shketl.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.880
Yes, all right.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.700
Mr. Shketl.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:22.140
So, if I can just finish speaking with you, so I'm, I'm, always immersed in a Hall,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.040
yeah, and you're there, but on a build out site, you're, you're a commander's,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.900
you're in control of this base, you know, what I mean, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.620
I'm always, always, always, always a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.760
Yeah.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.820
Okay, good.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.880
Thanks for talking to us.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.920
It's always an honor to talk to you and thanks for being here.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.960
It's always an honor to talk to you and thank you, and thank you very much.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.080
Thank you very much.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.160
Thank you very much.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.260
All right, all right, thanks very much.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.280
Thank you very much.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.580
Bye-bye.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.760
Bye-bye.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.220
Bye-bye.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.560
Bye-bye.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.760
Bye-bye.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.820
Bye-bye.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.820
So, what do you think of this?

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.820
In particular, I think the federal government is working closely with the government on

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.820
the development of the green.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.820
The federal government is continuing on the design of green for the next year.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.820
So, it's a different perspective.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.820
And, it's also a different perspective, if you look at some of the benefits of the green

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.820
I think that's a great point of action to make. We want to be prepared.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:10.820
We're hoping that the consumer first comes and we're able to make a commitment to be strong and to be as balanced as we can be.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.820
So, we have different ways in which we can do that.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.820
So, we can make a system.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.820
We can make a system that is just a way to do it.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.820
We can use a software to do it without, you know,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.820
application and stuff.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.820
So, we might be able to do it without the release

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.820
of the data that we have.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.820
And we can make it, you know, a very good

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.820
engineering system.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.820
So, we can have a lot of applications.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.820
We can have a lot of applications

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.820
that we can use.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.820
And also, we can use a lot of

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.820
Okay.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.820
Okay.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.820
Well, I'm going to do a discussion question.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.820
This morning.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.820
This morning.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.820
This is required of me, sir.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.820
Sorry.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.820
It's required of me as well.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.820
I don't want to take the last one because it actually represents an expression

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.820
assigned by the president.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.820
There's a moment in our previous Senate, and I just want to give a small correction.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.820
But, you know, you're always having a bad experience.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.820
So, what I'm trying to tell you is that,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.820
the quality of your success is what matters.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.820
And that's why I'm saying that the quality of your success is what matters.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.820
So, I'm saying that, I guess my question is to,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.820
when I say you're balanced,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.820
I'm talking about the idea of a community,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.820
how is that impacting your communities?

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.320
and there's a lot of data that we're using,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.320
and people can make these things out of their own lives.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.820
But whether or not it's a key or a tool,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.320
it's a new business,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.320
and we're going to have to look at all the times

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.820
that this has to be developed from a general position.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.820
Of course, business is not the only thing that's different.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.320
Now, I'm not going to be telling you

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.320
that I shouldn't have been able to do it,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.820
because I'm not being able to do it.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.820
I just have to admit,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.820
just before you found out about it,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.020
And then for the student property's code, we're going to ask them all to prioritize

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.820
the automatic product and what we're trying to navigate.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.820
And then we can take that time off to say, can we go right behind the property's code

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.820
and then we can have extra minutes at the end of the week so that we can have a better

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.820
product that's going to be able to get through the years.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.820
And so, I think the type of work that we're going to do is we're going to have to do some

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.820
20 to 20 million dollars, which you cannot pay 20 to 20 million dollars to get that back, but

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.820
the middle three, the 24 million, I'm talking about the local student,

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.820
and the 54 million, the 5 million, the 6 million, the 7 million, and yet,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.820
I can't even find it. That's too short.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.500
But don't worry about that. It's not that bad.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.860
But it's nice to know that you are still here.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.860
And I'm happy to see you again.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.220
I'm happy to see you again.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.220
Thank you.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.220
Thank you.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.500
And have a nice weekend.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.500
Thank you.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.580
Okay.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:25.380
Well, I just want to show you probably head of that, I had a really good one yesterday.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.960
You know, we're trying to do a schedule for the physio, a last minute shift, 12 through

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:36.980
the 3, and we have to go, you know, four days on the 24th, that focusing on the economy,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.260
The second is I'm really getting my work done.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.180
So, I'm really excited for the future of the US.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.100
And I'm really excited to see if there's a chance I can get involved.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.540
That's probably a question that I could think of.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.740
Well, thank you.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.740
It's a good topic.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.060
I mean, it's, it's, you know, it's not, not, not happening today.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.660
But we're really looking forward to having a little bit more sharing in the future,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.340
and doing some interesting stuff.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.340
I'm really excited for that.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.340
Thank you.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.340
Thank you.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.340
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:35.960
you

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:05.960
you

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:35.960
you

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:05.960
you

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:35.960
you

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:05.960
you

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:35.960
you

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:05.960
you

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:35.960
you

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:05.960
you

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:35.960
you

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:05.960
you

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.960
you

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:05.960
you

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:35.960
you

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:05.960
you

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:35.960
you

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:05.960
you

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:35.960
you

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:05.960
you

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:35.960
you

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.960
you

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:35.960
you

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:05.960
you

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:35.960
you

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:05.960
you

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:35.960
you

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:05.960
you

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:35.960
you

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:05.960
you

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:35.960
you

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:05.960
you

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:35.960
you

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:05.960
you

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:35.960
you

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:05.960
you

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:35.960
you

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:05.960
you

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:35.960
you

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:05.960
you

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:35.960
you

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:05.960
you

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:35.960
you

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:05.960
you

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:35.960
you

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:05.960
you

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:35.960
you

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:35.320
Thank you.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.340
As I said to you earlier, we understand you all have a way of the same.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:44.340
All the special data we're at, like the same player,

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.340
had one of the same, much of the same, probably the best in the world.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.340
We can continue on with that.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.340
We can continue on with planning.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:57.340
The best, uh, the best way I can start planning for the rest of the year is to expand to one of the,

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.340
uh, the best of the best roles.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.340
So you know, we're not going to do two changes.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.340
Yes, that's correct.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:10.340
And the answer report is the direct view as to the legislation, especially with the public

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.340
policy decision that came forward.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:16.340
There are probably, in fact, any questions that are left until the report is finished,

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.340
we can continue to find them.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.340
Yes.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.340
Thank you.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.340
The discussion over the proposed measures for the re-election is still ongoing.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.340
Thank you.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.340
So we're pushing this to the UK, of course, with our participants.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:37.340
We're also at the China stations, and Japan is planning on this trip.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.340
And the Commission agrees on it.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.340
I believe in the South, and this is the most important thing,

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.340
because we're all about the same thing.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.340
And we're all working together to make the best of it.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:54.340
But we do not have the same sense of what we're asking of the Chinese leaders.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:34:01.340
the new technology that we have, the new technology that we have in the factory, and so, as well,

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:06.340
as you can imagine, we're ready to do this, we're ready to do this, and we're not going

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:13.340
to have a pandemic here, we're going to do this in a while, so, um, we're going to be

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:19.340
doing this in a much longer time than we're going to be doing this in the next 10 years

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:25.840
or with other findings that we'll be seeing,

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:32.060
that will help us to take a look at the new technology.

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.920
And I think that will be a good way

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.639
to move into the holistic data and actual data

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:41.659
management in the future.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:45.500
So we have the connection as well as the description.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.500
So, I'm going to run a little bit of a summary of the attacks.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:54.500
I'm going to run some micrograms here, and I'm going to run a little bit of a time frame.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.500
I'm going to have to catch my eyes open.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.500
So, we have the United States Army, which first started as a plane in the Soviet Union.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:08.500
And that's been submitted to the United States Army in this country now.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:14.500
And then with the East Asian support, I can answer that.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.500
So I'm a continued candidate.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.500
I'm going to be close to the next meeting.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.500
I'm going to be in the House.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.500
That's my answer to that.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.500
Thank you.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.500
As Pat mentioned, he came in from the team at the Senate.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.500
He's going to be on the Senate Supreme Court for three years in January.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.500
He's going to sit in the room with the Blackboard committee.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.500
Now, the size of the computer is 6.8 inches.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.500
So, that's a good number.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.500
So, that's a good number.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.500
Now, the budget comes from the governor's.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.500
Now, the budget comes from the governor's.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.500
We're all 6.6, actually.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.500
6.8.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.500
We're all 6.6, actually.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.500
Now,

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.500
now we have to do our changes.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.500
Now, now we have to do our changes.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.500
We have to go up to the point of use.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.500
We have to go up to the point of use.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:08.500
So I'm impressed with the history, the remaining numbers in the newspaper, the better reports, the other one.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:15.500
And you know, there are a lot of celebrities who are still around, but in the end, it's all about the security, right?

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.500
Yeah, the security.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.500
And then on the other side, the gospel, the country.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.500
And that's amazing, because they're still being told the truth.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:35.500
First time, second time, third time, fourth time, fifth time, sixth time, seventh time,

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.500
eighth time, ninth time, eleventh time, twelfth time, twelfth time, twelfth time, twelfth time,

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.500
twenty-five years ago.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.500
Thank you.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.500
Mr. Chairman, thank you for your interest.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.500
I'm going to come in with John Mishkin, one of the first, one of the first members.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.500
I think the language of the president's administration is that he will build a purpose

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.500
to run your foreign policy business in partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense,

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.500
or you have a pre-settlement date.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.500
There is a pre-settlement date on September 1, 2014.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.500
If a pre-settlement date is due to be dismissed,

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.500
or if the care of a corporate is overturned,

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.500
or if a contract will be re-opened for trade,

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.500
and the court is to take a shift to allow an FTC policy to be re-opted,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.500
this panel, by the way, will be able to do the questions.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.720
I'm going to go to the next session, right?

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.480
I should go ahead and go ahead and do it.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.780
I should go ahead and do it.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.580
I should go ahead and go ahead and do it.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.580
I should go ahead and do it.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.300
So today we're going to be talking about HMC and how

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.520
people can get involved with the HMC.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.440
And you know, CIDIC's project is called

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.040
and also our management equipment for the new market.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.040
And that's how we have a twisted target.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.240
As for the 2016 market, it appears in question

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.440
that there are five other special systems

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.240
that will be in force to assure that we are

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.240
on the right path.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:10.040
And actually, we actually never got to the 15,000

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.840
or not the economy, but to another side.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.040
So, it's a safety difference.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.040
very important building systems.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.040
I have a few questions but I'm really going to leave it to you, Caroline.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.040
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and begin.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.040
So the question I came to, how will the architecture be developed?

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:33.040
We have a problem selection process that we are going to have to work down the charts

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.040
with the other departments and with the philosophy.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:42.040
But, um, the question is, do I have to work with the class mechanisms and so forth,

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.040
I look forward to that.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.040
I also remember dealing with the internet,

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:53.040
I had a huge difficulty at the 1 or 2.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.040
I think it's very important to find partners

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.040
in the city to work with the church actually.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.040
If the church is the office of Tony Cruz,

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.040
I think that's a really good opportunity

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.040
to try and do that together.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.040
Two of the times I've been on the call

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:15.680
And then we will show you the last machine, which is actually a little bit more like a

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.680
little bit more expensive.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.680
And here is the one with the packaging on the back.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.680
So, after that, you will put the back in and see if it is going to be able to fit.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.680
And that's it.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.680
And then you can see how it fits.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:38.680
Does that answer your question?

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.780
Yes.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.020
Do you want to...

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:41.640
Okay.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.180
How quickly ...

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.440
so I can get your knowledge,

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.180
all the history here.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.640
You know, I am alone on this panel focus

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.020
close and partial to.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.940
You know, just sort of clear,

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:56.040
well, we do not poster cause

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.140
and no evidence community

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.580
for the protection of protection

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:06.860
organizations in charge of submitting a funding request. This partnership can be

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:14.260
determined by the request and there are a lot of input, really the information

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:19.020
comes in, coming back in from all of us. And the school closing will probably be for the

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:25.220
current scholarship selected by the community, it's going to be about $500-$500.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:31.080
and I'm going to show you what the actual cost of the foundation is for $12,000 per dollar.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.120
I'll just note, this is the product that the founder funded the foundation.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.020
It cost $3 million, plus $4,000.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.760
That will come down to $3,500.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.560
The foundation is short, and very short.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.460
It's about $3,000 per square foot.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:51.460
And the funding for the foundation that we're talking about is $3,000.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:56.660
The funding can be put together in the foundations of the fellowships, and we're happy to have a project-ended

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:02.460
portfolio where we are wanting to deliver the fees to our scholarships and our teachers and our students.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:09.460
And this is going to be our final project-ended association with the United States Army.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:19.460
We'd like to thank the members of the association for their support and their participation in the production of the

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:25.460
association to put in some good family and community support. The college has been involved

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:30.460
for the last several years and it's been a good place for the families to be nationally

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:36.460
in contact. We had a good day on October 13th through the 15th and the benefit to all of

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:41.460
them was the college. The school for recognition and recognition to the younger is growing

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.460
and we explain the number of top diversity beliefs.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.460
And the last thing is that 20 years ago,

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:55.460
there was a fund for over $600, which meant that we would add an additional $40,000

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:59.460
for the benefit of our junior city students and their communities.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:05.460
This means that we're going to add seven $1,000 scholarships to students in the fall.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:13.920
And we saw a 268 approval and a 134.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.500
Thank you.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.420
Thank you very much.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.440
And I'm on board with how we're going to do this.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:19.940
Thank you.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.560
Thank you.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.340
Thanks.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.000
Thank you.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.580
So, with that, we'll get started on the first slide,

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:30.240
so if you could please get started with your discussion.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.280
And I have a friend who said to me on the phone,

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.560
which is probably one type of immigration contract.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:45.280
So, and since June was 2014, I've been taking a leave at the University,

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.920
along with my nurse, and my child, and a couple of other state partners,

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:57.120
which I haven't talked to in a while, because I'm not too sure of whether I'm going to be staying with some of the courts,

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:06.120
to open the door and to engage with the business partners across the university to increase

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:12.120
free and international community college program. So, there has been a question to travel in

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:19.120
between but the conference has succeeded. So, that's greatly appreciated and I'm

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:23.120
so excited about the conference. So, if you have one minute to go, I'd love to get your

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.920
September. New England, Rhode Island, the State of the Islands, the State of the

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.520
African-American community, the Angel Pilgrims, and Washington, D.C. are our

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:39.120
public sector. And then the federal and the AASB chapters, Brooklyn, D.C.,

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.720
St. Jesus, Rome, the United States, the United States of America, and so forth.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.120
And also we have an opportunity to participate in the Civil War space.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:54.120
We understand that I work at a company that is going into such a difficult time to get past

00:43:54.120 --> 00:44:00.120
through, but there's some that get more than 16 or 17 schools across the country to this particular

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.120
core department. And I was a finished assessment machine, so I didn't really get to know it,

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:09.120
but some have become a little trouble. I don't know if I should say that, but I think I've been

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.120
in this for a couple of years now, and we're trying to get over some of this trouble.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:17.120
We have a team of 37 adults who get their own particular unit.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.120
We're having a new type of customer support.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.120
This practice is lots of resources that we're doing as part of this.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.120
We're going to be able to bring people out there for like the,

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.120
I just wanted to say for the next 2016,

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.120
we're going to just apologize for the experience.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.120
This is a tough scene for them.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.120
It's going to be a tough time for us.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:46.120
And then the Texas Workforce Conference. That conference is as you know a major workforce

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:52.120
work. And I like to be at the center too. And I work constantly because it's a very

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:57.120
important event. My son's team is in Texas and I'm also in the community. And we're

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:03.120
making it a great show. And I've been encouraged to be here. We've all seen this.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.980
for the equipment that we have and then you will send to yourself your list of all the

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.060
points.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.060
Thank you.

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:24.120
Mr. President, if you don't mind taking a look at the number on the screen.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.120
Okay.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:30.360
So these points are going to be on your next survey file.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:36.360
and I took this call with staff in order to get a good idea of what we were working on

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.360
and take that into account and send it to the staff.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:43.360
The core of the state of the office that we didn't have these questions for 17 hours

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:48.360
had the potential to address these areas of the police and personal safety.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:53.360
So we worked with the state of the office and other police units to get to the point

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.360
where they were able to pass the police instructions.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:00.360
And so, I think that's a really important thing that we want to look at in this first

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.360
step is how do you do that?

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.360
And, you know, we take that into account for the students and we take that into account

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.360
for the teachers.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:13.360
So, normally in teaching we have a lot of survey, mostly done in a field like that,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.360
that's the way we do it.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.360
Of course, by taking the users on survey, we do it in a way that actually shows us the

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.360
numbers of the students that are sponsored.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:30.360
This new law, which now begins, as I pointed out, to be required to use that data for raising the foreign exchange rate.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:38.360
And so, the new law passed on, it makes more of a lot of the difference as far as the flexibility of the chances of it being used at all.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.360
You may have gained billions, half a dozen, or something like that.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:52.360
But I would like to correct and make it like this, I want to understand the system, I don't believe I'm doing it to the point where I should know what is going on in the country

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:59.360
and I just want to write and I want to bring the information into the room and I want to do this, but doing it myself is not fun.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:12.360
The answer is this is another one that I think is really interesting and I would like to know if that is something I have to press the other side of the truck and so I would like to respond to that.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.760
Um, I don't know if you've worked on some of the third tier data, but maybe you've been

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.760
in the fourth tier data.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:23.860
And then you remember, in the third tier data, you would be in play, but before the

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.360
end of the third tier data, you would be in play.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.360
So you could just like, go to the third tier data, and then you would be in play.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.860
But now you're in the middle of the third tier data, and you're in play, and you're

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:36.860
in play.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:43.860
So you're actually teaching them just the main part of your style by the way.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:48.860
Or you can do an example of your style and then you can do a style that's not as much

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.860
as I said, that's just a bit more advanced.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:55.860
So if you don't feel like you're going to be able to do the same thing as you did in

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.860
the other program, I'll tell you guys that's kind of perfect.

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.860
And then you can go ahead and do the whole thing.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:09.860
So this is really the design that I'm prepared to have and we will see the results of this

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:10.860
I think about the government.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.860
And also I might be able to see the results of the elections in the next few weeks.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:20.860
So I'm very excited to see what the next board of trustees has to do with this.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:26.860
Yeah, we are looking forward to seeing what will happen in January in the board session

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:32.860
that's that's probably the only thing that's changed this year is how being able to teach that

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.860
within the media that's out there to remember what we're talking about and what we're talking about

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:45.860
with you and that's when I can try to tell you I'm going to try to see to how I should be able to

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.860
know how to communicate and to be able to listen to what I want.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.860
So, you mentioned the contact.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:49:04.860
Well, the contact, you know, we do the same in which we find each other and actually try to do the discussions

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:08.860
and we'll get together just to the first time.

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:13.860
So, you know, there's like thousands of things that we talk about and then we can't find the answers

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.360
just being ready to go.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.460
And it's something that we usually

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.740
look at in a workshop, and we're just

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:25.540
there to help guide the other workers.

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.820
So thank you, Chris.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:27.820
Anything else?

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.100
This is a very important topic.

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.600
I think we have a question for you.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.040
I think we have a question.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.000
I'm sorry.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.980
Yeah, we should get to the interview.

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.100
We have a question.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.500
We have a question from the interviewer

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.760
from the foundation.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.560
I think we have a problem, which is that we want to watch,

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.440
and I think that this broad question is on the US side,

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.560
and I think that we should be able to actually

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.800
move into a position where we can actually

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.360
have a positive impact for the EU.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.280
So just a follow-up question.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:03.200
I was thinking of somebody out on the ground.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:09.840
We had a decision now to not be able to go

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.440
So this is a combination of the two different forces.

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.440
We're going to talk about it, but it's only 500,

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.040
so maybe we can make that proportion.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.040
And then we'll go on to the next.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:25.040
We will have the next two positions on three recessions

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.040
targeting the same group.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.040
Thank you.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:33.440
I was wondering, since you're taking this on the planet,

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.440
I wanted to ask both of you,

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.640
and I think this is a requirement for each of you,

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.640
But I think it's important to mention this, some of these are strong issues.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.640
These are engaged in when we get to the new court.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:51.640
So the previous challenge is really to consider either the subject or the reason for making the court.

00:50:51.640 --> 00:51:00.640
So we have to move to the new law, to the new law, but there's no general consent to that.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.640
So, and we don't have the same interpretation.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:10.400
is the difference between the initial and the final point of the model is that it's

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.680
so safe that most people are not going to decide what to do next.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:20.640
And you know, the problem is that, you know, that petition, the way we're going to answer

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:27.200
it, we're not going to understand the convenience of that, we have to make it feasible, and

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.640
we don't have the best information to be able to answer it.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.080
So I think that's kind of the way we're going to look at it now.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.080
I think it's a pretty good point.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.080
The first thing to do is to fill in the workshop

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.080
and then try to reference the current projects

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080
that you're working on.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.080
The way I do it properly is to do it

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.080
in a very simple way.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.080
I don't know if it's really on the table

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.080
but I'm going to be applying to the

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.080
the Department of Environmental Research

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.080
and the U.S. Department of Research

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.080
to do a little bit of work on it.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.080
That's why I think it's kind of a

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.080
to remind the players of the states level of the program.

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.080
And that's the way I'm going to do it.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.080
It's actually a really simple strategy.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.080
You can look for a lot of the way you want to do it.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.080
There's three levels of that.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:15.080
The first one is the standard of the set books.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.080
We'll have to do a set of three.

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:20.080
The second one is the manual code.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.080
The third one is the experience.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.080
The fourth one is the technique.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.080
The fifth one is the math.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.080
The last one is the efficiency.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.080
And we did all the things we could do to keep the virus from being in the case.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.080
So that's what we tried to do.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.080
Because we needed more data for the virus, so that we could work on it.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:42.080
And I think that's the reason why we're so committed to this.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:47.080
And I think that we're going to do this strong and we're going to do this very, very nicely.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:51.080
So, I was going to say, I was going to say, I'm sorry, I'm going to take some of the questions.

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.080
I'm going to take some of the questions.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.080
And then I'm going to say, you know, I will eat the farm.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:53:02.080
I will say this though, we recently had a workshop, workshop that a number of people

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.080
came to try to discuss and all the communities that were trying to see the work.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:12.080
And we went through a year, two, three days out of the year, and we had the task to meet

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.080
the number of people that were trying to meet and come in.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.080
All of the groups that were involved in the project.

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:21.080
So you can say, well we're looking for a group that's interested in this, and we're

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.080
you know, you don't see them for like a few seconds or something.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.080
That's the best thing you can do.

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.080
That's the best thing you can do.

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:33.080
So, you know, I was going to say, one of the things that you need to do now in general in this course

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.080
is to tell the parents who are in the district, who are in the district,

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.080
about us, especially the public, about us.

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:43.080
I was going to say, you know, if you're thinking about us,

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:48.080
those who are in our district, you know, if you're going to use a check for us before the 15th,

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:57.080
So, I mean, I'm not going to, you know, I'm not actually going to say that I'm not going to put my own, you know,

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:04.080
like, research on a budget, because I'm not going to try to tell you that you have to be a quarter 15,

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:12.080
you know, you don't have any budget. I'm just going to come up with a policy that I can draw, you know,

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.520
I don't know anybody who has been working on this since the book was published.

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.260
So I'm looking forward to that.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.400
We're really very excited to see what happens.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.400
I'm expecting around two million people.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.400
But what can I do?

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.400
I'm so excited.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.400
It's awesome to be here.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.400
Yes.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.400
Yes.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.400
I'm sorry.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:43.400
So what we're doing is I'm drawing out a little bit of a roadmap of to decide what we're going to discuss for them.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:55:01.020
Then we certainly will also have a lot of ребur and

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:06.020
which I know everything's going to be short so I'm not going to explain the directions of today's

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:11.020
future plans. And I'm going to try and make it a little bit more short.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:14.020
So we're going to get some first-time speakers in.

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:17.020
We've met.

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:22.020
The third and second-second chairperson is on camera.

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:26.020
The second is the direct, at least, on camera.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:31.020
to develop the work list again and then we can work through the course.

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:34.020
Or, if you have a reference that you need to take to the library,

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:38.020
we can take you to the other college that we can help you with the research.

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.020
So we can work with the students.

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:43.020
Well, you know, we're going to have to work with a professional researcher,

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.020
so we're going to have to work with a professional researcher.

00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:49.020
I just realized I have a little bit of time left.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.020
Okay.

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:58.100
Okay. And then, you know, I want to point out one thing, which is, I think this is not

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:03.380
a connective thing. You want to, I don't know, move on and think that that, as you can see

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:07.540
there, you press right and you're writing on this journal. So, I'm concerned that the

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:12.020
material will be left behind and for that reason, I actually moved into this into a

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:18.180
little bit of an extra detail. So, I think just being able to kind of update things

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.180
Okay. We only just know that already.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.060
It is because of the connection rod.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.060
I assume she's sorry.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:23.540
Yeah.

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.540
Yeah.

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.920
So because we did require that lock and lock,

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.960
but with the XP running on,

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:39.080
we're only going to use the

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:42.280
as just before.

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.280
and then several more point trials, and then,

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.280
I think, Friday we can pass the session with additional minutes.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.280
We were told to evaluate it, and then fix the reports,

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:56.280
and then just go and fix it from the top of our board

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.280
and then we'll see how we can put the reports down on us.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:02.280
And then we'll pay you up before the end of the year

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.280
and listen to the transfer and general counsel

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.280
and then we'll do the work through.

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.280
Again, we have to offer that to the people,

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.280
We hope you enjoyed this video and we hope you share it with your friends.

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:16.280
