00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.620
you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.620
you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Hello, I'm David, and I'm the director of the Center for the Arts at the University of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Chicago.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm going to talk about the importance of the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now, these are the only examples of how we've made it possible, how we've made it possible to have these programs for thousands,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you can say, not just one of our own, but a bunch of other programs that we've done.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I thought about it before I mentioned this. Companies can publish papers, they don't need to publish that first book,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
if they are about to begin moving into the public and the public will be a place for

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
a person to be able to engage in the building.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
This is actually a very short video clip.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm talking about the city of Green, and we're going to be chatting over here.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And we're going to be talking about the building of Green.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And we're going to be talking about the building of Green.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And we're going to be talking about the building of Green.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Okay, sorry.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.120
You just followed me this morning and then went to the office, right?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.600
I am going to the office of the president of the United States, and I am going to be

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.740
meeting with the president, on Monday, September 10th.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.740
Okay.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.140
So, you know, we're going to be meeting with you.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.140
Okay.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.620
But first of all, thank you very much for getting into this point.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.620
Thank you.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.620
Thank you very much.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.620
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.660
I do want to say thank you to all of you who participated in this session.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.460
Any questions or comments about the most important thing?

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.360
I want to say thank you to all of you for coming in today.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.120
I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak to you and all of you as you were asked

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.680
to keep your statements to the end of the talk.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.160
You have no time for the questions with the Board.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.660
We definitely want to make sure that we let your comments come.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.720
just, you know, water bowls, machines, everything.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.980
And then we have a lot of other things underneath, and I already brought some of the other questions

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.980
in, too.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.980
Okay.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.980
Thank you.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.980
Okay, thanks, guys.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.980
Okay.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.980
All right, we're back.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.980
Well, we've got three more.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.980
We've got a little bit of a look at the one from our library.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.980
Well, first, I'd like to give a little bit of an overview on what we've got here.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.980
We've got a lot of battery, and we have an enormous amount of power.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.980
And then we have a lot of power, and you'll get the idea, we have a lot of power in here,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.340
We had a lot of doctors in the backseat

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.500
in the store that sold food for the food.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.860
And I spent that time thinking, hey,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.700
this is something that the boys and girls are

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.080
trying to do in this next state.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.700
But what if they're not going to do it?

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.200
And they're not going to do it.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.740
That's the problem with everything that we do.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.860
We're not going to do it.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.940
We're not going to do it.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.980
We're not going to do it.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.860
And we didn't have a program for all the way

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.860
And then we have the power sector.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.860
And that's a major role in the government,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.860
but it's also an opportunity for us to get into the core.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.860
We're going to do it in the next couple of years.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.860
Well, that's a good point.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.860
That's a good point.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.860
I have to admit, I'm a large fan of the story

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.860
of the military man in the military connection.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.860
He's been captured and buried for a long time.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.860
He's been buried for a long time.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.860
I'm going to try and be nervous when I finish my paper.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.860
It's your turn, you go.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.860
This is my first time doing this.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.860
I'm a little shy.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.860
Sorry.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.860
Okay.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.860
I'm going to just go ahead and look at these two days.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.860
For the rest of this meeting, we're going to have 45 seconds of recording and discussion.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.460
The U.S. National Institute of Education is a national department of law, which indicates that public sector,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.420
social media, leadership, and local and state government is one part of education.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.900
With the nations' architecture and the U.S. people's climate, she has served as a national advocate for the

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:41.260
University of Wisconsin-Houston and as senior public health manager for the State Department of Development and Public Safety.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.260
We've been receiving updates that the University of Ohio Education has a

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
representative work in Seattle, Washington.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.260
This representative work was a national project that met a new and

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
innovative purpose.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
It is more than just a national library.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
It's also a state-owned university.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Not perfect.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Not perfect.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.260
I'm not sure.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.260
I'm not sure.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.260
I'm not sure.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.260
I'm not sure.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I'm not sure.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.260
I'm not sure.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and we're just great to hear.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.760
Thank you.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.260
Thank you.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.760
Thank you.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
I'd like to thank everyone for staying up late

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.260
for this time.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
We're going to have some really nice and peaceful

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and expert state and federal officers following you

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
along with some continued social distancing.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Thank you.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And Dr. Ramos will come forward with a story

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.260
of the month.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:51.260
Okay, so we're going to start with one.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And that's number one, that there are no documents when they are including those students.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:10.260
in 1941 and that was introduced later. So we are at 800-112. The number one date that

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:16.260
we were going to be in Southwark in the week ahead of our July 3rd, I think our date was

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:24.260
June 17th, and that was probably the most official date for our panel.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:33.260
And I took my role with 1,357, and that is 32 million.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And I'm a school board member, and I'm a school is going to be the first.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:45.260
And when it compares to average age for a school in the 1,022, we're at 567.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:53.260
And the reason why we're at 567 is because we were getting these questions from one person before the other.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.260
So, if you're going to write a book or you're doing something through other sources,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.260
I think you're going to have to write a book that's really clear and really clear to the audience.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Are there any other questions?

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.260
No.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Alright.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.260
So, I'm going to go ahead and ask you to do the same thing, and then I'll go ahead and finish.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
I'll just finish the first two.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.260
Okay.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And we have a three minute break.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Yeah.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Alright.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Thank you.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.060
to do a lot of work on that.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.580
But I don't know.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.020
I don't know if you're familiar with that.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.580
But they do a lot of work on that.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.580
It's super difficult.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.059
And it's a lot of work.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.980
But you're telling me that you can

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.480
imagine if you break the law.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.240
I can't.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.820
Yes, I think you can.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.260
I don't know if you can.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.980
No, no, I can't.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.179
I don't know if they can.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:45.740
I always have questions.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.300
I still have a question.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.620
I think you can go on.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.060
and it's very exciting to think about.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.420
Okay, and just one more.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.720
I don't know if you can hear me.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.300
You have to be back there.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.400
Okay.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.260
I don't know if you can hear me,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.360
but I think we'll start right here.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.560
I think we'll start right here.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.000
I thought you were okay.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.400
Well, I'm sure I'm still going to have to

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.500
have to have a little bit of a hard time.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.600
I think I'm going to have to

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.280
show you guys the paper, so.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.140
But why are you going to show me the paper?

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.680
Just because.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.720
Don't you have to show the board

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:25.520
and the impact that each course would be in the way that we're structuring to services

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.720
as well as instruction. But not only are we going to do it in statewide and national work,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.120
but in your communities. We've got the faculty and things like that that are going to be

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.720
really helpful for students to just play around and if you're in kind of campus and utilize

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.120
that to take a vision for the future. Thank you.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:52.120
What if you wanted to get the data from the audience and then you want to put it in the

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.120
zone and actually give a practice of learning to get data?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:03.120
What happens when you do that if the levels are lower than we expected or how do you reach

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.120
out to the data for it?

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.120
Do you make sure that you keep the learning in check?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:23.960
I'm going to do a little bit of a

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.400
Thank you.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:26.960
Thank you.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.640
Thank you.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.300
Thank you for this presentation.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.000
Thank you.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.780
Thank you.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.100
I'm going to go to the back, right?

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:35.600
OK.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.100
OK.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.220
I'm just going to go back in mind

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.520
and to those pages, which are the pages in the book,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.300
I've done so many things.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.240
And I was just talking, really, really good at writing

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.060
that.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.300
I was having lunch, and I was in Banish,

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.300
and I was just traveling in the morning,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.940
and I just kind of came out to the next room

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.780
I think we've kind of seen this.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.700
Not kidding.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.860
We didn't see it.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.980
We didn't see that.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.360
So, remember that the boundary and the boundary

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.880
are the future modes.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.840
It's being used for that.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.800
Now, you've got to understand what the future modes are.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.140
So, if you're doing the whole of the chip,

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.300
you have to know what's the most important.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.300
So, it's important.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.460
But then, these are the normal curves

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.460
So, we're going to start with our first one, which is the movement by the bone.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.460
And we're going to start by giving a look at the screen, whether we can get it back on the block,

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.460
and whether we can have it rotate, and it's going to work. That's the first step.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.460
And then we're going to start with the bone.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.460
We're going to start with one way, and we're going to do it with one key.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.460
And we're going to take our eight-inch block, which we're going to start by making,

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.460
and then we're going to add a border.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.320
So that's the next step.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.820
But yeah, we just want to make sure that we have a system in order to break that

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.620
in between points.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.320
And we don't want to build a problem for each other.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.180
We can work on that.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.360
I just want to make sure that we have a bridge.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.920
We're going to have to do that.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.320
We're going to have to do the revolution.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.820
Exactly.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.320
Yeah.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.820
Yeah.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.320
Yeah.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:06.820
Yeah.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.320
Yeah.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.820
Yeah.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.320
That's the point.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:08.820
That's the point.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.320
Yeah.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:09.820
Yeah.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.320
That's the point.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:10.820
Yeah.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.320
Yeah.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.820
Yeah.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.320
Yeah.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:12.820
Yeah.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.320
Yeah.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:13.820
Yeah.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.860
Scott?

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.320
I got one letter to add.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.380
That was the one I wanted to add.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:21.980
Yeah.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.120
And Scott if you have a question,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.580
just call me and we'll do it.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.760
Two letters, right?

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.820
Yeah, two letters.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.920
I'll just do it twice.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.380
Okay.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.320
Brian, can you share something with us?

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.080
Yeah, sure.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.120
So we have three parts of a community

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.620
and how we're going to apply it.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:48.620
What kind of knowledge base would you think would be able to show us that the family has

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.620
that experience?

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:56.620
I'm sure we didn't get that out until we were able to actually go and reflect as well as

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.620
the students and the people that we were able to meet.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.620
Yeah.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.620
Okay.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.620
Thank you.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:09.620
This piece for the child on the right, children on the left, I think it was amazing to see

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.620
the new shape of it.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.600
I mean, it's incredible.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.580
actually from going through the 36th floor,

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.020
essentially, of the lab for the tumor.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.020
So that's what we're doing.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.940
We're going back and taking the half and two

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.420
of the top of the lab.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.700
So that's how it works.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.500
And that's how you create a tumor there.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.500
And what do you think the amount of tumor

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.540
is going to be?

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.200
We're going to have to do more and more.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.700
So we're going to have to do more and more.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.540
I don't know.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.340
I don't know right now.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.200
I don't know what's going on with the records.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.360
I don't know if you know anything about that.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.560
But there was certainly a lot of people

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:51.240
that thought that there was just a lot of things.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.280
So that's the way it is.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.780
I'm sorry.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.280
I'm sorry.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:54.780
I'm sorry.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.280
I'm sorry.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:55.780
I'm sorry.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.280
I'm sorry.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:56.780
I'm sorry.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:57.280
I'm sorry.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:57.780
I'm sorry.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.360
I'm sorry.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.860
I'm sorry.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.360
I'm sorry.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.200
So we had a 1.5, 7.1.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.660
And then she's entitled to the first book of the English

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.080
and the other book of the English.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.580
And she has a book called The Time.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.880
That's what I'm going to say in the book.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.480
It's a really good book.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.280
I'm looking forward to seeing the book.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.360
I'm looking forward to hearing it.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360
It was really good.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.160
It's a really good book.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.500
It was a great book.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.080
It's like a personal book.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.780
It's a really good book.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.480
It's a really good book.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.780
And it's educational.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.280
It's great.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.300
All the books are in it.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:39.600
And then, I'm going to give a little bit of a brief about the features that we're storing

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600
in these.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.600
We're going to put this back.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.600
And then, basically, we're going to put our, just put it on the ground, very much into

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.600
the ground.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.600
We're going to put it into a very little corner.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.600
We're going to start using the grids.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.160
They're the dead-side system.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.000
With that kind of isolation, there's

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.240
no point in doing anything.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.980
And that did complete the E3, 1 and 2.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.440
And I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys have to say.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.900
We're going to have a discussion about the E3.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.540
That'll be good.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.260
We're going to have a discussion about the E3.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.680
And I want to say thank you, everyone, for your participation.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.680
Yeah.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.680
So, it's not that I don't even know what it stands for, it's just that, I kind of

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:37.680
said, so, like, if you can do this for me, I will, I'll do it for you, I will take

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680
that as well.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.680
I already told you about this, so, um, you know, just to show you that, it's hard to

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.680
tell you about it because it's not, it's not something that we've talked about.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.680
So, he's really nice.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.560
Thank you.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.660
And we'll talk.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.700
How do you like that?

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.240
I think it's a very important topic.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.100
We've had some discussions.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.040
We've had some meetings.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.580
We've had a lot of conversations.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.520
We've had a lot of conversations.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.460
We've had a lot of meetings.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.140
And I think we've had a lot of questions.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.480
And we've had a lot of conversations.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.640
We haven't had a great time.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.320
And I think we've had a lot of conversations.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.260
All right, sir.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.860
Thank you.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.140
Thank you very much.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.640
Thank you.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.640
And then lastly, I'm going to go to the same record,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.640
that I recorded in the show, and I performed it

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.640
on the ground in the basement.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.640
And that's the one that I was in the room with.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.640
It was a family of three, and they were in the room

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.640
with their two children.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.640
They were actually the ones with the children.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.640
And they were discussing what they were expecting.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.640
And I could reach them into the room,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.640
and they would just stand there,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.640
and they couldn't do anything,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.640
they just were with the children.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:51.140
and that we value more on us than the amount of protection that we're going to take.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.140
And this is a shift that we're going to make.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.640
So that number is better.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.640
And our value is better now that we've shown the value of that number on the map.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.640
Thank you.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.640
Thank you.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.640
We have a question just coming in.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:16.640
So you know maybe take a radio and a radio and reverse the light for a 30 minutes after

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.640
40 minutes after having a new one.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.640
So actually we've got most of the children like that still live on site.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.640
So I guess by now we know just what we do not like.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.640
So the time we like to take them, or if we don't have them, we'll kind of allow them

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.640
to stay in the room.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.640
really really far from what we can get here. We can get it to the

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.640
end of the year. So that's the way it is.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.640
Thank you very much.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.640
Thank you very much, John.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.640
And I would like to give you the floor.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.640
Thank you very much.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.640
Thank you very much.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.640
Thank you very much.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.640
Thank you very much.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.640
I was just wondering if you were going to say something about

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.640
the production of funding and the single-home expansion,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:08.640
And I thought you noticed in the topic you never revised going in about race and policy.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.640
Which is a very important question.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.640
About the time of the season, specifically when you're in the springtime,

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.640
so it says, when we're all in the season, it's not because of the climate change,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.640
it's because we can't really make our way back to the country that we're in.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:29.640
And it means that we're not going to have to have a season in the different countries we're supposed to be in.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:36.440
And, um, kind of fairly early on, but, so, so I didn't, you know, for the students, you know,

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.640
I've talked to people who've had experience like, you know, in terms of certain projects,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.940
um, trying to use the faculty members and so when the state level, or when the state

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:51.740
could consider moving into a, um, like, a, you know, a similar setting, that would be,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.640
you know, um, an early change, it's a long time, but you know, it's, there's, there's

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.640
in the other side of the street in the other section,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.640
are the only ones in the situation

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.640
who are misconditioned and are considered to participate

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.640
by partisan parties who have no authority

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.640
and find that and have full control

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.640
of the voting system in the world.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.640
So it's not, it doesn't feel as time-consuming

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.640
and confusing as the work we're doing

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.640
at the time of early support

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.640
when we are conducting the vote

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.640
in the right conditions.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.640
I would say, and we've been talking about this

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.640
with our work here, that that last point

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.640
is absolutely absolutely important

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.640
That's not what they use in foreign media.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.640
They use basically the same as what you saw.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.640
I think that is very good because you're in a world where you're talking with different

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.640
people.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:42.640
So, um, they use the same kind of media as well and that's what they use in foreign media.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:49.640
The other thing we're doing is, um, it was actually before the...

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.640
I'm sorry.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:57.640
But then the other place to present the cost of the rotation is the first one we know from

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.640
the back, which is the board position that was revealed at the beginning.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.640
This was actually true.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.640
I think, I think Mark was going to say that the first one was the one that was revealed

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.640
to the board, which is the one that was revealed to the board.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.640
But before we go into some more of that confusion, is there ever a condition in which a project

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.080
exactly when the treatment positions are in order, which the director himself will tell

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.580
you how to do it, and it is already in the contract and it is already in the special

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:29.780
facility. So thank you very much for your questions and it takes about one minute and

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.320
a half to get through. Thank you.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.580
Thank you very much.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.520
Thank you very much.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.280
Thank you.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:34.780
Thank you.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.280
Thank you.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:35.780
Thank you.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.280
Thank you.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:36.780
Thank you.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.280
Thank you.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.780
Thank you.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:43.000
I think we're starting to find one way with the other, particularly, so I think that's

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.500
I'm sorry.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.000
I'm sorry.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.500
I'm sorry.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.240
I want to point out that we saw a financial disturbance

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:49.740
before.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.240
We were looking at five dollars that were in.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.540
And at this time, you had talked about that.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.500
That was a new initial competition

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.920
for the United Nations, that the private sector

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.240
is filing that financial disturbance.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.080
This one is a new one.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:14.780
And that's my question is, is there a way to help?

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.280
Is there a way to prevent it from being so distributed

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.200
that it's not worth the bandwidth or anything?

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.180
Actually, there's more research going on.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.420
It's both really more focused on numbers and the scale

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.460
of it, but it's more to remember that it's

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.660
more similar to learning.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.540
That's the only one for state and local state.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.800
Which is what programs are more effective because they

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.040
help you with the changing of scholarship.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.040
But the second point, and the next point is that,

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.040
I think we generally don't decide on information

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.040
when it's in full or in full application.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.040
And there's always an issue with word outs of certain words.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.040
So what we've seen from that point is that we've been

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.040
seeing things that were completely different

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.040
and they're potentially more profound

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.040
and more questions can be answered in terms of

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.040
how our students are learning and how we respond to those.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:12.040
We want to have a good office, and there's no statue for our platform.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:18.040
We have a policy in which we need to have a holistic forum, and doing that should help

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.040
improve our relationship with the future.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:26.040
And, you know, for the time being, that's one of the things we really want to do.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.040
And we are going to put the website up for you to be able to go over with it.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.040
So, I think that's definitely where we need to go.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.040
I have a question. I have a question.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.040
My question is a little complicated.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:45.040
So this is the state where the governor of Seattle was born.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.040
And this is the state that's called Seattle.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.040
So you can do what you want with the state as a whole.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:58.040
And in a sense, this is a state that I mean,

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.040
you want to show that the Council can make sure that the

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.040
other committee will try to acquire the Council committee

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.040
for the new meetings.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.040
Thank you, Chris.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.040
I can put that in there, but the only thing I want to

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.040
talk to the committee is the hiring part.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.040
You know, it's something that we have to do.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.040
But to make it, if we actually can't do this,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.040
so we have only nine meetings per year,

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.040
and the company needs to pay a little more for its contracts,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.040
we don't have to be the first one to be driving that

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.760
that they might have abstained from the government.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.260
Exactly.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.340
This is the bail party.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:29.840
Yeah.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.280
It's the bail party.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.800
So what is going on in the European Union?

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.100
Well, the government is fighting itself.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.040
And it's telling us that we have an idea that if we actually

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.500
go to the White House, that we need to come out

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.540
and deliver these notes to the government.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.040
Right.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.040
And everyone is going to have to stay out of the war

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.800
with government.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.460
It's like the war against government is really

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.540
in the hands of the government, or the government's

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.840
not taking it.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.080
I'm not sure if I'm right.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.940
No, you're not.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.420
I mean, it's not a one-numbered, only two-numbered contract.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.340
So I think it might be one-numbered,

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.980
but it's not a one-numbered contract

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.620
till you leave that alone.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.120
And it's, you know, I think it's a good way to say it.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.520
And I'm not sure you want to speak to that.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.060
I think we're reaching a good result.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.940
We're not very much in the middle of it.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.740
Yeah.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.940
I think we're almost there.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.700
I'm not sure if that's the right term for competition.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.300
I'm not sure.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.180
Yeah, that's kind of cool.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.300
Now, you know, if you're a leader in the club,

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.100
however many years you've been here,

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.340
you're so well-versed in the club.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.080
You're a leader in the club.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.340
So you're a leader in the club.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.320
And basically, you're the leader of the club.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.020
In fact, I was the leader of the club.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.940
So you're the leader of the competition.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.860
So I'm not a leader.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.980
So it's not a bad thing to be successful at all.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:55.980
And so that process set up the rules for the South American Health District Act to just

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.980
navigate through the gathering and the public health service.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:04.980
I'd like to say that the Citizens' Independence Conference is actually a district-wide panel

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.980
for member-reviewed facilities, and we are in the working process.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.980
And some of the planning is kind of the same as the opposition in the development, which

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.660
I'm sorry that's just a side note,

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.880
touch on the television and the video,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.700
we just have that process over here,

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.000
for the whole time too.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.520
Thank you.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.560
Yeah, thank you very much.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.220
Thank you very much, and I appreciate it.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:25.720
Thank you.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.920
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.660
And we've been speaking at many, many lectures

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.860
from all over the country, and I'm

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.420
so glad you brought us here.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.080
You're welcome.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.000
Thank you very much.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.060
You're the number one, and I think

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.040
very much, and I think the whole question

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.020
of the major program measures, which

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:49.020
and we have a few discussions and conversations that are going on in the world.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.020
Yeah.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.020
All right.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.020
Well, there's a next question.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:56.020
I'm from the University of California, and I'm a student.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.020
I'm wondering if you have any questions.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.020
I have a question for you.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.020
I'm just curious about your experience.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.020
What is your home city area?

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.020
And where should that influence?

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:10.020
Today's report has presented to you some of the things that you may have noticed, especially

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:15.020
the most unique thing that came to the view of the challenge of the three-step treatment.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:21.020
The problems that you've been confronted with are whether you're more on the right or how

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.020
hard it is to get the treatment performed.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.020
Is your disorder changed?

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:31.020
I think most of the time the changes are more in the early stages, so you don't have to

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:36.300
to the printing, but in the sense that it would be a record video we're doing it today,

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.820
I would recommend it more.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:42.220
Because it was part of the report, we didn't want to make it a part of a particular report

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.020
for the training.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.620
So we wanted to have the people that were making the records, so thank you.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.580
Thank you.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.020
Great meeting you all.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.380
Thank you very much.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:52.940
Thank you.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.580
Thank you.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.140
Thank you.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:54.780
Thank you.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.340
Thank you.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:55.900
Thank you.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.460
Thank you.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.100
Thank you.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:57.660
Thank you.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.220
Thank you.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:58.780
Thank you.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:59.340
Thank you.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:26:59.900
Thank you.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:00.460
Thank you.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.100
I think that's a good question.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.220
I found it on the list.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.180
I can't tell you.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:04.680
Mr. Martin.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.700
Thank you.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.200
Thank you.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.700
Thank you.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.200
Thank you.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.700
Thank you.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.200
Thank you.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:08.700
Thank you.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.780
I'll turn to the next question.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.760
One of them is, as you were speaking to Joe Brown,

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.240
which is a different platform from the one

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.700
that you mentioned earlier.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.500
It's a very different concept.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.220
It's about institutionalization of learning

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.960
in terms of how to navigate data.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.800
Do you want to comment on that?

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.400
So we're still looking for more and more people.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.240
So I think we're ready for any more questions.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.580
Does your mind still feel empty?

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.080
I'm sorry?

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.580
I'm sorry.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.160
I think I'm fine.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:39.660
Yeah.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.340
Oh, I don't know why she's still there.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.080
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.560
It's fine.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.060
I'm fine.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:44.900
Actually, I think I'm fine.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.400
I'm fine.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.560
I don't know how it's going to be,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.560
but I'm just saying, could be.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.520
Oh, yeah.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.420
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.880
I think we're going.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.640
I think we're going.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.140
I'm sorry.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.960
The question is, I have to know that your chair has

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.540
stayed in country power.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:03.780
and we're also doing a lot of work on sending that out to all the clients that contact us based on their marketing.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:09.540
And we're also doing a huge workshop this weekend for the regional report in January 2023.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.860
We have a location right here in January 2024.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:18.940
And we're also having a talk with Lori on the election day, the first thing in the year, which was in August, I believe.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.940
Thank you.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.940
Thank you so much.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.940
Thank you.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.940
Thank you.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.940
Thank you.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:25.940
Thank you.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:26.940
Thank you.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:27.940
Thank you.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:35.940
We have this case, and we've done this, you said, one year, graph right before this.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.940
We have this one year.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.940
Right.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:49.940
And my question is, can we start thinking, we've done all the work that you mentioned,

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:58.280
can you roll for the future? Is this the, is this the new idea or is the new idea starting

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.180
up to keep coming forward?

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:05.060
Okay. So I think it's a good question. We're in the week we can go back and make

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.940
the move. I think that would be the number one thought because changes can be more or

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:15.100
less result in the average exercise. So we have to be on time. That's what we're going

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.980
So we did come up with a lot of that for our students.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.500
And we found out that there were women

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.860
taking the course for our students.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.020
And then we had a little bit of an addition

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.060
but not very much of a mention.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.360
We had a workshop that I wanted to come up with.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.680
Where did we go from there?

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.300
Is there any other questions?

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:37.780
I guess that's all we have here is the textbook.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.820
The particular presentation that we decided

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.420
was going to be a really, really extraordinary campaign

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.540
that they've gotten out.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.700
So it's not a lot of much information

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.820
that we have right now, if I'm being honest.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.000
So we're going to have a lot of people

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.300
who are going to get up to the stage

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.080
where they're going to be able to get questions

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.360
to talk to their own audience.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.620
Yeah, that's great.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.320
And I want to say, Gordon, I just

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.480
want to say that we've been talking

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.080
for 10 years before this.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.060
And we've gotten a lot of people to watch out for this video.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.740
Thank you for doing all this.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.420
We will work with you next December

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.020
and there are areas that we have an uproar in the military population as well.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:20.780
And I'm disappointed in the way we're putting it together and presenting it to our particular

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.780
libraries and our other libraries.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.180
We have a way that is not a rapid change in our control of the prior science,

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.180
and then when we're looking to look at that summit, we're going to be saying yes

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.180
and making point that's going to happen and taking care of the study.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.180
and then you've got to move down the road and care for the kids.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.180
So that's the thing.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.180
So I think it's a difficult time for the kids,

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.180
whether it's professional or the kids.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.180
I think it's a difficult time for the kids.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.180
I have a question.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.180
I could maybe answer one of them.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:57.180
I think this is going a little bit to study on the body.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.180
So I'm just going to take a question from the public.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.180
I think it's a good question.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.180
different ways of doing it, trying to go elsewhere.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.840
And then the next question, and we have a comment here

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.640
with a recent issue of Professor LeMahieu's association.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.240
Thank you.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.580
Thank you, Professor LeMahieu.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.500
So are there any questions?

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.120
I would like to ask a couple of questions.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.500
I do think that some of the things that we talked about

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.020
today, the spiritual world, right,

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.960
Well, you know, it's a different thing.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.460
We've got this, but we can think of it

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.300
as a new kind of a project, which is very cool.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.060
So that's what we're doing.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.060
OK.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.980
That was my question to you, George.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.740
And then I'm going to ask you a question.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.480
So you mentioned that the research

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.280
is on the state of the earth.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.420
I don't know if it's on the world.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.620
They don't say.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.580
Well, those are not.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.140
I don't know if they're doing it.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.160
They're doing it.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.060
I'm sorry.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:51.560
I'm sorry.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.060
I'm sorry.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.560
I'm sorry.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.060
I'm sorry.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:32:01.620
the right hander to check the next half. So I'm going to go into the module like I came

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:09.540
down for before and then do the final of that next week about some of the classes, what

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:15.860
we're going to do, what we're going to do, how we, I think we need to do a lot of the

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.620
same things here and that's what I'm going to do.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.620
So, I think that's pretty good.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.620
Yeah, I agree.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.620
And I think that we're still waiting on the potential for the

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.620
transformation of the platform.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.620
I mean, I'm not sure about the role of the platform, but I think

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.620
it's basically a key example.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.620
Yeah.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:38.620
So, what about in terms of the platforms?

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.620
Okay, so, you can kind of, if I may, you can imagine, what about

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.620
the original platform?

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.620
What's the current value version of this platform?

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.620
that's a good thing.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.620
That's a good thing.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.620
That's a good thing.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.620
That's a good thing.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:55.620
And we're all going to be able to come out to our own side of the table and share our

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.620
opportunities.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.620
It's really important to be able to collaborate.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:06.620
So, just to add, we have a sense of drag from the political and the innovation to the

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.620
digital and the innovation to the mobilization.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.620
So, I'm going to take questions from you.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.620
How does he perform?

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.620
How does he perform?

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.620
I will tell you a story about him, actually.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.620
It was a very interesting story.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.620
He was a very good student.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.620
He was very good.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.620
He was very, very good.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.620
He was very, very good.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.620
I think he was really good at math.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.620
I think he was really good at math.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.620
I have another question.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.620
Did you have a transfer student?

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.620
Yes.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.620
Did you have a transfer student?

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.620
You have to have a lot of things in order to do that.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.620
You have to start with the basic things.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.620
It's not an easy task.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.620
So, I'm going to call it.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.620
Well, I think that's it.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.620
I think you have a good job.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.620
I'm going to call it.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.620
I'm going to take the next step.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.620
You know, I've got a problem with the

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.620
power of knowledge and well-being

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.620
and I think that's something that

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.620
I've learned a lot of in the past.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.620
I think we're going to have

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.580
I'm not sure if I'm right.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.820
I mean, the transfer of the powers,

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.280
but we're not sure how far we're going.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.480
I'm trying to figure out where we're going.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.860
I don't know if you can.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.820
I'm trying to figure out where we're going.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.380
I'm trying to figure out where we're going.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.219
I'm trying to figure out where we're going.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:34.480
I think maybe these guys are out of touch.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.679
It's very much a matter of their ability

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.659
to be able to move the fraction of the area.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.880
And that's the area where we're going to have to do this.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.360
And that's the area where we're going to move the fraction.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.120
I think she's going to be the next person to move that.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.040
So we've got two of them.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.420
But if we have any more questions,

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.520
we'll get back to you.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.020
Thank you.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.800
Yes.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.900
I thought I'd talk about the question

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.900
So, we're going to give you a tip on the ground and the airway.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.900
And then, we're going to have some little special meetings.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:14.900
So, this is going to be a succession of different webinars about what the mechanics of the airway

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.900
and the mechanics of the airway are.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.900
And then, we're going to have a talk about the effects of moving that power.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.900
And then, we're going to see if we're going to move it around the base for the first time.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.900
Thank you.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.060
So that's going to be a board of action.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.560
All right.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.700
I think this is going to be a lot of trouble.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.800
We're running out of time.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.720
We're running out of time.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.880
We're running out of time.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.440
We're running out of time.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.280
We're running out of time.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:49.920
I'm sorry.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.800
I was trying to get the chance to follow up

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.400
and close to the board and see it.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.940
Sometimes we're out in a room playing,

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.800
and our police keep them on screen.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.040
We're going to campus work and see if campus

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:13.740
seems to be doing as well as I know it probably will be playing

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.800
when I'm out to get a big award.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.040
And again, I know this will be a little bit of a different

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.560
session, but I'd like to let you know

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.720
our relatives and our protocols for reducing situations off campus. And now that we are

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:36.800
going to have people on campus, we're going to try to understand that these are our claims

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.220
and our complaints about what we're doing here.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.220
Thank you.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.220
We have a question.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:49.720
I think about the fact that when I see the progress that one guy in the team did not

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.720
have a good report that gave him nothing, and I was impressed by the way that he had

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.720
props on him, which is something that happened.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.720
It's really important, really important when we're here.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.720
Thank you.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.720
I'm going to read the first question, and then I'm going to ask you a question.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.720
the largest location in the world, 6.3 million square feet.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.720
That's cool.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.720
That's a lot of space.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.720
Yeah.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.720
And then the one chart we saw, it was at one piece of the

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.720
ground, the one that's like 6.2 million square feet,

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.720
and it was a very strong, very, very, very, very strong

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720
ground.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.720
And now we're going forward to exactly 6.3 million square

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720
feet.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.720
And so, we're on target.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.720
And that's what we're looking for.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:41.040
And it's really important to know that, not only to understand, but also to understand more about these

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.040
and then actually share with us what kind of information we have to do.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.960
And I think it's really important to know that we can definitely share this information,

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.080
but at least 2% of the time we want to do a technical study.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.640
So, we can help out a little bit and do a good job.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:01.520
Yeah, so there's a lot around of technical data, and we should be in fact on all of these levels here.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.320
Of course, you know, that.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.320
Thank you.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:33.940
you

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:03.940
you

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:33.940
you

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:03.940
you

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:33.940
you

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:03.940
you

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:33.940
you

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:03.940
you

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:33.940
you

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.940
you

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:33.940
you

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:03.940
you

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:33.940
you

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:03.940
you

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:33.940
you

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:03.940
you

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:33.940
you

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:03.940
you

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:33.940
you

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:03.940
you

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:33.940
you

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:03.940
you

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:33.940
you

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:03.940
you

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:33.940
you

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:03.940
you

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:33.940
you

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:03.940
you

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:33.940
you

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:03.940
you

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:33.940
you

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:03.940
you

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:33.940
you

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:03.940
you

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:33.940
you

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:03.940
you

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:33.940
you

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:03.940
you

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:33.940
you

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:03.940
you

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:33.940
you

00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:03.940
you

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:33.940
you

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:03.940
you

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:33.940
you

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:03.940
you

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:33.940
you

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:03.940
you

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:33.940
you

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:03.940
you

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:33.940
you

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:03.940
you

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:33.940
you

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:03.940
you

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:33.940
you

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:03.940
you

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:33.940
you

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:03.940
you

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:33.940
you

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:03.940
you

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:33.939
you

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:03.939
you

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:33.939
you

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:03.940
you

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:33.940
you

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:03.940
you

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:33.940
you

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:03.940
you

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:33.940
you

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:03.940
you

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:33.940
you

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:03.940
you

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:33.940
you

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:03.940
you

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:33.940
you

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:03.940
you

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:33.940
you

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:03.940
you

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:33.940
you

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:03.940
you

01:18:33.320 --> 01:19:03.300
Thank you.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.320
Amen.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.320
on the next page and I'm just going to check that out.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.320
We're going to have to test it and get the assessment.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:44.320
We're going to go to the next page and before Ian sets the door again,

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320
I will remain in the area by the wayside.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.320
We're just going to go to the back for the test,

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.320
and then after we look at the data, we'll get to you.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.320
Is this turning?

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.320
It's turning.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.320
It's turning.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320
Okay.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.320
We hope for a new year release.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.320
We're seeing the copy of our sign,

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.320
but we're not going to see anything in the next year.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:07.320
the other one I put in because we'd be curious to do it with some lower-priced

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.320
food or off-priced food.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.320
Well, today is our first winter summer.

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.320
We have a cool snow.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.320
It's starting to get a little more cold in the morning.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.320
It's getting a little warmer.

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.320
It's getting a little bit colder.
