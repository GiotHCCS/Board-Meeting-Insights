00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.620
you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.620
you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Hello, I'm David, and I'm the director of the Center for the Arts at the University of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Chicago.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm going to talk about the importance of the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now, these are the only examples of how we've made it possible, how we've made it possible to have these programs for thousands,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you can say, not just one of our own, but a bunch of other programs that we've done.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I thought about it before I mentioned this. Companies can publish papers, they don't need to publish that first book,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.680
If they are about to be in the middle of a battle,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.960
he has to tackle them with a large sword

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.880
and put them into the hands of the king in the middle.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.280
This is actually just an example of a really nice fight.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.720
And so we're going to move to the ring.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.000
And we're going to attack that area.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.800
And here's the guy who's going to attack us.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800
And we're going to attack him in the middle.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.200
And then we're going to really take him to the edge there.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.080
This ball is going to be a ball that's going to be a ball.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.380
And then you're going to have to have

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.520
a lot of these many areas where you're going to have

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.700
a lot of these.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.580
So you have to have a lot of these.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.540
And then you have to have a lot of these.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.880
And then you have to have a lot of these.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.580
The ball will match a lot.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.920
And it's going to be more of a G in 2024,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.240
which I like to think.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.560
Maybe in the future.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.060
I think we're going to be doing a second.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.200
We're going to be doing a second.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.600
And the actions and the comments

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.060
will not have most of the power.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.740
We're going to have all the time.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.320
So we're going to have all the time for everybody

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.120
to speak in order to put a feeling of power

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.800
into what you ask and keep your statements to that point.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.200
You have not to have a conversation with the board.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.460
If you get to a point where you want to,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.720
you can just say that point you want to.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.160
There's no question.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.900
It's just in order to move forward.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.400
And then we have a lot of other things.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.500
I don't know if you know, but I'm going to go over

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.180
the questions that I'm going to share with you.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.180
Can we do some questions?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.680
Thank you.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.180
Thank you.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.680
Yeah, go ahead.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.020
So I'm not sure I'm going to go over the things.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.100
I'm going to look at the things that I want to celebrate.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.380
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I want to do

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.880
in February.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.360
And then I'll talk about the boutique.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.200
and we started September 24th and I spent that time in the rain.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.200
This is something that wasn't very good, so I did a very good job.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:21.200
I was in the pool with my friends and I was in the pool with my friends and I was in the pool with my friends.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.200
We had a really good program going on in the public sector.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.460
and I'm going to show you a little bit of the colors.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.200
I'm going to show you the map, so you can see the colors.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.000
This is for college and college, which is my junior year,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.240
and then for college, I'm going to show you the color.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.840
The color is black.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.040
The color is white.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.240
I have to network to a large field,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.660
so if you want to network to a large field,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.160
you can just go to the bottom of the column

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.460
and you can see the color.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.960
And that's why I'm being able to show you

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.560
the color for the next show.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.560
Thank you, Dr. Karate.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.560
Thank you.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.560
One more.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.560
I guess we'll move this one down here.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.560
Sorry.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.560
Okay.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.560
Okay.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.560
I want to thank everyone at NKD's

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.560
for making this space easy for me

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.560
and for all the faculty, staff,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.560
and technology and construction.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.560
And I hope you all

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.560
enjoyed this. I had a lot to talk about

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.560
and I would continue to do the public

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.560
and local and state government as well as foreign education.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.320
With the mentions of architecture and the U.S.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.720
English continent, she has served as a national architect

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.760
for the University of Wisconsin-Houston

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.800
and as senior public report manager

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.200
for the Department of Human Development in Dallas, Kentucky.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.800
We at RECIWEL do state government and higher education

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.000
coverage and facilities work in Seattle, Washington.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.440
This year, we have partnered with a national presence

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.320
that ability to do these project's.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.580
I guess we're more likely to act as a band

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.160
if you have a brain.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.520
It's much a real thing, but it will be a mistake.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.320
No, I'm just kidding.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.840
No, no.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.340
No, no.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.840
No.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.340
No.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.840
No.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.340
No.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.840
No.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.340
No.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.840
No.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.340
No.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.840
No.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.340
No.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.840
No.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.340
No.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.840
No.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.340
No.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.840
No.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.340
No.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.840
No.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.340
No.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.840
No.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.340
No.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.840
No.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.340
No.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.840
No.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.340
No.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.840
No.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.340
No.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.840
No.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.340
No.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.840
No.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.340
No.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.840
No.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.340
No.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.840
No.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.340
No.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.840
No.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.340
No.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.540
the place for them and it's both state and federal laws that's all new and we can continue

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.340
to support them in the right direction.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.340
And after our two-time president, we're going to start our new election.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.340
We're commuting to next Friday, the 27th of March, on Tuesday.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:51.340
Okay, so we're going to start with one.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.340
And that's number one, that there are no documents when they are in front of those students.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.340
That was first seen in 2004, and that's the 19th semester.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:07.340
So we are at 800-1 students.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:15.340
The number one date that I remember being settled in the week in May was July 3rd.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:21.340
The annual date was June 17th, and I was probably one of the first ones.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.340
I think there were four opinions.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:33.340
And the time I wrote was 1359, and that was the opportunity.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:39.340
And now, on the actual data in fact, the tool is going to defect.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:46.340
And that compares to the average age when it's clearly 1.22, without my 67.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:53.340
And the reason why we're talking about the 57 is because we want to change that question from one person to the other.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.340
And so, I'm sure that people are doing a good job of understanding that.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.340
I started to think that the way I was trying to explain to her was,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.340
I was going to make it more practical.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.340
Right.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.340
Right.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.340
And I made that more practical, and I could do it a million times,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.340
and I had those numbers.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.340
I told you, I was the best teacher.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.340
I'm very grateful.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.340
And we have a season of learning.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.340
Yeah.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.340
Thank you.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.340
Thank you.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.340
I'm going to go out and get out.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.340
I'm going to go out and get out.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.340
I don't know what we should be doing here.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.180
I think we can do a little bit of a

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.100
dialogue and format.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.520
But you know, we can do a little bit more dialogue.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.400
I think that's a good idea.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.700
I think you're all willing to do that.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.780
I don't know if you're involved in the work

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.280
that you're doing.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.580
I always say, go ahead and do it.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.660
But actually, I think you are.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.060
And I'm very interested in that.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.700
OK, and that's one way of doing it.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.260
You have to do that for anything.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Okay. I would go with the reasonable salary.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
I think it's reasonable.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.260
I agree.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Okay.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Dr. Rupi?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
I'm going to go with the reasonable salary.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.260
Okay.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
I have to agree with you there.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.260
I agree.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.260
I agree with you.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
So that's the people's salary.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
The one way you were saying that you could go to the next.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.260
I agree with that.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.260
I agree with the single point that you just said about the pay-as-you-go.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.640
And the impact of each course would be in one way or another,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.760
to stuff around student services as well as instruction.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.500
But not really.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.660
And the difference in the statewide and national work

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.260
is that you have committees that present

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.340
to you and think about that.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.320
But it wasn't really helpful for the students

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.960
because they were on a different campus

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.400
and we utilized that to take a decision.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:44.900
Thank you.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.180
So what if you want to do a video?

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.940
And we have to be careful.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.300
And we are actually giving a class that's

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.280
a point of no return.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.120
We're working on it.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.780
And we're doing it with the moments of one

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.500
more than we expected.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.280
How do we reach out to the data point?

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.320
Data points need to be sure that we keep the information fresh.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.740
We might have to take some of the data out of the data

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.820
Welcome, welcome.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.920
Thank you.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.900
Thank you so much.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.260
Thank you.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.840
Thank you for responding to our session.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.680
Or my own anyway, thank you for your kind attention.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.380
Thank you.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.200
So thank you all for coming to this event and alternatively

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.960
And I think that's one of the things I think that I'll show you.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.880
Once you're ready to go, just put it in.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.820
And you're going to have a good time.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.020
And you're going to have a good time.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.600
And you're going to have a good time.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.260
And you're going to have a good time.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.520
And you're going to see that.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.640
So you're not gaining.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.840
You're not gaining.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.960
So you're not.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.480
So remember that don't try to get the bad rather than get

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.880
the good ones.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.460
It's going to be for everybody's own kind of mental health

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.440
that you're going to have to deal with.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.600
But I did do a little bit of something like that,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.380
and I don't know which was most difficult, except you.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.720
But I did do that.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.340
And I'm very proud of myself.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.220
I'm very proud of myself.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.680
I've made quite a bit of money.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.020
I've been struggling in the market.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:25.520
It's great.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.260
But I'm very proud of what I did.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.120
I will continue to work hard to make money,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.840
to help more and more small businesses.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.160
And I'm going to start with one thing I particularly

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.600
And we'll take a look at the other type of project.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.860
I know a lot of projects that are going to be done in the quarter.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.720
So I think it's going to be a good idea.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.480
But yeah, we just want to make sure that we have 15 million

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.580
of work that we can do for them.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.220
And we're going to try and continue

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.100
working with our agencies.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.560
We don't have to put the bridge.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.460
That's a great point.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.900
That's a good point.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.360
We're going to improve the regulation.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.260
So that was a lot of history.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.300
So that was a lot of history.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.940
Let's go back to the original question.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.100
The other question.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:17.600
Water.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.100
Water.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.600
Water.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.100
Water.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.580
I know that question.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.140
I know that question.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.000
I know that question.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.540
That's probably from the first time

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.620
we looked at the children in the discussion

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.640
about how we should treat these children in the place

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.680
that we all grew up in.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.320
So you're getting these kids.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.360
So, I think we have about a minute or so.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.360
We're going to take a moment to ask you,

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.360
you were making a comment about the challenge,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.360
but I think apparently you've got a few minutes left.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.360
I'm sure we didn't make the whole talk,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.360
but I'll tell you what,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.360
we're actually going to reflect this moment

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.360
as soon as we can,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.360
and we'll be able to wrap it up in a minute.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360
That's good to know.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.360
All right.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.360
There's basically the child on the main tower,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.860
and you're not really in the bottom row.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.600
It's worth looking to see.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.980
And then the first thing I would imagine

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.560
is that all the adults would go to the 36th floor,

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.060
so that would be the last room to the killer.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.020
So that would be the bottom row.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.600
And then at the end of the second half,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.400
you'd see the top row.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.680
So that's how it works.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.480
And that's how you create a shower room.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.480
I didn't think you'd think of that.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.480
And it's just easier and more difficult.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.980
And when I'm not playing, I'm not

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.880
going to be able to do what you're going to do.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.920
And I'm not going to be able to do what I'm going to do.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.260
I'll just be on my own.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.000
And it's just easier.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.540
But there's so many things that I want to do.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.000
And it's just a lot of work.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.240
And I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.000
So we're going to run around and try to reach to them.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.260
Now, we have a one-page file from the program team.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.700
We have 65 of them.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.900
And of course, we're going to do that today.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.440
But we're going to make this video a little bit longer.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.880
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.880
We're going to go ahead and try to address

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.340
the development of the program.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.840
But we're going to go ahead and see if there's

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.460
any questions about that.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.560
I'm going to go ahead and ask them to come in.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.720
I'm going to see if they're interested.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.220
Thank you.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.220
and we're going to have a lot of communication with those folks.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:34.220
All the members of the panel, thank you.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.220
Yes, we have a couple of questions.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.220
We have two questions that were stolen by me.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.220
I put this in the back.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.220
I was like, I'm not going to put it in the back.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.220
I was like, what?

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.220
I'm not going to put it in the back.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.220
I'm very much in awe.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.220
We have two very wonderful comments.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:58.180
We've got a study from the US, a very dangerous system,

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.940
with bad population.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.920
So that's a problem.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.780
That's a problem.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.220
That's a problem.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.840
Now, to actually, which is in 3.1.2,

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.000
remember, we're going to use this one.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.500
What?

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.000
What?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.500
What?

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.000
What?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.500
What?

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.000
What?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.500
What?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.000
What?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.500
What?

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.000
What?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.500
What?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.000
What?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.500
What?

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.000
What?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.500
What?

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.000
What?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.500
What?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.000
What?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.500
What?

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.000
What?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.500
What?

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.120
I mean, you're just a new one.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.840
I can't do anything.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.660
Well, let me start calling the police.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.660
Hey, hey, hey.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.940
What's up?

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.720
It's good to see you.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.480
Thanks for having me.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.520
Thanks for having me.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.360
It's a great time.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:33.860
Thanks.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.180
I hope you're having a lot of fun.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.660
I hope you're having a lot of fun.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.680
Thanks for having me.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.740
I hope you're having a lot of fun.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.020
I hope you're having a lot of fun.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.000
Thanks.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.160
When you get married, how do you find a way to get a job?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.220
That's really hard.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.460
I guess you can find a job.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.720
There's a lot of stuff.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.020
If you're a medical doctor, what is the first and third thing

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.320
that you want to do?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.180
I'm sorry, sir.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.220
If you're a doctor, what is the most important thing

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.220
that you want to do?

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.260
So, for example, if you're a doctor,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.140
you can do a very simple and very fast process.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.920
And then, when you finish, you can do a very simple and very

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.660
quick and very quick process.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.160
Sir?

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.860
Thank you.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.600
Thank you very much.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.780
The last thing I have to say is that I'm not a criminal,

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.200
so I'm not performing a crime, but I'm an attorney.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.360
I'm an attorney for law enforcement,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.480
working for the University of New York City for children.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.720
They were asking around the children's life.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.800
And they were pissed, looking for affection.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.860
That was their answer, too, I think.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.920
They were there.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.760
They couldn't do it because they were boys with children.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.500
They couldn't remember their father and family,

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:53.500
the amount of protection that was provided to the system during that time.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.500
So that number is covered.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:01.500
That number is covered after we show the current value of the system.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.500
Thank you.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500
Thank you.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.500
Thank you.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.500
We have a question we just put in the room.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:17.500
to you know maybe take a radio feed and maybe reverse that for a third and end up with more

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.500
for a third family.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.500
So actually we've got both consumers like that still living on site.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:29.500
So definitely we know we just need to, we do not want the time to have to take them.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.500
We think we've done enough.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.500
We're kind of out of time.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.500
that's the thing that we're doing.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.500
We're not really doing any part of that

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.500
on the computer.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.500
The computer will tell us

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.500
when we're going to do it.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.500
So that's the thing.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.500
But I think it's pretty much

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.500
a very nice challenge for us.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.500
So can you give us

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.500
a little bit more information

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.500
just to tell us a little bit about

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.500
the work that you're doing

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.500
and what you're doing

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.500
in the program?

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.500
Well, we have a lot of

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.500
information.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.500
We have a lot of options

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.500
for the team.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.500
This is a little explanation.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.500
And I would like to bring in, you know, this is going to be a topic that I'm going to revive

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.500
going into the next few months, which is this very important question.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.500
About the trial, I mean, specifically during the last 15 months,

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.500
so, like Fred said, we went through all the decisions that people had to make in terms of

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.500
the treatment and the treatment of the fact that they had a doctor,

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.500
and the reason people had their doctors and the reasons, the reasons and the reasons for the fact that they had a doctor,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:37.500
I mean, kind of a friendly way of looking at it. So, I didn't get to go through and try to talk to people in college.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:43.500
I didn't get to go through and try to do this sort of project, try to do some safety measures.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.500
And so, when we speak, I'm not going to be able to speak to people in the other way, which is like,

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.500
like, I think you're more of a support person than I am a student, I think.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:59.100
Now in Canada, it's a lot of value to base personal decisions upon the value of that

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.100
in the situation.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:06.500
So I was convicted of education for some reason by some practice in the military and by and

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.000
by I felt that I was on the wrong side of the board.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.500
So it's not, we don't feel that I'm in the wrong position.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:17.500
I'm not prepared and I'm not really smart when it comes to the fact that I'm being put

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.500
in that position.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.300
And I would say that since we're in the United States, we are not going to decide what we

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.100
need for the country during the fiscal year.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.500
That's not what we need in the country this year.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.300
And that's basically the answer to that.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.500
I think that is now the case for fiscal year.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.900
We will probably be discussing fiscal year next year.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.500
So, um, we're going to be doing the fiscal year this year and, um, we're going to be

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.100
talking about that in a bit.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:55.100
Okay, there are some remains. It was identified, oh sorry, but there are many sites that have

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.100
been left out of the rotation. The first one we were able to find was the board commission

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:06.100
that was involved with the rotation. This was actually a state law court case, a personal

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:11.100
law court case, and a public court case. So we're not sure where it went. But before we

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.420
that we want to make sure that we do every communication we can to that input,

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.300
to the other positions and other things, to things like Microsoft,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.700
we're doing everything that we can to help that and to help make those questions

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.660
as simple as possible.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.660
Thank you very much.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.380
Thank you for listening to the questions and it's been a lot more fun than I imagined.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.420
Thank you.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.540
Thank you very much.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.340
Thank you.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.540
Thank you.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.580
Thank you.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.620
Thank you.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.580
Thank you.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.140
Thank you.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.140
It's kind of a one way with the other, it's kind of similar.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.140
So, that's not the only story.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:53.140
The other part of it is, I'm sure, the structure for motion 5, that was to win, and at this time,

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:59.140
you had that method that was again, it was a competition of recommendations,

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:04.940
So this is a product of the private company that's

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.620
private to the sponsor.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.920
And my question is, is there a job development

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.700
here that's not a job development?

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.160
And is there a subscription or is there a loan-to-lend?

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.260
Actually, the question is, is purchasing a loan

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.960
a perfect way to get a loan?

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.260
Is it a good way to get a loan?

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.660
and memory, and expression, and learning,

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.500
has been an interesting thing to see.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.400
Because what programs are more effective

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.080
because they help you use the same instruction?

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.540
But these are very, very good.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.920
And then the next problem is that,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.680
as we've been doing, general diagnosis

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.640
is that it's a very interesting or a policy condition.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.560
And there's always been a case with one

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.940
and it's a certain word.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.560
So what we've been talking about,

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.360
and the city of Portland, the city of Portland,

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.060
and the town of Houston,

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.800
the city council of Portland,

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.440
and the city council of Washington,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.900
and the city council of Washington.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.840
So, the city of Portland is the only one of those two towns.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.240
We work on the public health issue,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.480
and there's no statute there prior to that.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.520
So, we have a legislative initiative

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.540
to address the other most important

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.860
and particularly important issues

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.560
in the Washington region.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.060
Thank you.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.060
And it's kind of something that I'm not familiar with.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.560
And I was in my life, and I thought,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.560
oh, we don't need to put the website in.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.180
We have to have a program that shows it.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.300
But it's actually very easy to find.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.900
Yeah, I was wondering, just a question

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.100
that I'm not comfortable with.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.940
The book is in fact, one of the other,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.380
so it was from the board.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.820
And it's a typical book.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.980
So you can require it as a book.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:23:01.460
And I think, I think, I think, I think providing more, more help is helpful to make sure that

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.500
we're never trying to require more help from the other community.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.860
Thank you, Chris.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:14.740
I, I, I would like to say one thing about the worker conference, which is the hiring

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.380
or even more expensive than what you do.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.820
But to make it more expensive, they

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.500
introduced this significant funding

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.500
in the United Nations in the 1920s before.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.140
But contracts, you have to be forward to what we have.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.740
And that's what we're staying for the moment.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.240
Exactly.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.320
That's what we're going for.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:29.820
Yeah.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.320
That's it.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.100
I would like to say that you can go a little bit

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.080
to the right, but we don't know.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.180
And I'm not sure if you have any idea,

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.460
but it's actually a little bit more of a

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.300
you can just go down the thing to literally

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.540
Yeah, we're trying to do it.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.040
Right.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.780
And I know there's not a lot of change,

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.940
but the board, the government, the state,

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.160
the board of state, the government,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.340
the union, the senators, the general board,

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.900
are expecting good results.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.300
I mean, it's not a one-number-billion-tower

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.920
contract, but I think it might be one-number-billion-tower.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.580
But some of our contracts can leave that open.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.060
And it's, you know, I think it's a huge,

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.620
and then what she's doing is she's kind of

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.820
making a kind of sideway, and then

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.920
we're going to go in and do this.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.100
Or I think we'll go to the next section,

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.540
and then we'll go to the next section.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.040
That's fine.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.540
That's fine.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.040
That's fine.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.540
Yeah.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.160
That's kind of cool.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.220
Now, you know, if you're going to be in the club,

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.660
the other way around is to pretend

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.920
that you're not in the club.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.300
So you can do that.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.060
Yeah, I think you can do that.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.820
So I think that even though we're basically

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.820
and the quality of the soil.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.820
And we've got credit for that in our revenue.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.820
So we're going to have a patient case as well.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.820
And there's not a lot of data to be involved with.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.820
Is that a project set up for the community center?

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.820
Yes.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.820
Which we've just now reached the deadline.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.820
And we're going to have a full project.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.820
And that's not to say that the City of New England's

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.820
conference is not to enable district court to have a

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.120
for example, in the Pacific Ocean,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.160
you have a new mapping process.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.820
And some of the cutting and cutting

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.820
and painting, and the location, and the development

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.580
of the site, the site's space, the site's area,

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.060
the types of interfaces, and the kind of processes

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.940
that we have to work on.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.440
Thank you.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:22.940
Yeah.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.440
Thank you.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.440
Thank you very much.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:24.940
Thank you very much.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.440
Thank you.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.860
Thank you all for your input.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.200
And I think that's the end of the slide.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.820
Thank you for your time.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.540
Thank you.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.200
We're going to go through a number of questions.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.740
I actually can't quite remember what to say.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.460
But I need to find something to say on the way.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.540
But I do want to mention, though,

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.860
that you're watching the panel today,

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.500
and information is available.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.580
And if you have any questions about these questions,

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.200
please, let us know in the comments.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.960
That's all, everybody.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.460
All right.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.360
We also have questions from our attendees

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.580
who are watching us on YouTube or Instagram.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.320
So, please, go ahead and contact them.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.060
I don't know if that's a good way to say it.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:05.060
experience. But you know, I'm pretty clear on that. I'm very clear about all of that.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:10.060
Today's report has presented to me some of the most interesting data. It's basically

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:16.060
the most unique data to me. And I know that it's really something that we're probably

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:21.060
going to be able to find today. And I know that we're going to be able to find more of

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:26.060
that data in the next few days. But it's really something that changed. And I'm very

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.060
I'm not sure it's going to be the same to the new audience.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.560
I think it's going to be a little more casual for them.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.060
But in the sense that it would be a record video

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.820
of the new audience today, I would recommend it more.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.680
Because it was part of the new recording,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.560
and we actually have a particular recording that's

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.680
going to be on the wall.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.820
So they're not going to have to be able to recognize

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.400
that it's going to be a record.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.800
So that's it.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.820
That's it for me.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.320
Great.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320
Thank you, everyone.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:51.820
Thank you, Ben.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.900
Thank you, Justin.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.740
Thank you, everyone.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.360
Thank you, Justin.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.360
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.920
But in the classroom we don't need to study that.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.040
DR. All right.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.120
I have another question.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.000
How about you?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.680
I'll give you a chance.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.660
DR. Yeah.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.600
And then, I'll see you during your questions.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.100
DR. OK.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:36.800
I'll see you around.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.500
I'll see you around.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:37.880
DR. OK.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.180
OK, and now I'll see you later.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.200
Oh, I don't know where she's going.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.660
DR. I'll probably just stop it.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.780
I'll just leave it at that.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.580
I think I'm probably going to have to speak with her.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.200
I need to take a break a little.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:49.740
DR. Oh, sure.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.480
That's not bad.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.280
I'm happy to watch.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.080
DR. I'm happy to watch.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:58.520
I have to add that we're charging FAA and FAA power.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.200
And we're actually more than just having that in power.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.000
We're trying to put it down as basic as possible.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.960
And we're actually in the queue for the workshop next

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.880
time around on the week we report in July 2023.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.120
We are in the booth for the workshop January 2024.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.320
And as I said before, we're going out of the election

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.440
day today, so we're sending you a $4.25 voucher.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.040
Thank you so much.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:29.040
I have a question.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:37.040
We initiated the event on this, you said one year, last year, I think.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.040
And you're asking where it's going to be?

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.040
Yeah, I'm actually in the middle of the process.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.040
Right.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:50.040
And my question is, we started, same thing, we started working with the American World

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.540
and the role of the state's law in the system in the use of the new and the old,

00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:00.040
or is the new and the old starting out to keep coming forward?

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.040
Okay. So I think it's a good question.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.040
We're in the week that we can go back and look at whether we can get a divorce law,

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.040
because changes can be made.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.040
We don't need to have a divorce exercise until we have the details.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.540
That's what we're going to go with, and it's a very good question.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.300
And if I'm not going to be more willing to do the work that is going to be done,

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.180
then we will be in a position to not be able to do it.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:24.980
That's right.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.180
And the work that I want to do will be done.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.300
May I have a question?

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.140
Yes, you may have a question.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.180
Hi, Dr. Brown.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.140
I have a question.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:38.660
I'm not sure if we have any other experts to help with the recruitment

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:43.460
recommendations and then examine if we have to really make further campaigns

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.960
that they've gotten out of college.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.840
So it's not a lot of work.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.560
And then you have to, right now, it's like,

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.800
being around.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.340
So then the reality is, you have to do the things

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.140
that are presently there to get questions to talk

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.400
to the right people.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:29:59.900
Yeah.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:00.400
Hi.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.060
I'm from the University of Florida,

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.860
and I'm just trying to get some information

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.480
in as we're trying to recover these workshops

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.780
and see how things continue.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.280
We're working to get specifically

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.040
to those areas that we have an uproar in the military population as well.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.080
And I'm disappointed in them, but I don't want to put any of that in the presenting

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.520
of yours, it's a collaboration.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.240
I'm not going to be able to let them, I'm not going to put things out in front of the

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.560
prior Senate, and then when we're looking to look at that summit, we're going to be

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.160
saying that and making point of the same action and taking care of the study.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:34.960
I understand.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.600
Thank you.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.560
Thank you, Dr. Moser.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.520
Thank you, Dr. Moser.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.320
Thank you.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.120
Thank you.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.320
Thank you.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.320
So I think that's the kind of thing that we're looking for in the professional environment.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.320
Thank you.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.320
Thank you.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.320
Thank you.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.320
Thank you.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.320
I have a question.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.320
I could maybe ask one of them.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.320
I think this is going a little bit to the side of the body.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.320
So I'm just going to take this one from the front.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.320
I think you can take it from the side of the body.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.320
So I have a question.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.400
And then we have a moment here with a recent issue of the Professor and the Man in the

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.400
Church Association.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.400
I'm looking forward to that.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.400
Professor, I'm on my way to your question.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.400
I'm looking forward to that.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.400
We do have a meeting in the next few days.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:27.400
So, we are all talking about the history of church movement and how we know it's been

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.400
a good thing.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.400
Obviously, we are thinking about the other of the Man in the Church Association.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:38.900
So that's why I pointed to my field and then I was worried.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.980
Yeah, that's the question.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.620
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.280
No, I'm saying that's really helpful,

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.440
because I was a child was there.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.340
Yeah.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.060
But it's important.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.620
Yeah, it's been interesting.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.080
I'll go ahead and get the mic ready.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.920
Thank you.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.420
I'm sorry.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.920
That's good.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.960
I was talking to you about the right hander.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.580
Thank you.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.580
Check.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.080
We'll get it.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:57.560
We'll get it.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.560
Great.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.040
So I'm going to go ahead and use the microphone.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.040
I came down for a couple of days and I was like,

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.040
I'm not very much worried about some of these taxes.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.040
I thought, what are we going to do?

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.040
I thought, well, we're going to do a grant.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.040
You know, we've got to do something about it.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.040
So we're going to say that, you know,

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.040
this is what I want to do.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.040
And I think that's what I'm going to do.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.040
And I think that we're still waiting on the tax returns.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.040
But I think it's a good thing.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.440
I'm going to talk about drones, but that's basically it.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.440
I hope you can see it.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.360
I'm going to talk about drones.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:42.720
So what that means is that the technology that you buy,

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.220
the technology that you can learn,

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.680
what you can learn, what you can do,

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.680
it's kind of special.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.720
It's a good space.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.960
And you're either going to run a lot of your own,

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.280
or you're going to run a lot of your own.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.580
the community, it's already a model of the current outcome.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.080
Right?

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.380
So, the different kinds of universities that I've been

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:08.380
in, the one that I grew up in, the one that I'm still in,

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.980
the one that I'm still in, the one that I'm still in,

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.080
is a very good question.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080
Sure.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.480
How would you put that?

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.280
I don't know.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.880
I don't know if that would actually be a good question.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.480
I don't know what it is, but it's a good question.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.080
I would say that from one point of view,

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.480
it's sort of, you know, probably,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.480
So I think there's a lot of people who are

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.880
going to be more interested in this.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.100
Thank you.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.640
I have a question.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.140
Because we're going to have to see this

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.100
in the next webinar, of course, why

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.360
is it that we're going to see this?

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.860
Because we're going to have to see this.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.240
So we're going to have to see this.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.200
We're going to have to see this.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.240
We're going to have to see this.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:43.860
It's a bucket.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.360
It's a bucket.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.280
So it's going to be a bucket.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.320
Well, then you might want to see that picture

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.320
I think that's a really good point, that more people need to take the medicine.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:02.320
You know, I've been, I've been might as well be in a treatment center now.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:08.320
I've been, might as well be there. I've been raised around the country.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.320
Yeah.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:18.300
to be able to confront, or encourage, or encourage or help each other, I think,

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.080
try to do that in the most practical way.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.699
I think that's what we need to do.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.659
But I would say that's the only chance to do it, if you want to be a part of this,

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.199
because I think it's really important to try to do it.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:31.880
Well, I'm not a part of this.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.179
I think that is a fact.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.040
I don't think so.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.100
I think that's very good.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.560
I don't think we have to be a part of this.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.199
actually, we're going to have to do that.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.860
We've never done that work in the last few years,

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.320
so that's a little bit of a problem.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.020
I think she took it really nicely.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.400
She's doing it from the bottom.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.060
So yeah, she was looking at the

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.500
financial side of things.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.000
Thank you.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.740
Thank you.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.700
That's the last one.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.900
We're kind of on vacation.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.840
So we're going to do the new check.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.960
whether that would be in with the national special needs.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.760
So this is quite a succession of different words about what

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.540
makes an FDA career in the United States.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.360
I like that.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.080
Thank you very much.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.520
So I just wanted to make sure you could hear it.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.200
That's very important to see.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:27.700
Thank you.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.340
I'm going to show coverage from more than a few of these

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.440
slides.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.340
I think we're going to lose a little trouble providing

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.340
I'm sorry, one more question.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:54.340
I'm not sure how long the conversation was to give you the chance to follow up and request that the board

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:59.920
said, sometimes we're out in a room playing,

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.820
and our police keep them on screen.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:10.160
The way to campus work is to campus you.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.680
And that is one of the things I've

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.020
been with faculty here before, and I

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.820
like to get involved.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.060
And again, I know this will be a little bit of a different

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.440
session, but I'd like to let you know how our relatives

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.540
of our protocols for emergency situations on campus.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.080
And now that we have people on campus,

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.940
we're able to understand that we are playing

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.940
those sorts of plays that we're used to being in.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.120
We have to pick a building up and rush in.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.880
But we understand we're not going

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.120
to be doing that about those work that

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.720
And then you have to realize that just by the moment you had props on it, something might happen.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.720
So that's one of the important things over here.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.720
Thank you.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:06.720
I'm going to read the first or special line, and I can read the rest of the text.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.720
I want to see if I can read it.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.720
I'm going to read it.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.720
I'm going to read it.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:19.080
And then the workshop will follow, and then at one point in the year, we'll have a workshop

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:25.320
for second-to-second course, special lessons, so that's very, very normally what we have.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.560
And then we'll have a program for the executive session of college, which will be a very

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.560
terrific project.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560
Thank you.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.560
Thank you, Paul.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.560
Thank you, Paul.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.560
Thank you, Paul.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560
Thank you, Paul.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560
Thank you, Paul.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.560
Thank you, Paul.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.560
Thank you, Paul.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560
Thank you, Paul.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.560
Thank you, Paul.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.560
I think we have a pretty good chance of doing a point-and-a-half-minute shorter.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.560
I think we have a pretty good chance of being, certainly, you know,

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.560
we have a pretty good chance of, you know,

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.560
losing 50% of the energy, and I don't want to go into that.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.560
I think we have a pretty good chance of getting to a point where we can get the solution.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.560
We're also on the percentage level that we should be at.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.560
So I think we'll see.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.560
We'll see.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.560
We'll see how it goes.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.560
Thank you.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.560
And I hope you enjoyed this video.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.560
And if you have any questions,

please feel free to ask them in the comments.

And I hope you enjoyed this video.

Thank you.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.180

you

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.180
you

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.180
you

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.180
you

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.180
you

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.180
you

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.180
you

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.180
you

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.180
you

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.180
you

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.180
you

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.180
you

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.180
you

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.180
you

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.180
you

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.180
you

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.180
you

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.180
you

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.180
you

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.180
you

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.180
you

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.180
you

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.180
you

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.180
you

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.180
you

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.180
you

01:18:34.560 --> 01:19:04.540
Thank you.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.560
Thank you.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:37.560
I mean, I think it's a good thing.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560
Well, what about for the test?

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.560
I mean, just to assess the level of the flux in this test,

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.560
I mean, the core end sets the level down.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.560
The main guarantee value, what's the ratio of the method?

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:51.560
The test started after we looked at the end, you know.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.560
Is that correct?

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.560
Yeah.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.560
Yeah, I agree.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:58.560
And for a few year-long weeks, we're seeing the copy,

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.560
and we're seeing the copy, and we're seeing the value portion,

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:06.560
and the reaction to the other one, I think, is we'd be curious to see if it would form

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:09.560
a more beneficial role in the transition.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.560
Well, the reasons we're watching are very similar.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.560
We have a close to the end, starting to go over, trying to get more highlights.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.560
But, we've got a better outlook, and it's a big one for us.
