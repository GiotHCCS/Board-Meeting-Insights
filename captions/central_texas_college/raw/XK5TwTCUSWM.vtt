WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
We are constantly looking at the future,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.380
looking at the future, looking at the future,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.140
looking at the future, looking at the future.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.160
That's what we're looking at.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.640
And that's what we're looking at.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.680
Well, we have to go to the final level.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.060
And from the final level, I think,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.680
change is very, very, very important.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.460
We don't want to lose the final level.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.400
The final level is where we start to go.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.280
And it's good timing to do it.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.080
This one here is pretty strong now.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.180
So I'm going to do a little bit of a test.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.580
So I think I just want to make sure that you know,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.400
I'm going to show you how to do this.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.200
So let's just say that I'm going to put some of this in here.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.840
And I'm going to put this in here.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.960
I'm going to put this in here.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.640
So I'm going to just put this in here.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.400
And so I'm just going to put this in here.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.520
I'm going to put this in here.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.520
And then, of course, we're going to have to make some big steps to set up for the beginning.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.520
And then, a little bit later, we'll have to find out how we can probably set up.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.520
Yeah, I should get a membership or what that is.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520
Everybody's a champion.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.520
Yeah.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.520
I think that's it.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520
I think that's it.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.520
I think that's it.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520
I think that's it.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.800
See, the air is a little bit replaceable, a little bit.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.480
That's why we wanted to make that second one more a little bit more flexible.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.980
So this is a commercial air and you're gonna have to do right, there's a box in the middle

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.180
of the air that's gonna be a multi-tool.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.980
Multiple tools.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.840
That's gonna be a multi-tool, that's gonna be a multi-tool.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.560
Yeah.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.420
I want it to be a multi-tool.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.500
It's gonna have to be a multi-tool.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.280
Yeah.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.140
It's gonna be a multi-tool.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.940
Yeah.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.400
So, for something that we're gonna add more, that's a card.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.400
How did you get others to come and see your public school?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.400
And is this one time for current students or about any of these things?

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.400
And when did it end?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400
And just sorry.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400
I can't remember.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400
I think we should have asked them to do that.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.400
How do you charge for the response to the first one to see the office?

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.400
And then, so, I'm going to go to the second one to be sure.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.400
And you said it was the first one to see the office.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400
Yes.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400
And that's what I'm going to do.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.960
I think we need to do that quickly.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.880
But, of course, the resolution of campus recommended to the main

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.080
department of the entire college.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.740
I believe that's the case.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.080
It's not a dramatic slip.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.580
We have to talk about what really is and how it is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.720
going to affect us.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.720
And one of the problems I believe that we've discussed

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.560
So what I've done is basically I've been removing the hair to the fastest level.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.080
That's called deep testing.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.200
Of course, what I've done is I've stretched him.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.680
I've cut over the edge of him also braiding.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.200
And I've done this a great job.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.680
The focus for environmental and genetic testing is going to be for E. coli 25, 15, 20% with

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.440
Or anywhere else, in theory.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.920
Probably less expensive than this one here.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.220
And we don't expect this to be a good decision.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.720
But, anyway, I appreciate your time.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.220
Thank you.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.680
Thank you.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680
Is there any questions?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680
Any other questions?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.180
No.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.680
No.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.180
No.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.680
No.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.180
No.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.680
No.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.180
No.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.680
No.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.180
No.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.680
No.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.180
No.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.680
No.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.180
No.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.680
No.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.180
No.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.680
No.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.180
No.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.680
No.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.180
No.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.680
No.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.180
No.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.680
No.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.180
No.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.680
No.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.180
No.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.680
No.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.180
No.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.680
No.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.180
No.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.680
No.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.180
No.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.680
No.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.180
No.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.180
and privacy for the video.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.180
And we're going to use a multi-site display,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.180
which is sort of a multi-platform,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.180
which is what we call a tele-sense display.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.180
So, if you're going to use a multi-site display,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.180
you're going to have a number of different stages

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.180
of its use, which is simple.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.180
Don't use a multi-site display,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.180
because it's just a picture.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.180
The more the site is used,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.180
the more the video gets more active,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.180
and the more the experience and the effects

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.180
and the effects.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.180
And of course, the facts,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.180
we're going to look at your table. Teasers are this big, you can get around that much

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.180
tissue and you can get around that much tissue. And you can get around that much tissue.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.180
And you can get around that much tissue. And this is for, now we're going to do pre-겠죠

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.180
and pre-adjuvant, and pre-adjuvant, and pre-adjuvant. And I had a slide, I didn't know any of it

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.180
was there at all. But anyway, so we have these two contact lenses, these two contacts and

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.020
And that's why she's really working for the White House on this thing.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.220
Um, I don't know if she and Kelly have mentioned it, but I was wondering where she and Kelly

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.220
are participating.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.220
I don't think I'll be seeing you there.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.220
I think if you're on the White House, I would love to meet up.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.220
I'm going to be there on the 4th of March and get to see you there before the 4th of

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.220
March.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.220
And so, I'm going to be here, so I'm going to be there again.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.220
And I'm going to be here for the rest of the week.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.220
Thank you.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.220
Thank you.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.840
Yes, Lawrence will do his first round in Russia.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.640
First round in Denmark with Robert Tsoag.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640
Yes.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.080
And we have a second round with France.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.580
We have a second round in the Netherlands with France.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.400
And then France will be the winner in the second round of the session.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.140
Okay, we will have a chance to be third, so if you can reach your point in the show,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.140
Thank you so much.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.140
Thank you so much.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.140
This is the Jeremiah Center there.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.140
We will do our reports now,

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.140
or should I say, it is now

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.140
and come over for the general

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.140
or the status or the

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.140
the second session will go on.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.140
But this is where we will do

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.140
the sessions and the interviews

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.140
and then we will get to the

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.140
final discussion.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.140
Thank you.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:08.420
Thank you.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.760
you

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.760
you

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.760
you

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:01.760
you

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.760
you

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.760
you

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.760
you

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.760
you

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.760
you

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.760
you

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.760
you

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.760
you

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:31.760
you

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:01.760
you

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.760
you

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.760
you

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.760
you

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.760
you

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:31.760
you

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:01.760
you

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.760
you

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:01.760
you

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:31.760
you

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:01.760
you

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.760
you

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.760
you

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.760
you

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.760
you

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:31.760
you

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:01.760
you

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:31.760
you

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.760
you

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:31.760
you

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.760
you

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:31.760
you

The American Pronunciation Guide Presents ''How to Pronounce Deer''

00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.140
Deer.

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.140
Deer.

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.140
Deer.

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.140
Deer.

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.140

I appreciate the point that you made.

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.140
Thank you very much.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.140
Thank you.

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.140
I have a question.

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:43.140
I was wondering if there are any opportunities for contracts with the federal group.

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:47.140
Would be nice to see the contract with the federal group.

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.140
I don't know if there's any.

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.140
I don't know if there's any.

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.140
I think there's a chance that there's some.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.140
I think there's a chance that there's some.

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.140
So, this is what it looks like.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.140
And, we have a little bit of a test page.

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.140
And, we have a little bit of a little bit of a rush.

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:08.140
And, we have a little bit of a change.

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:12.140
Change from the normal routine to the new routine.

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:17.140
So, that's the magic news.

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:19.140
That's our news.

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.140
That's our news.

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:21.140
So, that's what it is.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.140
We are moving into July 15th.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.580
to be a manifestation.

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.080
Thank you everyone here today.

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.040
There were a lot of examples today.

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.540
I'm sorry that I had to sign off for that.

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:36.420
I just wanted to talk to you in the Demonucheist

00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:38.040
on some personal point of view.

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.140
And to everyone who worked with me on this,

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.940
on this side, on this back,

00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:43.460

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:44.460

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:45.460
on the left-side, on the right-side,

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:46.400
on the left-side, on the very right side,
