WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
you can make cuts, you can cut the meat with a knife, you can use a knife,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.200
you can use a knife for a steak or a chicken, I don't think so.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.000
I don't think so.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.640
I don't think so.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.840
Yeah.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.480
I don't think so.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.960
What was that?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960
The back of the chain?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.560
No, it's not the back.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.960
The back of the chain was in the back, and I was very, very sad and I didn't know.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.280
I was very sad with the back of the chain, with the knife, I was very sad with the knife.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.520
I mean it's good timing because we've been talking about this for a long time now.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:37.080
So, I'm really enjoying the fact that I can just sit with my mind at home and I can just

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.280
chill out and just kind of sit at the same time.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.560
I think that's one of the things I think is important.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.840
I think that's a really good example of how to have this kind of space.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.380
So we have some examples here.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.040
You see this is a small piece of a test.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.240
I'm going to roll it over to you.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.720
It's a little bit bigger.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.220
And you're going to try to roll it over from the spot

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.920
that's right at the corner.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.220
You're going to roll it over and put it in a little hole.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.120
And I'm going to roll it over to you.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.600
And you're going to move this a little bit.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.840
And you're going to roll it over to me.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.440
And I'm going to get this on the wall.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.880
I think that's what we'll do.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.120
We'll take a few minutes to think.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.280
We'll take a few minutes to think because it was not as

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.320
exciting as it was in the past.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.000
It was a lot of fun.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.120
I know.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.360
And so it was a lot of fun.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.760
It was a lot of fun.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.680
I see a few of you on the stand.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.800
You guys are still going.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.840
I'm going to have to work this game out.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.400
So if you want to come in and talk to me.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.560
I'll come in.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.520
So I'm going to have to be pretty loud.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.720
No, no, no.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.200
I'm just going to help.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.080
I'm going to help.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.000
but let me just stand on a little bit of water at the end there?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.820
Of course

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.440
We really need to do this ...

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.780
Great, so we really just want to find the perfect seja restraina

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.340
So I picked the ones that were in the T into 4

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.080
Does everybody

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.760
I think we're in 4

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.500
Is everybody all right?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.080
Yes

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.240
Okay

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.639
We also do these Palm Paul friends

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.300
So the one that's more french Technically

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.280
The one that's not tenemos

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.160
What?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.640
and not just one minute watching, I think it's easy to do that, but how closely do you watch your campus,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.800
where do you make it to the main campus, where do you monitor your students, how do you monitor your students?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.640
This is one of the methods that we use to talk about what really is environmental science and science.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.640
So, I don't know what I would have done if we had discussed the water quality basically.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.640
I don't know what I would have done if we had discussed this one.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:57.640
We would have called it deep testing, of course, but I don't think the administration would have ever been able to do it.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:07.640
Also, Brady and some of the other members of the group that purchased for environmental and geological testing for the fish at U-25.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.440
We are at 15.6% which is a little bit higher than the average.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.240
So I think this is one of the conditions that we're in.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.040
We don't expect this to happen for 55% of the university campus.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040
Okay.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.540
So that's my question.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.040
Do you have any other questions?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040
No.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040
Okay.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.040
So I have a question for you.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.040
I have a question for you.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040
Okay.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040
So I have a question for you.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040
So I have a question for you.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040
Okay.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040
So I have a question for you.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040
So I have a question for you.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040
So I have a question for you.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040
Okay.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.040
So, let's go. So, first, we're going to go through this list, and we're going to get some

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.040
different answers over here. And we're going to use the numbers like this. I see some sort

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.040
of a warning, to be careful with this. So, I'm going to use those numbers. I'm going

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.040
to use the numbers that I just gave you, which is the same number, and I'm going to use my

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.040
standard for that list, which is the next one. And now, what does this say? It says

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.040
the number of people who live in the area, and that's the numbers that the community

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.600
the key is in fact in the CDX.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.200
Now, there is a key that opens the facts,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:17.279
which is the

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.279
Thank you.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.279
Thank you for the presentation.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.280
Now I'm going to introduce the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.280
chair of the program,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.280
and chair of the board of trustees.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.280
Thank you.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.280
I'm going to start with

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.280
Dr. Lange.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.280
Thank you.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.280
My name is Lange,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.280
and I'm the chair of the board of trustees.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.280
I'm the chair of the board of trustees

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.280
and I'm going to be working

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.280
on the project that is

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.920
coming up with new ideas. I think in your opinion, it's not so much being a, a reviewer

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.280
and a coordinator, it's a different kind of approach to the country. And so I'm going

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.280
to make sure, I'm going to do it again. And I'm going to make my decision here on September

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280
1st.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280
Thank you very much.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280
I'm going to take your time.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280
Thank you very much.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.280
I want to thank you.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280
Thank you very much.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.280
So, I'm going to take your time.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.280
Thank you.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.280
Now, I want to make sure that we can continue.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.280
Thank you.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280
Yes.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.280
Thank you very much.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.280
Thank you.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.280
Thank you.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.280
Okay.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.280
So, we have a new one.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.280
Okay.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.280
So, this is the first one.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.280
So, this will be in the video session.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.280
And then we will continue

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.280
with the

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.280
more questions we can send.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.280
So, I'm going to go back to the session.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.280
Okay.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280
So,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.280
these are the guidelines for

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.280
the new one.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.280
So, we have the first one.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.280
for the general public, and for the central government,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.280
and the central government will have a discussion.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.280
And the discussion will continue to be a little bit

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.280
more of a discussion, but I'm looking forward to it.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280
Thank you.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280
Thank you.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280
Thank you.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280
Thank you.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.900
you

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.900
you

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.900
you

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.900
you

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:11.900
you

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:41.900
you

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.900
you

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.900
you

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:11.900
you

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.900
you

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.900
you

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:41.900
you

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:11.900
you

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:41.900
you

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:11.900
you

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:41.900
you

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:11.900
you

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.900
you

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:11.900
you

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:41.900
you

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:11.900
you

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:41.900
you

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:11.900
you

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:41.900
you

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:11.900
you

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:41.900
you

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.900
you

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.900
you

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:11.900
you

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:41.900
you

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.900
you

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:41.900
you

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:11.900

you

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:41.900
you

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:11.900
you

you

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.900
you

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:41.900
you

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:11.900
you

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:41.900
you

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:11.900
you

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:41.900
you

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:11.900
you

you

00:56:41.280 --> 00:57:11.260
Thank you.

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:16.280
I think it's a good idea to do some

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:21.280
work on this because it's

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:26.280
a very important thing to see that it's going

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:31.280
to be a very important thing to do.

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:36.280
Thank you very much.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:44.280
If there's any opportunities for contracts with the federal group, we'll be on it.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.280
So you can try to get something out of it.

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.280
I want to present this as a chance to present this as a chance to present this as an opportunity.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.280
So this is an opportunity.

00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:08.340
This is a very good example of a very long distance and we see more than 120 km over the rest and having more, and

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:14.280
the same number of other data trees is little bit more important.

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:20.020
So, that's it, I hope you've had a good look at the special base.

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:24.420
We've got two guys, we're going to get you on a 50-day job.

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.860
That's the main solution.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:26.940
Okay.

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.860
Thank you.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.640
And we're going to get you on a 50-day job.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.560
Okay.

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.440
Thank you so much.

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:33.340
All right.

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:34.160
We'll see you in the summer.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:34.840
Thanks, guys.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.540
Thank you.

00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:36.260
Bye, guys.

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:36.840
Bye, guys.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:37.760
Thanks for having me.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.540
I appreciate it.

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:39.040
Thanks.

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:39.800
Thanks for having me.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:40.540
I appreciate it.

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:41.100
I appreciate it.

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.020
Thanks, guys.

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:42.700
Thanks, guys.

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:43.520
Bye, guys.

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.280
Thanks, guys.

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.500
Bye, guys.

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.380
Bye, guys.
