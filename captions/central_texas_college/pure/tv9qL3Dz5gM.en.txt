easy and i think that is what we have done we will let her decide whether the easy part is welcome thank you for coming would you like to share something with us i think dr carter said it all pretty much but i thank you for your confidence in me please know that i will do my very best

i do not know how to do anything under 300 and so that is what i will always give and i hope that just since may 1st you have noticed an uptick in our media coverage both television and in the newspaper and we will continue to do that so i always say central texas college is a hidden gem

if we do not tell our own story who is telling it and so that is our responsibility and all of us including all of you are ambassadors and spokespersons for this college so please speak out please speak often and please be accurate so i love it i love it next item legislative update on the federal level the

budget reconciliation as you know is under review and so for that for us our sector community college sector this is extremely important some of the proposed changes or proposals in that bill include deep cuts to federal funding for our students particularly with pel so we will continue to watch that closely and report back to you at the

state level senate bill 2615 which hit our radar a couple of weeks ago following our last meeting it relates to restricting remote work by employees of public institutions of higher education you can only imagine the uproar that caused when you talk about when you talk about online learning so we have so many academic and we are it

is not distinctive to central texas college or unique to us but we have many academic and workforce programs that are completely online not to mention you know the some of the other business that we conduct online and so this is huge we have many faculty that do not even work in this state let alone our region so

to ask those folks to come back to campus is virtually and to work from main campus is virtually impossible so of course it was met with much opposition we have engaged tac and the ceos are working with the with ray martinez our ceo there to determine whether or not we would you know provide any testimonial but in

the meantime there was a meeting today and it was canceled if that was not the only item on the agenda but it was cancelled in the meantime community college presidents and chancellors such as myself we have reached out to our legislators to let them know that this is a very bad bill and that the the implications for

all of us are significant so we will keep an eye on that and keep you updated senate bill 1786 we have been talking about that all session it will allow transfers to private and independent colleges and universities to count toward the community college finance outcome and so that is currently on the governor's desk waiting currently on the

governor's desk waiting for signature senate bill 1569 relating to the availability of certain personal information and miss briggs you can chime in at any time relating to the availability of certain personal information of a member of the governing board of an institution or ceo of an institution of higher education was sent to the governor on may 13th

for signature the the goal of this bill is to enhance privacy pro protections for the board and for the ceo college president or chancellor senate bill 2529 raises the voting threshold i think we talked about this a couple of meetings ago it raises the voting threshold for local governments to approve certain tax rate increases and general bond

obligate obligation bond issuances 60 under this bill 60 of the governing body is required to issue bonds and 75 of the governing body is required to approve a tax rate that exceeds the voter approval rate so those are the highlights for now as you know we are about to wrap up the session i do not you know

there may be a special session afterwards but but we will keep we will keep an eye on things and report back to you next week which will be the last meeting that we have before the session ends let us see fiscal year 2026 budget update doug you feel free to jump in at any time but basically we

departmental budgets were as we previously mentioned were due on may 1st so doug along with the administration we are working through those expenditure requests to ensure that we have everything that we need may not include everything that we want but everything that we need appropriations we are expecting to have that information by the end of this month

we do not have it now so it is kind of difficult to do a comprehensive budget update at this time without that as well as taxes i do believe that well dr garrett's going to give where's dr garrett at okay there she is she'll give us she'll give us an update on enrollments for fall but in terms

of tuition revenue and planning for the budget we will continue to do what we have done and that is you know budget with a flat budget flat for that we do not want to escalate those numbers unnecessarily and give an inaccurate picture of the budget of course the goal is to present you with a balanced budget so

doug do you have anything to add to so doug do you have anything to add to that well good afternoon new board members i am robin garrett i am the vice chancellor of academic and student chancellor of academic and student success the chancellor asked me to just give you a quick little update on the summer session we

are two weeks out of starting we have two weeks left of registration and we have surpassed the 2023 enrollment numbers so that is great news and for the 2024 we are just short under just under 500 enrollments so we are going to definitely have plenty of time to surpass that so we are looking really good for summer

one summer two it is still climbing we are working on summer two and you'd mentioned fall we do not registration does not open till june for fall yet so we do not have any numbers for that just yet but we are excited about the two weeks left and as you know students tend to wait till the last

minute so we are very busy we are in the throws of registration right now any questions just a comment i saw an article about from a young lady one of our students and she was just addressing how her experience here had been so positive that was just rewarding for me to know that students some students still see

us that way and it is also was a message to those that will be coming i thought it was appropriately where is thought it was appropriately where is she appropriately timed for registration where i do not know if any of you saw it or not but you should look it up online and dr carter you knew you

know her because when i sent the article to you knew the name yes so i just think that doing things like that and reminding students that this is a great place to start yes it is affordable and all the things that we talk about so that was great to see the article about that the other day wonderful

thank you thank you for what you do thank you thank you anything else thank you thank you dr carter anybody questions for dr carter next item is a new program miss carter next item is a new program miss martin good afternoon everyone i am tracy martin from the computer information technology and systems department and i am the

department chair so the two programs that we are asking your approval of is the first one is software development and programming this is a aas or an associate of applied science in software development and programming it is designed to prepare our students for entrylevel careers in the dynamic and rapidly evolving field of software development it'll provide a

strong foundation in programming logic software design and application development and they will gain some hands-on experience with industry ready or industry standard programming languages and develop tools and project methodologies some of the jobs that they will be looking at right now in that field it is expected to grow about seventeen from 2023 to 2020 to 2033 so

it is a significant outpacing in the average growth for all outpacing in the average growth for all the occupations so let us see the other program that we are asking approval for i am sorry it is two they are two separate agenda items oh i am sorry okay anyone have any question about the first item the first

item yeah i have a question as i am reviewing this one i think it is a great idea if we are not thinking automation of computers then we are decades behind the power curve right with regard to the advisory board u what i got from looking at that is it is it seems like really collehen and fort

kavaso centric and i am just wondering if we need to reach out to any of our other local communities in like the isds or the local banks that have it type responsibilities as well to maybe pull some of those folks in to be advisors and not only to gain from their knowledge but to ensure that the various

communities are also bought in to what we are doing and they know what we are doing sometimes may wonder like oh what is ctc doing just like we may wonder well what is this town x doing if we do not reach out and kind of pull them in to what we do and i am all happy to

recommend names and all that i have cleared with a couple folks hey can i throw your name under the bus here and one i haven't heard back from but he does not live locally he is a extended family member who is a white hat hacker okay in a big highpaying job and he graduated college about four years

ago maybe i'd be happy to entertain that we do have a couple of people that are from tridium which is also in tennessee too so we have some people there too but we haven't reached out to a lot of other people so i'd be happy to take yeah i think it just maybe intuitively that it might be

a good idea that we have this taxing base that we are a part of and search within that taxing base so that they kind of get oh well that is what ct is my mortgage goes to this person too or this entity and when we invite them then they kind of get the oh that is what we

do okay so that is my recommendation and we will have to we will have to approve this program next week before you start doing some of those things right thank you miss martin dr cloon wants to answer good afternoon i just want to extend thank you for that observation it is been something that we have been working

on since i arrived nine months ago we are in the process of redis reimagining our employer engagement model completely cool trying to move away from the advisory board model that is not as engaging and creating tiers of partnership we are piloting that right now miss martin's doing amazing job with the launch of our it academy at fort

kabazos so you will be seeing that change and a more diversity and a deeper engagement level of the employers and so i just want to make sure you were aware of the other things that we are working on broadly even beyond her program for all of instruction perfect thank you will this also include maybe job placement at

the end the that would be a tracking model to be able to track it right so we are looking at basically a bronze silver gold and platinum level of engagement and the higher the level of engagement the more involvement where when you are at the platinum level you are doing apprenticeships and you are doing externships and things

of that nature if you are bronze you may come in and do a panel with the class or that kind of thing if you are at gold you will be doing project based with projects with us in the classroom supporting the curriculum so we are really excited about it i am giving you all a little preview though

we look forward to sharing that with you more i am excited about that thank you thank you anyone else question and my concern is the same concern i have about anytime we are implementing a new project a new plan a degree plan have you already well once we approve it i am assuming it will be approve it

i am assuming it will be approved is there an instrument with which you will measure its success and i have been saying this ever since i have been on the board we have to eliminate programs that are not effective that are not effective she is not done with you yet you might as well stay but i just

we like all institutions and all organizations i need us to always look back do a look back a reflection on is this program actually working is are people or students enrolling in this program is there some ch are there some changes that we need to make but when the program is when you are asking for approval i

am just speaking for one board member i would like to see us come with an evaluation plan already in place does that make sense yes sir with the does that make sense yes sir with the job so we already have an evaluation process in place we have to have it to be accredited what we want to work

on and the plan is to spend this next academic year basically i have declared from my vantage point as a vice chancellor a moratorum on new programs except for the most urgent of programs based upon employer outreach which will give us an opportunity to actually fully go through the process that we have in place to evaluate the

effectiveness i would like to see a report card that comes in that talks about completion retention how we are doing with the wages because we could be graduating students but if they are not getting a family sustaining wage then that means that we still need to think about that we do not want to graduate students where they

do not have a job that pays well so it is coming and this next year is going to be a lot of work but the academic leaders are up to the task and i look forward to getting your feedback on the first report cards that will be coming to you and be available for future requests thank you

you are welcome thank you m anyone else okay on the second the second item we will be looking at for next week okay so that one is the data and software systems this one is also an associate of applied science and its pathway is designed to equip individuals with the skills needed to manage maintain and secure data

systems for businesses and organizations it is more like a database kind of program where we are trying to teach them a little bit more about program or databases program or databases question thank you very much appreciate it next item on the agenda is contract renewal with lot burning and company okay the first renewal is with lot vernon

this will be the last auction year on their contract very pleased with their services i think everybody's familiar with them and i would recommend that that this be accepted next week at 74 zero any questions of this how long will this extension last second we will have to go out probably next december january we will go out

with another proposal for to do this all over again okay so this is their last year okay is there an opportunity i have forgotten what we have done in the past so is there an opportunity if that is who we who the only person only company that bids would we do we have the authority to approve continuing

to work with them yes yeah there was a while back there was a federal law that tried to restrict that called sarbain oxley and but it was just a recommendation and i tell you one thing that the that the that the act missed was the experience of an ar and that is big time important so we will

see who sends in a proposal when it when it comes time anyone else thank you while you are there you have another contract renewal with bank of america once again pleased with them and all three of these have signed this new this new statement that the state's requiring now regarding boycotting israel firearms being a part of sudan

or iran and four other things that are required now they have all these three have signed this statement with bank of america i am going to estimate this is going to be between 70 and 80 zero a year i do not know because it depends on the transactions that we that we send through there but we are

pleased with their online system their response to our request and we are just real happy with it so i would recommend that you approve this would recommend that you approve this also questions and then with hilltop securities and with hilltop we have a we have had a long probably about a five or six year relationship with hilltop

they advise me on what to buy we do not ever sell anything but it is mainly when we when we have available cash u what to buy and then they so it serve as the broker on that and this one will probably not go over 50 it'll probably be somewhere around 40 35 to 40 but it depends

on it is another one of those depends on the size of the portfolio there is a percentage that is applied to the portfolio so i cannot there is not an exact number to say between 35 and 40 are they the only vendor for this or is there other this one is continuation is there other this one is

continuation okay yeah with this one and the bank of america both one of the things i like to do is try to get local as much as we can and i am sure there is a lot of machinations that drive us to use a larger firm like bank of america or hilltop i believe they are out of

dallas or this firm that we deal with is out of austin and they are they are heavy in public funds okay just i guess my thought whether if there is a local capacity i'd like to research those just okay why not that versus why this too okay and just if it is the best thing going then i

am good with it i just want to make sure that we how good it is right now okay they understand our business they understand our investment policy and at this point in time i think they are the best okay and they also deal with a lot of other clients that are in public funds with bank of america

i am not too sure how many banks out there can handle what we do okay just for the record we we have processed this before and i have been in conversation with some of the local bankers and that is exactly the right answer is that not many banks in a in the world can handle as much of

a broad spectrum as we have but okay well yeah that is my education here for today the other thing i would like if i may i'd like to add for the last these three items that mr barton is presenting we followed the state's procurement process so it is kind of like with our travel you know for the

last twenty years only one company bids our travel and very few people or companies bid these items but we solicit these proposals in accordance with statute and our local policies and that is what yields what we have before you today anyone else questions comments thank you sir miss jordan group term life insurance good afternoon holly jordan the

chief human resources officer and miss coley mentioned earlier how ctc is a great place for students it is also a great place for employees and one of the things that makes this such a great place for employees is some of our benefits and this is what i want to talk to you about this afternoon and this is

we have been offering the college has been providing life insurance to employees and to a group of retirees since 1970 and this is a request to continue that this would be a new contract a new three-year contract with a new vendor but it is we issued an rfp and we received two responses and this is a request

to continue the coverage let me go over it a little bit with you the life insurance for employees provides insurance up to fifteen their salary up to 150 zero and then accidental death and dismemberment two times their salary up dismemberment two times their salary up to 200 zero that coverage is relatively inexpensive for our employees we have

a group of retirees that we cover and that price tag is a little higher actually three times as much as the actually four times as much as the employees but we do have 222 retirees that are covered on that and we have a very small number of employees that are currently working with this that are eligible to

continue that coverage because before my time in 1993 we realized the retiree coverage was pretty expensive so we stopped it so for many of us in this room we are not eligible for that retiree coverage but there is a few employees that have been with this prior to 93 that will get that upon their retirement the let

me give you a little of the 222 retirees the average age of our retirees is 79 and i do not know if you know that the average life expectancy is 78 so our retirees are doing good that they are enjoying a fruitful retirement so thank you for that h and so i am here today or actually will

be next week to request a new contract with oaks it is a company that we have done a number of references on and the service and the u the coverage is robust so i will come to you next week requesting that the total cost would be a little over 161 zero or a little over 160 we just

carry them and until yes what is the i am sorry what is the amount of coverage that we carry them under they it is their it is one times their annual salary whenever they separated up to a h 100 zero okay because i know the state does it a little bit different well i will tell you what

we implemented u last i guess in 22 was the same age reduction schedule as the state of texas does so as our retirees get older their benefits actually decrease but that is the standard prior in 22 a couple of the insurance providers would not even give us a quote because they said our reduction schedule was ridiculous reduction

schedule was ridiculous so we went with what the state of texas which is five zero so yeah anyone else have questions thank you thank you next item on the agenda is the presentation of a closed circuit hi everyone i am filling in for miss lewis i am melanie bach i am the dean of career and technical instruction

for those of you who are new as you might imagine it is important to have video surveillance of the child development center and for some time our cameras have not been fully functional and so we are requesting to purchase a system that will work not only inside but outside as well on playground equipment and inside where we

can have sound and also the ability to re reverse and see what is happened it is an important thing we have had a couple of instance where we have had strangers outside the fence lobbying we have had a couple of things thrown over the fence so we want to be sure to protect students above all the children

and that is our request i think you will remind us next week about the price you know what it is off hand i believe it is just under 23 zero thank you anyone else questions thank you ma'am thank you next item agenda is appointment of a board member to the ctc foundation board general rever you are representing

the board yes and we have two places so the selection of a second place can i offer this suggestion those of you who are current or new board members if you are interested in being the second board member to serve with the foundation as well give some thought to that and next week as we actually vote on

that issue if somebody steps up to volunteer or if you have questions about what that means you can speak with general weaver after we get through but it is our responsibility and our privilege to have some two members of the board serve on the foundation as well i say one thing about it the the college picks up

the tab for the foundation it is one of those unique things that we have so the college director is a college employee not a foundation employee and the idea there is it gives us more flexibility to give out more scholarships for students and that is what we are here for is to bring in students so an obligation

you have as a as a elected board member to also serve simultaneously on the foundation board is you are expected as an individual to donate one zero a year or arrange to have donate one zero a year or arrange to have one zero one zero donated for your cause now some of you have been on the board

before so you understand what i am talking about it is not cheap but on the other side of the coin it is a dedication that you are willing to serve and you are willing to help the college so just keep that in mind it is all a volunteer you do not get reimbursed for it okay amen that

is where i will ask the chancellor for a memory what was the round number total of scholarships was given out this year through the foundation just over i think it was 300 3004 i was say 316 but it was over 300 zero and if i can plug shamelessly the portal will reopen on june 15th for 30 days

because we have in excess of 100 zero net revenue from our fundraising events good place to put it plug in rex thank you for that yeah next item on the agenda from our attorney miss briggs just to set the story straight for the rest of you that we as a board have decided that we need to go

through our board documents and revise them or at least evaluate them and so we have assigned our attorney to test us or inform us challenge accepted sir so a as you mentioned we will start going through the board policies there are 23 board documents on the website the first thing and you will notice it in this first

one i will go over when you go through those documents they are not all policies some of them are resolutions so for example when you pass the budget or when you pass the tax rate those are done as resolutions and those are not policies that need to be reviewed every in this process so in the sense that

it is a little confusing the way that they look on the website what dr carter and i have spoken about is to divide them into two columns to have policies on one side and resolutions on the other so if anyone has any objections to that let me know but that that is the intent going forward so knowing

that and there are 23 documents listed now we will not review all 23 because the budget document the as i said the tax document you recently passed a document i am sorry a resolution to support the legislative intent of tac that does not need to be reviewed as a policy so the number is a little bit smaller

than we may have originally done but our first adventure in will be two policies i brought for you today and i apologize i am not completely sure what one of the policies looks like in your packet debbie can see it the way i intended it i could not see it the way i intended it which is why

i resent it yesterday hopefully you can see some markup on it if not i am happy to send it again but the first one is policy 370 which is honors and recognitions and this is the policy basically for naming facilities chairs things like that the main change with this is something i just spoke about this was listed

as a resolution but as you read it it is actually a policy so a lot of the formatting changes that i have proposed are changing it from a resolution to an actual standing policy and so where there are now sections that is just the format you have for your board document policies there was also in my in

my review there were some things that the title did not match what was in the paragraph so i have renamed some things just to be consistent that is just a way that i review things you will see that as we go through this process i love to review a document it is my favorite thing in the world

and the laughter will tell you others know it one question for discussion is on the it should be on the second page but it is under section two paragraph b and this is about the requirements for g gift receipt prior to confirming a new facility name and what it says now is that ctc will make no firm

commitment to the naming or even the construction of a new facility until all funds have been raised and or the board of trustees has approved the project the question i wanted to pose to you is whether and or is appropriate so what that means is that the college could commit to naming something before the board has actually

even approved the project with that or in there and so if it said and both of those things would need to happen before you would name a facility and it made a difference in my mind if it does not make a difference to you i am happy to leave it the way it is it makes a difference

it does early in my time on the board we had an issue where a non-board member in well-meaning made a commitment to someone on this particular subject and we as a board were projected to vote to approve it after it had already been committed and i think the funds would already were already provided and i became the

black sheep in the family as i voted no and was criticized that criticism and rolls off my back but was criticized because i had voted against the contributor and that was not my point i was voting because we were violating the policy that we have so i think it makes a difference as well where we or yes

i think in some respect it could feel as though the board's hands are tied because of something that happened before you had an opportunity to even review the project so i can change that to and if everyone agrees i should have started with this as well my intent is to get your feedback today and whatever changes we

talk about today i can bring it back next week for you to approve we will pick up a couple new policies next month and just keep going through that process so if you have any other changes besides something i bring up but other than that almost all formatting changes in that policy and title changes are there any

questions about that policy 370 okay the other policy is this very short one policy 427 on sponsorships and this one used some varying terms and i believe we i changed up some of the terms to be consistent through the policy but the one question on this one is on the second page just before the adopted and approved

language it gives the board the discretion to allocate the 85 of the total dollar amount budgeted for sponsorship and then it says the remaining fifteen may be awarded by the chancellor that leaves a little bit of potential for a gap in funding so if for example the board only allocated 75 the chancellor can only allocate fifteen so

it is not clear what the intent is for that remaining ten if another request came in would the chancellor need to bring that to the board or is it you only go to 75 and you are finished and i do not know that it is happened when we talked about it but it does feel like there is

potential for a little bit of a gap there i read it in my mind i read it as your threshold is 85 that the two numbers are hard numbers so that if the chancellor has met the fifteen and there is and you did not reach your 85 that those requests would be intended to come back to the

board correct that is what i see okay i and i think if i will say if asked today if this situation happened today that is what i would advise the chancellor i think you need to take that to the board so my interpretation would have been that but i am happy to kind of put some language in

there to clear that up but any remaining any unallocated funds originally by the board because the board does them all in one setting typically unless it hits i think is there a five zero do you see a five zero figure in the policy i kind of remember 2500 that is what it is then i bring that to

the board so it there are instances where i would bring something to the board like most recently i brought to you an a usa sponsorship of five zero that is why i remember five zero so anything above that 2500 will be brought back to the board for approval yes and that is already in the policy is there

an annual call for folks to come to us wanting some form of sponsorship yes and that is in here and that is actually one of the changes thank you for reminding me the policy currently says that that they are submitted beginning september 1st and that the proposed list for sponsorships goes to the board for consideration in october

but what has been happening in practice is it is august those come to the board in that is good is there a need to address the gap or no you just think that clears the i think this was more of an opportunity for me to hear what you all think it meant i can i think there is

it hasn't happened so it is not it is not a terribly pressing issue but i think it i can put some yes i can put some language in there understanding if that that is the intent of the board that anything above fifteen is beyond the chancellor's perview that it comes back i can add that language for next

week i can add that language for next week yes i really wanted to hear what your thoughts were on it before i propose some language but i will have it for you in your packet for next week agree and those are the two policies i have any questions well done thank have any questions well done thank you

next item on the agenda is to recommend any topics for upcoming agenda items any topics for upcoming agenda items i just want to say hey to anyone who hadn't applied for a scholarship please apply for a scholarship because it is available also been pushing it hard to bring in more students and i think everyone knows about a

team one team one fight and we got to continue to push forward that is mr manning welcome to the board thank you well this is the time in which you have something to say that you would like for us to know about okay well i'd like to say i am glad to be back on campus so i

spent four years on campus going to ctc and then american technological university and u i want i will not say that every minute and time that i spent on campus was productive but because when my mom would make me go to class on monday and we did not want to go i did spend some monday mornings sleeping

in my car before i went ahead and went to school but anyway it is i have a i have a heart for ctc and during the campaign i talked about making ctc a part of your life and it is been a part of mine and so i look forward to my role here and i am thanking the

voters and also offering the public an opportunity to give us input and also i look forward to being a good pr person for this for this college and and i think i think that is my role and i think i will be glad to tell my story to any student that wants to hear it and i have

already been pitching high school students to stay home stay home for two years and figure out what you want to do at ctc so thank you say thank you to welcome our two new board members and i hope you enjoy it as much as i have enjoyed it and get out and mr brushier yes am i saying

it right yes we are all close enough okay yeah well i thank you all for coming out and seeing me today i appreciate those of you that came by i look to catch up on everything we have going on here and working with the chancellor and doing everything we can to better this place to what full potential

is thank you wonderful thank you eric welcome to our new board members it is a it is a dynamic event here being on the board you get to know a lot of folks and it is a time to relish your opportunities with each other and for the former board members i have developed a great relationship with y'all

and it does not end here we are neighbors we are friends and this is how this board evolves over time and we all get better in the process so thank you all and thank you all welcome to both of you it is a labor of love it requires a lot of thoughtfulness allowing these people to do their

jobs and us to be supportive and we all have one vote that will suffice but i want to say to my colleagues that are that i have worked with all this time i know we are going to be reorganizing the board and i will not be here next week i am going to be out of town but

i want to thank you for your vote of confidence some of you have asked if i am interested i feel like where i am is where i need to be as a secretary i am not interested in moving to another position i learned when i was kissd president for three years i was on the board for eleven

years i learned that in this seat i have more opportunities to be who i am and to say what i need to say and to be true to myself than that chancellor position does i am not interested in changing so i want to say that to my colleagues and to the audience it would not be an oversight

if my colleagues did not if they mentioned me moving to another position or placed me in a position and i am not here would that be a mess but but i just want to say when i was the president of kissd board i never cried so much and prayed as much as i have in a volunteer job

that is a tough job that chancellor position so i am not interested and i can do more good sitting right here in this chair and i will be sitting here in for a little while longer thank you make reference to our attorney is it okay to campaign for position as a board member of the week before we

actually member of the week before we actually vote no thank you secretary may i say to all of you who came today for a special reason that is to affirm the two new candidates you are always welcome and we always have this much fun and we seldom occasionally just because it is more fun we do argue about

some things but as miss kohley has said we are seven independent individual people i just have the loudest voice because of this chair i sit in but i have no more authority no more value than the rest of these in fact sometimes a lot less than the rest of this and so be welcome this is your community

college and we want to serve you who are the taxpayers as well as the students who attend here and with that we are nope sit back down wendy the board meeting next week on the 17th at one p m and then the board workshop for june on the 17th now we are wrong date sir 27th next week

see that is what that is why they like me so much in this job i have always give them something to laugh about as she said
