email that will come to all the point yes the entire board i got just one question in a in a quick announcement i read in the paper but one was about two months ago three months ago i asked for the impact what it would be to raise our minimum pay rate to fourteen an hour we haven't got

anything back yet but i just want to just okay just a reminder okay and then i read in the paper yesterday that there was a ctc graduate that she just got hired on by coer cove is the public relations person so the new hire person but they actually put in her she is a graduate of central texas

college name anna rodriguez oh nice that is cool little recommend little kudos for ctc great thank you sir do you want to say anything about the sure i forgot to ask dr walker about her about this in her time so i am giving her a moment okay sure last last week we received i believe was all public

institutions of higher education received a letter from governor abbott it is the letter that i actually emailed to you all last week and but we believe that letter was intended for the general academic institution systems and so i had miss briggs take a look at that to research it because the way the letter read it sounded as

if we were prohibited from increasing tuition when in all actuality that was that guidance was in house bill one which was a general appropriations bill for the for the state so miss bricks can you share a little more about that yes there was there was a compromise sort of issue requested by the chancellors of the systems that

if they were given additional funding they would freeze tuition that was before the legislature started and so house bill one is the en appropriations bill so technically central texas college is in there but the section that talks about the the tuition frees is only specific to the general academic institutions the systems the big system is to me

but general academic institutions if you go back probably a good twenty or 30 pages in the bill that is defined as specific campuses but they are all the system campuses and so in my reading of it does not apply to community colleges or any college that is not in one of the systems the transmittal letter it the

transmittal email itself referenced the the heads of those systems so we just got caught up in the distribution what we believe that brings up a point though should we ask for a ruling from the attorney journal as whether or not it applies to us i do not want to go through a lawsuit somebody su tuition we have

got it programmed in yeah our tac legislative arm is they are in agreement but they are also they are headed to the state well they were at texas pathways last week but they are approaching the governor's office to get clarification to make sure that we are okay i started an email response to you asking you to do

that yesterday and i deleted it i thought i was overstepping so no we i we did that that is as a matter of fact i called the day i got the letter and and i also reached out to our representative remind you that we have a board meeting scheduled december 17th and a board workshop in january of

2025 is there a motion to adjourn so move so move motion been made and second much yall have good thanksgiving you too
