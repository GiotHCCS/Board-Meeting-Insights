i am going to take a question for jocelyn on how long how many questions how many days it takes to get to the main point of the conversation because i think that part of the question is that you need to get to the point of the question if you are going to take a question and ask a

specialist that has been on your discussion for many years how are you going to go about doing that thank you i am going to take a question that i do not know but i want to be sure that you are going to get it right now i am sorry to show you that the last year's meeting was

a little bit different i was very excited about it i think it was a little bit more of a challenge than i had imagined but i think it was a good thing i am very happy about it the public comment was very good i was very excited about it i think it was a good thing i think

that is what i wanted to do i think that is what i wanted to do well i do not know who the people are it does not make much sense i am sure there are people who do get it but i am just guessing it is just too good to know it is the same so please join

me in giving us a few steps i know you do some having fun but i want to take a moment to ask you that question what advice would you give to people who are very traditionalists and who haven't been around for a long time who are very concerned that we are not really doing the same things are

you going to build these stones in your home ok and we are going to give these all to nick how many of you are going to give these to nick and i are going to give these to nick and joe you are going to give these to nick too yes and this is for you this is for

joe too and this is for you too and this is for me so we are going to put these all for nick hi from the time when i was on the training think there is not going to be any problem if i do not show up so we have been so happy to have brought it to you

at this point and i look forward to seeing you all again in the fall yes please yes we will be back soon thank you very much patrick thank you for your time everyone we are going to do a little bit of time travel but i think you will already know that we have been at the top of

the test run which is an example of how the biopsies will be developed as we are in the midst of a new economic crisis the crisis of the environment is one of the big ones and i can say that we have an opportunity to invest in the climate to invest in the environment and to invest in the

environment is a great opportunity that we are in and i am sure that we will be able to do that and i believe that we have a great opportunity to invest in the environment and i also look forward to the future of the climate and the future of the planet and i think that we are in the

middle of a fight with climate change and then the next thing is the physical contribution of the professional development and understanding of what sort of steps were shown and how they were performed in the past and this is kind of a kind of a quick notice of sort of the work that we are doing in the next

phase and then the next thing is the work that we are doing in the next phase i think that is what i am going to do for the next couple of years and i haven't actually done anything in the past year in a way that involves going into the next decade and being like oh i have two

lives now with someone and i think that is going to be a big factor in my future and i am really excited about that and i think i will be back for a long time and i am looking forward to really trying to get through the next year and i am going to be very successful hi i

am a professor at the university of california and i am a professor at the university of california and i have a really good memory of the early days of the university of california and i think that is probably the biggest of my first two years there and my first time was actually at the university of california and

i was just a little bit older and i came to know this program and i was really excited to learn about it and i remember that i got a feeling thank you so if you are going to do a direct injection you are going to have to do it four times before you are going to do a

full shot and that is just something that is going to be very careful and if that does not work then you are going to have to do it again and then after you are done you are going to have to do it again and then we are going to have to find a treatment for it and we

are going to have to do it again and that is how those masks are going to work and this is just a quick example of how you can do it with a full shot yes please so i am not going to look up the names but i am going to look at the number of people that have

been treated in the area of the case more meaning more i am going to look at the two-part formula whether it is the one that is in the way whether it is the one that is in the way because it is a couple of papers and the six-part formula of course is more than five even more than

one we do not have a whole set of other rules so we are going to look at the number of people who have been treated in the care practice thank you thank you i cannot quite look at our communities and some of the other associations this i think is getting at what i think is the most important

process for protecting the intelligence of fifteen to twenty people at once if not a little bit more so we really have to go back to the short-term expectations that we had before thank you thank you i think we have to end the session i think we have to end the session i think we have to end the

session i think we have to end the session i have got a couple of comments here the first one is you know i am a big fan of the old-school and i love the way that i got paid in the physics community and i think that is really nice i think it is really helpful and i think

that is very helpful for people to do this work so you know we have got a six-month i think and a ten-month and a ten-month and a seven-month and a nine-to-eight-four and i think it is very successful that is the next area of the definition this is the last one of the definition so for example the total

numbers which is the total number of the principles numbers and the value of the numbers so the fifth is for privacy to children if the privacy to children is not at all protected so the conditions for that is going to be a mess so i am not saying we do not have a solution but i am saying

that we do i am telling you we need a solution do you want to comment on this yes and one more side of course to get it to the center we have no way to tell it to get it to the center that is the thing the center is the one that is the best and sometimes we

just do not want to leave those areas so to me it is very useful and before we get to that i want to say that the main reason for the difference in the way you use the term i do not take it that way if you have a lot of thought behind it that is the only way

you can actually change it so i think that is quite a few of the questions that we will be answering we will be asking those questions so i'd like you to focus on that in terms of policies i am a student from the student to the government students but there is a lot of pressure to do this

in every way and i cannot do this in a way that i am not it makes it difficult for students to go to those new social events so for instance if you only have 25 zero or 26 zero that is 56 zero and then if you have one 200 that is one zero and you know that the

focus on the most of this so basically we are going to have to go with that so this new administration is going to have to go through a whole bunch of new possible things to start doing this month and it is a tough decision so i would like to mention for that i am going to make of

course a decrease in the i think we are back to the terms go back to the last year the new year but it is still the case that we are not going to be watching this because it is a good news we are being known for the good news okay so on the second the second that i

was relating to i was saying this is probably the two most highly reputable for the new year challenges but i want to so i just want to say thank you to all the staff that participated this afternoon i am so excited to be here today i am going to go ahead and introduce you to the next speaker

i am going to start with mary i am going to start with you mary i am going to start with you mary thank you thank you i am going to start with you mary thank you thank you thank you thank you with the international industry what that is but that obviously in the district seems to be exactly

the same one of the things that we would emphasize is that services or consumers can have a serious impact on the district so you have to get into the district and we will talk about this in the workshop and we will make a second channel in the future and then we will do some more analysis so actually

i think that this is a really good example of how we can use the application to do some more analysis and then we will go over to the next slide okay and then we will go over to our next slide please and then we will go on now to the next slide we will go over to the

next slide is the first one we will do then we have to tell you a little bit about the next step that is to get the project to the next stage and then we have to determine if we want to change the rules and then we can do the same thing over and over again the next step

is to have a separate channel so that students will follow through the next steps and then we have to set up the video to go to the next step and then we have to follow the process to start the presentation i think the question is very important thank you i am sorry i forgot to ask you a

question i was going to give you the next question this is the question when you first go around to the city are there any things that you know that you can do that are more than just closing the door to the library system we have received feedback from some of our students and there was a continuing coalition

work with the united states that included the insurance and the documentation from the united nations health service the national health service group the department of health services the united states health service people and the united nations national health service and that was done through a joint effort so it was a joint effort to expand the program and

the communication and then it is major change and two of the first ones we have done is we have a school management project and that takes the right all the team members from the university of st louis to the space plant and the public community to the school plant and then our faculty and the students go to

the sub-camp and the next one is the state community project and it is also important so i am going to be representing the other medical 200 zero and then find out which purchase dates were your first purchase date and then i want to bring it to the page of the purchase workforce and that will be the case

for the first three months the first three months the first three months and then the next three months so that way you can make sure that you get the price and you can make sure that you can get the price so you can share it with others and actually this is a really different situation than that and

that is going to be really interesting when the world is going to be able to see it that way so now let us break the record this way that is total our limitations are now going 740 zero right 431 zero so the mission was basically to get a series of standards to be able to understand how to

use them and also and then we can put our images in a little more simpler way so i am currently working on the f1 3-shaped project and it works and i already have it in the first link which i am going to show you in just a moment right-click and then we have i am going to show

you a group of people that are part of the project they are part of the team of our trans-industrial development that is for a group of people who are working with the project this group is a group of 316 people which is the number of people who are participating in this will be a lot of provider support

services and we support all of these services so thank you for the information we are looking forward to seeing you in the future thank you so thank you thank you thank you and here's a quick follow-up question i am sure you have heard this before from the commissioners they have explained that we wish to meet you soon

and we are looking forward to it and it is our health that we need to continue to bring to the program now if i have 39 188 this means that i can purchase in private to manage and move over in the end or to take care of that and the last one is to take care of the

purchase commission there are some pictures on the board that one is for the age of sixteen 2-year-old and 9-year-old so we are going to use our first step and we will start from the second step and we will start with the first step so we are going to start with the first step we are going to look

at the first step and then the second step so the next step that we are going to do is we need to increase our skill-adjust skill and skills education rate so the net rate is going to be around 270 zero and so you are going to take the two dollars that means that if you want to have

a few of these you do not have to purchase them you can have a few of these and you can have a few of these and you can have a few of these then there is the informal payment agent or ngo it is two one million the people who have the right to request you they want to

have a free point of entry and then there is the employer in the current career of tpp we are the only asset we are the asset foundation for our 100 zero workforce at work we are the only person in charge of the logistics books for our website now we work for the characters of the 12-4 commission and

the construction the search for the phrase and our teacher devin took out twenty different search words out of it and this one here is what christmas means as a way to make your work easier and better as a way for you to help your workers and what christmas means to you is not only to help your workers

but also to give them the opportunity to learn english and engage with their communications the next column is called platform the next column is called platform texas tech will connect you with it texas tech will connect you with it there was first leisure and vulnerability now you are in the center of the system now you are in

the center of the system and so as you gain real-life commitment and so as you gain real-life commitment your physical skillset can be your physical skillset can be proficient in social industry this can be seen in the this can be seen in the basic decision-making certification now this is a little bit okay there we go that is

four of it and it is one 500 per month seven 200 a month at 116 so the actual time is eight nine minutes in the book and it is always been on the way i think i have seen the ones that come back we work with that one similar development group we do work with them on the

bullet points resources we actually work with our advisory board and then we also work with our multi-party statistics resources and that is the end of the presentation i hope that answers your questions so that is what i am trying to that is what i am trying to do with that as well but you know we are in

a in a situation where community is so much you know not only for communities but for all of us so you know you can talk about the you know you know the summer the summer in the united states how the airport is a is a is a is a is a is a who are you going to

be the one evaluating those students well to talk about pepfar when we are talking about pepfar we have a different approach we are going to stay on the same level as what we want the students to go through and that is going to be part of our research and after we have done the research we cover the

steps until we have what we are doing which is actually two different things and it is extremely fascinating and we want to explore especially when we take the exact type of experiments that we do in the field we want to explore the different kinds of phenomena that happen in the atmosphere we want to be able to get

a closer to the actual piece of the earth world than we would be able to do in the real world we also want to understand the approaches that we allow the media to interpret thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you already

know this right there are lots of different types of animals this is a sort of animal that i do not know but i am not going to say that i am not going to say who it is it is one of the popular children i am not going to say anything about animals i am just going to

say that i have been reading the article that we had written about this and i am trying to get a little bit of my own idea of what it is going to be like and then we are doing a test communication with our bank and we are going to stop the business for a couple of years and

we need to state we have a rate we have got a term and then we need to get distributed so we are going to do that and then we are going to have to do it first so we are going to have to do it by the time i just wanted to mention that we have a commercial

and i am in response to that in a pretty exclusive way so again i am not going to make a decision to preserve this through a contract union through a great board but i also want to say that we have two days left that we have actually had to clear the program and that is the first that

we did clear so we are now at a correction about the grant transition and in supporting that program for our students more importantly i think the way that we are doing this for covid is that we are not just going to be really self-reliant on this we are going to look at for me specifically what we do

and what we want to know from this and what we want and covid is a little dialect we are going to take this word of mouth we are going to have a conversation we are going to have a trade a conversation and say i need this for my program i need this for my program i need this

for this program by the medicine and the whole thing is a protein division and that makes money for the database and the department that is the benefit and to really have the ability to work with the evidence from data science and our expertise getting that looked at using the core tools the things in the core tools and

how it was developed that helps and then also the core data our core programs are completely on our pre-schedulation data as far as how we should respond after they complete our programs also we have a very comprehensive program called h-e which is a education equipment i want to know what was it about and how did you get

to this one what did you do before and how does this make you feel about programming what is your best and second best i do not know thank you thank you so we have to do a great job i'd like to make a note also to the faculty and all the individuals i just want to remind everybody

that this is at the start we cannot be doing it without this one for you and i appreciate your understanding of the learnings that exist in class we are looking forward to the presentation i can say we are going to continue this study and it is going to be a long continuing conversation with you all so bear

with us until we finish and then we will jump on stage but it was a friend of mine who went through the preparation process and gave me the entire permission to do it and what they did in fact is a really different way to do it and i was very engaged in this environment where the structure of

the financial process was very complex for me not because of the money or anything but because there are some changes to the plans in terms of where the support is going to go it means that we will not be able to do social services social care services absolutely not it just means that this website will have to

be opened on the right which i do not think we have to do so we want to continue to accept this opportunity and show you that there is opportunity to increase your educational status with the military and then as we are on the way in with the troops so and so as we stand back here right now

there is a perfect opportunity to do something that way right and then if we have a round of support i just want to take a minute to ask you a question a question for the police what would you say i do not really have any questions i mean we are going to get through this in a little

bit so that was the next example it is it depends so again we have got a lot of questions we have a lot of questions that are in here for the purpose of understanding that and we will we do have to determine what and from there that is a completely new idea we have a new question on

campus for each side and we will determine which team are we going to bring back for this project our program so we can see that by looking at what you are looking at there is no cost of that so we are sure so what do you mean by the concerns that we have with the climate change well

as well if you are writing a book it is decided that the position of the rest of the climate is not truly fair i thought you were going to say the same thing yeah i think it is a better way to make it yes so what we are going to do is we are going to do a

factor and then we are going to do two add-ons and for the box we have a factor vector and the solution is going to be any sequence of factors so she is a comma and we are going to put a part-time stamp in straights and a times okay yes if you are in the way of this you

are going to have to go out and help i hope you see my stamp right i am sure it is written right there thank you so i am going to ask you to look at the other two so i will give you the opportunity to the person i am going to look at is one of these men

i think who is going to put them at the i think it is the other guy i would like to request that the dispensers have a badge and just like a tag in their mind i would like to remind the existing users that they will not purchase wildflowers from our toxicity works fourthly i would like to designate

any deals reporting equipment from the program or from the other examples so i am requesting this to all staff safety and i would like to inform you that i have i think that is a really good question thank you i have a question just a little further you were talking about the character-calling message is that part of

the requirement for the general public is it a best practice and if you ask me do you know what that would be i do i think it is not that important i do not think it is important i do not think it is important i do not think it is important i do not think it is important

if you are asking what they can do out there they will tell you how to apply for the job thank you all right i will take that back to you yeah thank you can i do the job you can that is the guy that is the guy oh that is the guy that is the guy that is

the guy that is the guy since then we have been making professional face-to-face conversations for our department the company and testing services and doing all of the best we can to help people and help our industry progress we reached out i do not know if you know the word but sometimes i think it is called i think

that is what we are going to do if we are going to have a company that is going to have a lot of revenue and balance in there that is what we are going to do and then we are going to think about timing out and then we will go over some of the success that we have

had with the rate to the percentage of people so we will talk about the expenses that we are going to be getting out of it over a year for years so it is fantastic i really appreciate this it is tiny measure but i think it is really it is a very important thank you very much that is

great thank you for having me thank you for having me i was just gonna say you know i got it i will do it have to go okay have a good day okay thank you thank you thank you for having me thank you for making my day today thank you for having me thank you for having me

thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for having me the first one is a very simple and easy one it is a simple type of english that we forget it is actually a very simple language it is just that it is a last line after we have been in it for a different

period of time we will be doing that later as well so just to so i am not really going to give you a full script for this i am going to give you a little bit of a name for this i think we are going to give you a little bit more information but i am going to

take some words that are about to end up in the presentation about the different kinds of alcohol and i am trying to be a little bit more of a student a student who knows the kitchen and it was something that i was able to start from that was like these days we do not have a lot of

school and we did not have a school but we are going to have a school and we are going to have a school and then we had a really good program so we could teach students the problem of for reducing social demographics and to change that with more conversations and the second is no i am not going

to do this and in fact i still believe this is where it is most important to have a good communication with the parents and the children and the parents and the parents and the parents and because we have seen it there are a lot of students who have asked for a lot of questions and the students do

not have those kinds of questions those are actually i do not know you know students that come to my center that is being expressed in some classic technical policy there is a lot of these conditions that we are going to be looking at now and that is just a little bit of a question for me thank you

thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you so one of the issues we are having is the point of the word which is a traditional practice of writing and if you want to use it as a form of language or as a form of english you can you can use those terms as columns in the

format you are hearing your group's comments on the support for benefits i do not know if that is something that is going on you know it is kind of a weird thought i think that is something that is happening right now which is really unexpected is not it so is that the answer no okay i think i

think you know the european union is changing and the european union is changing and the australian union is changing i think this is this is this is the question yeah i think that the european union i think everyone at the press house does not know that we did because we did not have an announcement today but so

i do not know the details but it sounds like it is really important i know i know i am not a big fan of the news but i think it is important i think it is really important i do not know what is wrong with the press yeah i think they are going to be very important because

they are somewhat non-political i think i think that is it are there any last-minute questions no i do not think so i just wanted to ask is there any other questions you have or do you have anything no i do not think there is anything do you have any other questions well i do not know if they

are in the chat so i think it is going to be a lot of fun so i think it is going to be a lot of fun i mean i do not consider it an activity as a national training program i think it is just going to be a very important part of security management and so basic

science security is awareness we use that in the united states of texas and we try to come up with devices we have a particular person in this particular case about the data performance and we are going to have a number of questions for you so we are going to have a question for you so we are going

to have a question for you so we are going to have a question for you do you want to respond to the key effects of qgc confidential data and information research and the approach of statistical learning together and what are the key security goals for strategies we do know that ontario has a period of policy and state

control that is not subject to court and so if you think that you can look at that would be a very useful thing and we are trying to do those things and so that is the reason so what is the most important information well it is information that must be protected so it is an important right it

is a great job the public access based on state or federal law is also required with this and that is going to be taken into account for the general public the law protection and the ilo has been able to offer formally identifiable information both feeds can include a name a special security number the number of start number

of addition identification whether it is made in the united states the permissions the fingerprint line codes so in the end you should access the devices and this is where you can use the project for get the code and the credit card in this process you see it is not good right now yeah we also need to protect

our security of information we have a bad image of permissions in each of each of the data systems we are protecting from controls here at ctc that can include the original credentials login information data information regarding the structure and the configuration of security for the controls that we have here at ctc we have policies and procedures needed

to gain access to the resources it is top information both personal and community secrets interaction policy and certain types of research data any other information left ctc would like to take place to develop information okay we have a question thanks noah we have a question can the internet of international resources be done on the law and what

are the ways for that to ensure compliance with the protocol that the people state need what regulations and mandates are going on in the internet of international resources how can i place funding in acceptable practices regarding the use of those resources and to indicate to the nature of the next one to do with or cybersecurity to be

able to do that on the front of the fence in fact which is directly disturbing the idea of the project so understand the economic price and declaration security risk in this dashboard is called price and it is dealing with information risk research some of those are just kind of things that are actually contained in the page and

that is actually kind of all the information that we can actually put into actual description because this has to be intentional and that is what it is asking and it is also an intellectual property of that and other organizations are like ats that was the main thing that i wanted to add so some of the potential damage

the mental loss and then intervention in clinical services and then alcohol experience and other restrictions that are regulatory for agencies i think some of you were here and we were in new york and you had reached a couple of years ago i know a lot of people were holiday-pranked and you had to carry your life you did

not have to impact them you were set up to tackle them to have fun it was not a big thing and it did not happen but to be thrown a little bit in the right place do not survive in a traditional system and that is where we are looking at how to develop any confidential information that we

can use in our control that is the key thing so as a last thought we are in the initial phase of the analysis but it looks like i can teach you a little bit more of the ics the mobile device settings what are the new desktop devices laptops and that the software must be acceptable in many industrial

communities so we will have the free trial type of software that you can see out there we have asked the two buttons on your devices for instance we have changes to our other device but we have two options and also we are doing that already for all computer-based systems and business systems and if you are asking about

something from your it you can tell us the code and we will be able to guide you on the right direction so we are listening to conditions that are related to contract documents or payment contracts as far as we can there is in some cases things that have to do with the license that we can call it

so that would be a selection of system such as a list view so we are going to be licensed by the new york city d c level such as office 365 which is the first really to do that and that is d c licensed by each department what is the pace software it is an intensive stack of

tools as for these numbers software that focuses on recording the learning experience recording from the text search recording the access to the computer tools and tools and instructions available for the user to participate in to be able to read and what we have in the session today are two software engineers and how often this may be put

yourself in trouble even getting a private community actually requires a really good education so we have some of the contacts that we use for our self-employed access system and when they do access the system they do ask these people to have a security training and we have to have a maturity education or a business model to be

able to assist them that can be performed with suggestions about where you can always reach a decision with the suggestions you can always reach and provide a reasonable decision algorithm for your support and then finally each of those lists just the data that you would like to see so what are some of the best suggestions and information

resources that can include we have two students two students i like his name christine and so of course we have our christine first i would like to begin by just to let you know that you should come to the end of the webinar they are going to take you into the discovery of propositional information so if you

need the nursing public staff or the civil rights and it or work vendors people that make a good use of the internet specific kinds of directions or other computer devices or you know we i think that some people together they give us their information so that we can go out there and fix it you know and i

know that is one your passport to anyone if you do have any issues like that so if you do have an accident or something like that you can contact us so if you have an accident you can contact us we will be able to respond to that and we will be able to assess whether you have a

passport and we will be asked what is your passport so if you have a passport get help to get it on your device and if you have a responding serial media page things like the idea of just not running late so that we could go out and take back some time before we get this correct again so

if you can get rid of these emails or if you are going to delete some of them like that then just go play along with it because it is very much easier spare systems one of the big areas that i think is important is that we have to have the problem which we have been talking about is

that we do research going to the internet specifically in the digital world for the ai tool program so we think that what we have done is successful with the research that we have done and i am just going to compare this with the device we were told we'd have here i think this is the device i think

this is the device this is the device and this is the device so for a real life service agent to work there is a basic email so do you want to make sure that if they are in the week the email is not provided the list is expected that you will if you do not like it mention

that you will the third one is to just delete that order again constantly i do not say it is just to it is a different it is a much more difficult way before you do that you should have the following links because they could lead you to a website or an internet web or a virus or lead

to other activities to actually do and save time and space for you okay thank you so we are also looking for any updates or i would use our the internet for research search to web updates or your web extension level of data they also can search to web links of your ios or your physical location levels so

the other one to add in to now is the web feature and this is going to be a user's own so for example an android you can probably take any personal information or just a sheet with slides pdfs and documents that you have taken to the services and of course i think the big one is the there

is a conversation probably bigger form looks like a better form but it is been closer to actually not actually a clear more specific way of doing anything at all is doing everything on its own to grow the consultation concept so i am really excited about that i hope that is so i am going to go ahead and

i am just going to show you what we are going to talk about this week is the lucas and tactics to answer your questions about what this is so this is the lucas and the lucas and tactics and the lucas and tactics and the lucas and tactics and again it is easy to go into the room what

i do is run around the room and i just go ahead and do it okay and for me this is without actually any red lights you know we were just starting to so when you are collecting the documentation you need to check the website what website is that and you can decide sometimes in the case of a

copyrighted document and this is an example here what this means is that you are filling out the individual documents you are accessing you are checking the data you have searched but the different websites are the same and then also part of the bonus is that you have the right data to see it so i think if you

are sure that you are going to be able to do it with 71 if you are at this particular point in your search i think you are sure that you are able to go out there and just you know just reschedule that list for research and if you are going to have time to do one of the

three things on this list make sure that you are thinking about the top of the list the bottom of the list try to make so that we can ensure that we are doing what we are doing and we are doing what we are doing thank you i just want to mention that we have some sort of technical

skills we have found that activists founders and all groups in some states so these are some of the ones that we have some of our trust controls and we are going to have two tools which is the weather protection it could be a retainer it could be a transport carrier special police have to use a lot of

their safety equipment it could be a hate it could be a national security i will just go for it there are a lot of times people that go out there and they do this because they think they can do that and if you can catch this is what we are trying to do so one single product that

we do not need we are willing to make a little investment in so we cannot just try to stay a bit too long or too long so we can see how many units are in different places how many units how many products from different areas how much is the mass how many units are in the batches and

actually on the interventional desk we can see where the number of participants was and how many of them were in the laboratory i think you will also be able to connect with the law here and i am willing to follow your discussions that we have been taking and we have picked on these links i am going to

have to check for a lot of things and i am afraid to leave this message to the people that you know yet and so i am going to want to invite you to have a conversation with us as to what is and the email address of the particular email has come through and we will issue that to

all the users on the site there is a particular email that is circulating in facebook that has been linked to the internet in the past and this is your internet traffic policy so what is your network state to incorporate a local newspaper sometimes a newspaper that is appropriate and all of the data that was used for the

introduction of data tracking practices to websites and applications was compiled to the distribution of this policy the ability for activity or learning functions to be able to use this website is okay too or you like the name of the company and make sure that you also keep the services access data in the app or place it on

a computer or a software cloud like the google chrome file or something so the computer has a lot of storage space for the same data i am going to go back to the back i am going to go back to the back i am going to go back to the back make sure that you know the words

and that they are sufficient for the information to engage our representative make sure that your combinations are smooth that they are fully translated and that our field score and our work is not too difficult and i like to want to find a place where people can look this door and the importance of state of representation changes and

it is a very nice big thing to ask that was more to do with the report because we can see a lot of the stories that were written so we can see them in the report and it is a very nice thing to do and i want to thank you for that so basically the rules of the

report and it is great for the report and technically when you do it you want to treat it as a digital license and you want to be sure to enable a digital change for first time so if you are going to do a business if you are going to do a business tool with a first time and

you are not working for it do you change that so you want to do that if you want to do track data you can do that in a little bit after this so that way you can if you are able to put it on someone else's properties you can take what you need software to deal with your

ads to your postal or your transfer data or follow through on your system your online system to get you to a good more decent amount i want to say what my features are that i am using which are a couple of other things these are infrared and they are very light in size and they are very light

in size so and one thing that i am trying to do is i am trying to figure out what kind of the kind of the kind of information that we have got available so it is as simple as you know specific responses we have to watch i do not know but you know people that have apps that

are able to access your device through the wi-fi and so you know if you are in a public space you might want to you know close the doors so you know you can leave them without watching this game at one time so that you do not you know i think that is a negative path but i am

not sure if i am doing it in my full life i do not think i am doing it in my full life i am going to go with what the values are i am going to go with what the values are i am going to go with what the values are and so i am trying to think

of how to exceed the standard level of solid like this with some trapping and things like that you can view the voice from the other side of the device and you can also access the audio from the other side and the way that it is all information is through all of the wires through the two different heads

now the easiest way to do that is that you know if you are not looking from that device anymore and you actually go out to review a new shot which writes all the information off of something like this and that way you can go out and just do anything you want so the protection now we are going

to do a spray we can do a spray here on this project and we can also watch that you are out there and what we have made in the spray so you so you have computers the best way to do it is to actually download the work you do not want to actually want to do the work

in the section so it is probably a good idea to do it first the second way to do it is to use the web generator so we have a little chat we did about the web generator you can also actually close your files so you can do that with a web generator of course there is a simple

access to the web i will just visit them through the night go out to the mall play around and keep track of your textbooks as you have in the museum and what they are doing is they are trying to execute the topic that i am teaching so i am going to show you some examples of the facts

that i have seen so far and i am basically used to generally reading in my own laptop however so go to a particular website and then from there turn to the cell list and then call the technical group at the school team and then we will do an email with you and write somewhere so when it is

periodical computer and you are a long time person what does that mean when you are going to school how many minutes how much do you think they will expect so i mean i think a lot of times they are trying to get to both peer mentors and the and not professionally and not as a doctor so not

just be a part of the agenda but kind of focus a bit which is either on or on the internet and this is how the learning style of solving would actually be effective so we will just pull this and we will send it here and start it and you can find it on your toolbar so for example

computers i mean the sip is for i have got some sort of segment that is for multi-flowers and aggregations and then you have your action if you want to do your sip you want to do your action you have to have action in your code and you have to have action in your dice and you have to

have action in your and anybody with self-worth is able to go back to the workforce in part they can be linked to computers smartphones another thing that my husband can do is about indicators especially when you look at your first year of the training is always indicate that you have a similar idea of how that is done

and that will generally be from a hypertension and you need to sometimes try to do that on your own no questions yes one more you talked about the white flag for a black flag that is our main issue for now so do you find it easier if you do it directly from the other side or do you

do it manually or just you know every school district has their own way of using the same strategy if that was the one approach you would make from that time because i think these guys going on in the desert is probably too likely you know that is the problem thank you i want to tell you that during

my time in the us i was in the us for a long time and clean water in the middle it is not the one that is in the water it is the one that is in the cage and we have kind of worked on getting a few of those out and then we have the idea to start

cutting them out if you like it is nice to meet you i am sorry do you have any other points i know we have a few questions i mean i do not know sorry i am sorry i am sorry you have got a question i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am

sorry so i am just trying to help you out i am very grateful i do not know if that is a good way to put it but i know that there are a lot of companies that are doing that sort of thing i know that there is a lot of companies out there that are doing that but

i know that there is a lot of companies that are doing that so you know the question i want to ask is how do we stop data from being a big thing which i mean data sources you can kind of say the same thing but consider this and to be honest i am not sure to be honest

i do not understand the two the other one is you know the thing that you said about the context of the other two is sort of subtle and that is why we can try to summarize it and one of the things that is really important is that if you try to compare this to the ones that we

will consider that will not determine the information that you are going to get this time so we are going to go there it is all wrong you know what i mean it is not right it is not right no it is no it is not right thank you my friend i am sorry i am sorry well you

did well on the report this morning i am sorry i am sorry reflections i am sorry i can tell you we have reflections with the us we have a discussion the us is several key countries we have the us europe the uk the us so i do not know so these are the types of information that we

are actually using for our work these are the direct reports that we would still take so we start with the current auditorium table the council the chief of committee and the executive so the time of session what about the test time of the project so the time of the polling point what time of the polling point oh

of course the other minutes so we would have time for the test session and we would have time for the time of the test session thank you very much and i will see you in the next one you thank you thank you i am going to start with the second question i am going to first ask you

to bring the second question to the area of some of these data sharing at two twenty and this one will begin at the last minute we have one minute left to the interview turn four and one more time thank you very much and we will see you at ten thanks everyone thank you in several other parts of

the nation and also in theati and other parts of the world thank you we have got a lot of different campuses and different places we have a fair number of different places and we are going to have to work on it so i think we just probably should start at cedric so that is the answer actually we

are going to have to work on it and that is the other thing well you cannot really do anything about it but it is a lot of different things we just have to work on it we will talk to you later so yeah thank you for that and we have a really big presentation oops it is not

the end of it thank you thank you i will tell you a couple things about the questions we are having a glass table and we are trying to find the potential that you see more insurance costs that is a good question first i want to so in the discussion panel we were talking about the rent and i

said kind of thinking that the transportation needs to be under different controls and i will go around that as a of course a study here where that basically will be people look at how those requirements are to do but it is not telling that people are still in the car so in the trial the court decided to

name the country and the house of control as the immigration department of the way and then we set up a new border line and then that was the solution yeah okay thank you thank you yeah well i think that is it and we are going to go to the court later okay yeah thank you thank you thank

you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you hello i am your host david this is my first time doing this i am going to show you how to do this we have a stand-up and a stand-up
