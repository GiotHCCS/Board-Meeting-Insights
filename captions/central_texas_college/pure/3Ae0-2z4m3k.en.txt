i wrote it i want yall to know good afternoon to h chancellor dr michelle carter vice chancellors the ctc board members it is my pleasure to stand before you today to say thank you for the promotion given to me as department chair for the computer information technology and systems department i consider it an honor and a privilege

to serve as a leader of this great college when i started here in january of 2014 i wanted to spread my knowledge and skills to others to help them achieve their goals the first graduation i attended in 2014 i was so excited to watch some of my students because i consider them my students and so i was

like i am so excited to watch them walk across that stage and i and to know that i played a part a valuable part in their education that motivated me to do more and to continue pouring into my students i have thoroughly enjoyed working at ctc and i cannot wait to embark on this new adventure as department

chair our previous department chair dr oser was a great example and i intend to continue the reputation she is built for our department we are family and i will continue to keep that sense of family and support for each other our department will work hard to be on the cutting edge of technology and bring the best education

to each and every one of our students that walk through our classroom doors so with that being said i want to personally thank everyone that took part in preparing me for this took part in preparing me for this position chancellor dr michelle carter board members some of you have no idea but i have watched you i have

watched your leadership skills and how you stood tall in your beliefs that ctc will be the college that provides accessible equitable and quality educational opportunities that promote student success completion and employability to all of our students whether near or far so i want to say again thank you for the opportunity to be a vital part of the

we are when last year i i spoke to the faculty and i shared with them that i was willing to come to their classrooms if they invited me miss martin invited me and i attended one of her classes and it is it was a class i do not remember the name of the class but there were adult

learners and dual credit students remember we have always told you that with early college high school and the stem program they are all together there are no cohorts and i watched her manage this very diverse classroom generational diversity if you will and she was amazing the students had no idea who i was sitting in the corner so

what i got to see was genuine it was very authentic and the students were really enjoying the lesson and the activities so thank you miss martin for that next four technicians of tomorrow you all remember a few years ago we partnered with transition assistance services to stand up the four technicians of tomorrow program unfortunately the it is

a wonderful program but as with any contract you know we are not in it to lose money and so there were some minimum student numbers that we needed to achieve for each cohort and it was difficult for our partner to maintain th those recruitment numbers and so we were not covering all of our costs and so we

after some conversations it was determined that we would end the contract we both agreed also the this is a this is a transition program one of the transition programs on for cazos of course we provide the instruction on our campus but another issue for the program is that general motors has a program on fort cabazo and it

is free so those same soldiers are eligible for that program and it is difficult to compete with free sometimes to compete with free sometimes right business resource center mou earlier this month earlier this fiscal year when you approved your sponsorship allocations the business resource center the 30 zero allocation was included well the con the theou ends in

january and in the last several years we have always renewed it well after evalu val ating the performance this year we have decided all three entities the chamber as well as the workforce solutions we have collectively decided not to renew the contract we pay you will recall we pay 330 zero and each of them pays 35 zero

in the chamber actually hires the employees however i will tell you that we are all committed though to continuing with support to small businesses and entrepreneurs it will just it will look different so those are the conversations that we are having right now the chamers taking the lead on that so it is not that the support is

going away it is the structure in which we do it so also to let you know the we made an initial payment of fifteen zero not a full 30 zero so we still have the other half prison education program so the half prison education program so the administration we are currently pursuing the designation of our gatesville prison

program as a department of education prison education program and if approved individuals incarcerated at this location who meet certain criteria of course will be eligible for pale funding pel grant funding and that is huge so at this time i'd like for dr garrett to come forward and just talk about our progression through this process and what the

next steps are thank you dr carter the to get approval with the department of ed to offer courses funded through pel has been a long process and we are almost to the finish line with it we had to get approval and get letters of support from the actual prison system we had to get sachs approval which was

quite a hall to their credit they wanted to be sure that what we submit to the department of ed for pel approval was very accurate to the point where if i left off an s with on something we had to resubmit so it was it was quite a hall getting that approved but i am happy to say

that we did receive approval from sachs for all four locations and the programs that were request were requested by the gates prison system so that we should be able to offer those through pel once now we get approval from the department of ed so that is the next step my financial aid team is working on the application

right now what it amounts to is getting approval since we as an institution are allowed to offer pel it is a matter of getting approval for those loca those four locations and the degrees that were approved for those locations and certificates so once we get that approval then we will be able to start offering a pel to

the prisoners at gat prison great all right i started to title this next bullet austin update but i went ahead and spelled it out the coordinating board the tack office and a legislative update i will start with it with the coordinating board on yesterday the community college presidents and chancellors we had an introductory meeting with the new

coordinating board commissioner dr w rosser and it was a wonderful one-hour conversation with him he is a product of community colleges he graduated from kilgore and he believes in the mission of community colleges and has already done quite a bit of work in his previous life with different foundations and supporting the work of of and supporting the

work of of community colleges establishing pathways for students to a better life so he understands our language he understands our mission fielded several questions he let us know that we were his the first group that he was actually meeting with his focus obviously will be the 89th legislative session coming up but he is absolutely open to hearing

more from us hearing our questions he made note of several questions very humble what he did not know he did not try to answer he just made a note of it and what he did know he was willing to share so very pleased with that selection also the coordinating board released leas the request for application for the

nursing shortage reduction program for the fiscal year 25 grant cycle this grant supports institutional initiatives that enhance the capacity of nursing education programs in texas with the goal of increasing enrollment retention and graduation rates for nursing students so dr clunis and her team are currently preparing our application which we will submit i believe this month right okay

legis ative priorities under tax so tch association of community colleges there are lots of things that we are looking at but the three primary legislative priorities for this session include supplemental appropriations to the original request that will help us sustain what we are doing and serving our students formula funding for fiscal year 20627 just ensuring that we

have the funding that we need to meet the evolving needs of our students this is the second year of house of house bill eight this particular funding model so we are still learning quite a bit and then the third legislative priority is inclusion of private institutions in the performance tier funding so you you have heard previously that

one level of award is the transfer from so from community college to the fouryear and currently that fouryear has to be a public institution but as we know students go off to schools such as university of mary harden baylor and others so one of the things that we would like to see is the inclusion of those private

universi as well as the independent universities that students are attending so that we can receive the that performance award level the that performance award level of funding and then legislative update so to date one this is periodically i will come back mrs miss briggs and i we may tag team on this but as you know we do

not we closed that office we eliminated a position but i wanted to assure you that we are tracking the this session and so miss briggs has already set up a track a tracker for all things higher education and a couple of other spe special interest items for our staff to date two 234 bills have been filed for

consideration and you know filing will continue through i think it is march right so so we are on top of that and then of course we have resources in the tech association of school boards tech association of community colleges as well as the tex association of community college attorneys which miss briggs is a member of so and

finally service award ceremony the annual service award ceremony is scheduled for this friday december 20th at eight 30 we do have a social at seven 30 so if you are able to come we would love to have you there we have a seat just for you i said seven 30 you should did you see coffee and that

concludes my update sir thank you ma'am anyone question comments about the chancellor's report comment i want to go back to dr oser and miss oser and miss martin if every student could have access to what you just delivered it would be amazing i am very proud of both of you congratulations you heart your energy your desire to

do well was just laid out and i am glad miss martin you read yours because we could see i could see how you felt and yours dr oa yours showed in your emotion but thank you thank you guys for what you do in my life i have run across a couple of you but you know it is

like a poster that i gave my husband one time that says about eagles you do not find them in a group you find them one at a time and i just wanted to say that i think of you i will think of you guys as real eagles thank you for that thank you dr carter the legislative update

i know that you both of you are working on it will you just if possible if every meeting particular our workshop whichever you choose would you just let us know that there is are some new updates or there is nothing to report i'd appreciate that yes ma'am thank you and i had just had a question about the

four technicians of tomorrow is there any further planning on that or is it just going to be terminated the agreement has terminated have you all thought about approaching ccsd no i am sorry the ford people and see if they can offer the same type of program as general motors is but offer it for kisd and ccsd graduates

would like to go into that program i will reach out to them i have sent a communication to them with because in this particular instance the middle person is the transition assistance services but i have reached out to their for the ford representative to let them know that we are open that is sound like might be a

good idea yeah i like that i know some eighteen year olds would probably love to get good automotive training sure good point sir thank you anyone else thank you thank you man yes sir item five is to discuss consider approval of the annual financial report chancellor carter members of the board u lot buron and company has completed

their audit of your financial statements their audit of your financial statements for 2024 i remind you it contains three opinion letters the first of which deals with the formation of the financial statements that you see before you it is an unmodified opinion with no material weakness or findings the other two i will go over later with the

compliance side real quickly let us do some of my favorite variation analysis of the balance sheet and income statement i have included in your packet a three-page summary i like to refer to as the cheat sheet if you want to follow along with that instead of the book easier on page twelve of your afr you have your

statement of net position for fiscal year fiscal year 2024 indicator number one on your summary is total assets 276 50 this fiscal year up four million over last year your cash and investments are up about a million over last year and then what page are you if you are in the afr it is on page twelve there

is a three-page summary that staple summary if you it would be page that indicator number two is your accounts receivable at fifteen seven million and it is up 750 zero with your increase in tuition and rates for this fiscal year before i leave ar i have a quick update on ar as it relates to last year so

when we were going through our testing of ar and tuition revenue we could not get the variation analysis to come out so with the help of brenda thompson we went back and looked at between the two years between your tuition revenue in 23 and 24 and we had a three four million restatement of prior year ar so

when you look across the column there at that fourteen nine that is not what it was last year when i presented so we do have a restatement this year of ar it has increased your net position by three four million in 23 and also increased your accounts receivable for 23 as gby 100 states which was in effect

this year anytime you have a restatement or correction i have to corrected in every single number whether it is a footnote schedule or whatever in the whole afr and that has been done so when you look at the schedules at the back the footnotes that change has been made throughout the whole afr document any questions on that

before i go if you need more detail on it there is a note afr the other increase in assets is indicator number three your capital and depreciation indicator number four is your liabilities total liabilities 98 94 eight million down one six million over last year a couple of increases indicator number five your accounts payable at five two

million is up one seven million one six million of that is the brawn and butler construction programs or projects indicator number six the first item in indicator number six is your net position at eighteen nine million that is up a million over last year with the actuaries calculation and then the number below that is our significant decrease

in liabilities and that is your oped liability at 37 five million is down four million over last year the discount rate for opb as it relates to the raid return went from three 51 or three 59 to three 81 anytime that ratio goes up your liability goes down and i college indicator number seven is your college indicator

number seven is your net position right at 164 million for this fiscal year up nine million or five eight over fiscal year up nine million or five eight over last year as always from a reserve perspective of fund accounting if you will if i dare to say that perspective i'd like to take gby 68 and 75 out

of the equation which would be the pension and opb calculations so when i do that your total net position grows 239 zero million your unrestricted net position grows to 99 five million and that represents thirteen six months worth of operating expenditures so as a reserve of a old school reserve that is a very strong position for your

that is a very strong position for your balance sheet any questions on the balance sheet i have a question yes sir the ob the reducing and the liability that also gives us a better rate for our insurance also right correct so we are look we are going to look at a hopefully a reduction of our insurance liability

you hope that liability continues to go down you know the main reason for that rate return obviously discount rate going up is because of the interest rates correct the one that needs to go down is the health cost trend rate and when the health cost trend rate goes down it goes or when that when that rate goes

down this liability tremendously goes thank you any other question if you flip the page in the summary to the statement of revenues and expenses or if you are following along in fourteen total operating revenues indicator number one 38 one million for this fiscal year up five million or 177 over last year your biggest increases tuition of fees

at 28 nine million is up six eight million again that is after i made the change from last year so still a very significant increase i went back and looked you know because we have always talked about tw tuition rate tuition's going down leveling off going down so back in 2019 you had 33 and a half million

in tuition as it relates to the texas campus so as of now for 2024 this is the first year you have received a significant increase in tuition since that date and so that is a very very good thing so then your federal grants and contracts indicator number three they only you know significant decline at three two million

it is down about a million we did have over 500 zero in a true grant last year kind of related to covid it still exists but it is a very small amount and it is considered a state date total operating expenses indicator number four at 87 five million is up four three million or five over last year

a lot of variation here the main decrease you have across all departments salary and benefits are down about six four million then you have some increases in institutional support indicator number five that is up one four million over last year primarily due to the gby 6875 acral entries indicator number six your scholarships and fellowships at 22 million

is up five million over last year again that is with the tuition increase and as i will speak of later you had a pretty large increase in pel grant income so that is the why that expenses up depreciation ind indicator number seven at five one million is up one four million over last year again we added leases

and subscriptions and all that kind of stuff last year and the year before so that is going to continue to go up and level off as it has amortization expense attached to it along with depreciation and then random variances your continuing ed is up almost a half a million with your truck driving program and then insurance expense

went back and looked at it is up over a million dollars over last year i am seeing that trend at a lot of rates nonoperating revenues is indicator number eight at 58 three million is up eight million over last year seventeen six your state appropriations indicator number nine is up two six million over last year indicator number

ten your federal revenue at six seventeen nine million is up three eight million again that is your pale alone was increased by four million this fiscal year and then investment income number eleven at five two million is up two one million because you are actually with all that being said indicator number twelve nine right at nine million

and expenses as i alluded to earlier there is compliance again the next page in the summary or page 63 in the afr these deal with the internal controls in the state and federal programs the first opinion letter deals with internal controls as it relates to the financial statements it is a unmodified or clean opinion with no findings

the second opinion letter deals with the compliance as it relates to both state and federal programs it is unmodified or clean opinion with no findings and then you see there item number seven identifies those major programs on the federal side we are back to student financial aid we do not have covid money anymore so we are not

having to audit that as major and then over on the state side you see it was teog for this fiscal year as a result of all that testing all of this goes into the data collection form at the fed level indicator number ten and eleven there those are the primary goal of this whole old section and that

is to qualify as a low risk a for both federal and state compliance i do not have any questions on that you should have a staple document i refer to as the management document i refer to as the management letter this letter is separate from the audit it is a required question and answer session from me the

auditor to the board or the audit committee if you have one everything in the front of this is of a positive nature in the middle of page one the only thing i will note the only accounting change was that gasby 100 we already talked about that about correcting all changes throughout the document whether they be prior year

or current year and that has been done the rest of the answers and questions question and answer is of a positive nature we did not have to get legal involved no console things of legal involved no console things of that nature then on the very last page of the report it offers a opportunity for me the auditor

if i see insignificant if it was significant it would be a finding in the audit if i say insignificant weaknesses noted that i can communicate this to the board and the hop that it does not become a finding later on in the audit growing into more of a large control risk problem so we do have one comment

back there again i alluded to the state side we did audit teog as a major program this year and so when we first came in and audited teog we noted that there was an over award possible over award for teog now to give you a little background on teog you can come back it is allowed at the

end of the year to reallocate your teog funds if you happen to have awarded too many or too less and so we noted around 360 zero over awards in teog the majority of those in fact predominant all of that was be able to be reallocated so you do not have a finding so when you look at the

state federal fund schedule it is correct it shows one million of teog funds and that was awarded to the college when we first came in that number was larger it was over the actual award amount and you reallocated some of those funds to eligible programs to stay in compliance with teog so my recommendation is just to reconcile

this more on a periodic basis so that reallocation that you are in is not so large you it is always going to be a little just to do it on a more frequent basis so that year end it is a it is an insignificant amount of it is a it is an insignificant amount of reallocation any questions

on that i have just got a recommendation chairman that on a recommendation chairman that on that the takes the education opportunity grant let us have our internal auditor give us a report back say the first meeting in april to see if we are on track and any anything needs to be of any other questions then i present
