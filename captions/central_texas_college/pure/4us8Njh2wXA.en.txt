also i'd like to thank you for the opportunity to lead the men and women of the central texas college police department what i have seen so far from that small group of folks that we have right now is pride honor determination and a willingness to make sure that this campus is safe and they should be applauded for

their efforts as well having two people come back out of retirement just to make sure that operation is running is u a testament to the character of those individuals and of this organization so i applaud you for the people that you have in place here that is that is commendable so i am free to answer any questions

that you have after the meeting where i come from where i have been who i am but for now i will say thank you i appreciate it thank you thank you thank update before cavazo legislative tour day i shared with you all that the the biannual visit from the capitol to fort cavazos the visit started on our

campus so we had senator flores representative buckley and representative hickin along with some of their staff members and a couple of other legislators from other areas along with some community members that were invited by the chamber to participate we began the day with an over greetings from the legislators of course and then i was given the opportunity

to provide an overview of central texas college and our legislative priorities as outlined through the texas association of community colleges so that went well and then we traveled over to fort cavazos to hear an initial briefing from lieutenant general kevin abal on three core and their mission so that was really good the the group then went to

they broke out into sessions where they worked with well not worked but they observed and interacted with the soldiers to learn what it is that they do to maintain military readiness and went through some simulators and that sort of thing so overall they had a really great day with some of the feedback that we with some of

the feedback that we heard oh sorry next item community college day we have a couple of students here with us i will call them up shortly so on monday or tuesday my days are get mixed up february 3rd we took seven central texas college students who partic to the capital who participated in the biannual community college day

at the capitol which is hosted by the texas association of community colleges i was so proud of our students they joined 800 plus other students on the south steps of the capital and they rallied as they advocated for themselves they listened to a couple of speakers then they rushed the building to get to those legislative offices and

have their voices heard they did an amazing job they represented this in we we have a we have a press release piece that is on our website and that we have sh so maybe we will see that in the media but for now i would like for shahid rasul and desiree boston to come forward and just share

a little bit with day good afternoon you guys i am desire boston i major in psychology here at ctc and i am a team member of met impact chapter here at ctc good afternoon ladies and gentlemen i am shah ras the vp of social media foret impact thank you so much for this opportunity and i am glad

to get to speak with you guys when we were invited to the capital for community college day when we were invited to the capital for community college day i myself got to have a better understanding of what the annual event was and it was basically to advocate for community college students who could not advocate for themselves with

the problems that we endure the problem that i addressed within the capital was the pipeline between twoyear community colleges and for year universities with transfer credits it is extremely important because we do a lot of work within the community college and it just seems unfair that our credits get lost and it is like the streamline is not

very seamless as it should be yes and as i mentioned my major is psychology so i was advocating for mental health i basically stated how many community colleges are lacking funding in the mental health system and it is 2025 a lot of our priorities are mental health people are taking mental health days off and that i needed

to basically highlight on that i let a lot of the state representatives and the senators and you know their colleagues see that if we invest in mental health right now there will be higher graduation rates and with that the workforce in texas will be more productive and there will be a better a positive outcome with all of

that thank you are not they amazing at this time dr garrett will update good afternoon excuse me as of census which was january 29th we do we did end up with a ten overall increase in our spring reportable enrollments this year so i was really pleased that we still we stayed up from what i reported we went

down a little bit but close to what i reported last time we were here we have eight 391 unduplicated students as a student head count for the spring that is actually 465 more students than spring of last year it is good news any questions anyone questions thank you ma'am dr garrett can you stay right there oh okay

so the national center for inquiry and innovation couple of well actually three years ago u stood up its first cort or rural pathways guided pathways for project for community colleges and that first three-year period just ended and so they were in phase two you are gonna have to jump in and help me phase two so we learned

about we learned about this project a couple of months ago and we did not know we did not know much about it but we knew that we wanted to leverage the resources the subject matter experts the tools that were being provided through this program to advance our work particularly in the service area the service area is it

it is not been the liked it but it is been difficult to serve simply because resources have been short and so as we look to improve our processes and the things that we do to better serve that area we need some support we need some support and so this will accelerate the work that we need to do

the process i will let dr garrett talk about the process but we were we were extremely excited i will let her share the good news in terms of how we were selected and where our first trip is where we are going yeah it was we are very excited that we were selected we very quickly we had to

pull together a lot of data and a lot of information to submit our application for this the rural pathways project it builds on what we are doing with texas pathways already but it helps us focus on the our rural areas texas pathways really focuses on full-time in college at the main campus and so this opportunity helps us

take that information and additional knowledge research and knowledge from other institutions that have already gone through this and have helped to develop their rural areas and apply it to our service area and so we are so excited to be able to take that information from them and help us because we know we need to improve there it

is a continuous improvement and by having the opportunity to work with these people that not only have done the research but have helped other schools i am just i am really i guess tickled about it and we our first trip is over spring break to new orleans and what is good about this program is they pay for

it is part of this grant they pay for the hotel and all our meals while we are there except for dinner and we just have to get there with our team and we have got a team of six of us eight of us going and we are excited about that it is a three-year program it is going

to take us you know three years working through and improvements but we have been doing texas pathways now for eight years and we are continuously improving through that as well so the it is going to provide a way to reduce the barriers that our students in the rural areas experience to student success and that is all what

we need and it all aligns with our strategic plan for student success priority one good dr garett i was thinking of texas pathways when i said community colleges but i believe this is colleges and universities correct i am sorry what i said i was thinking of texas pathways when i said community colleges but this is colleges and

universities i i am not sure i think you are right i i am going back in my i think there are universities and poes the way this process works is the first the first group of students there were 50 i mean colleges excuse me there were fifteen colleges and when they initiated the application process across the mind

you these are schools across the nation that applied for this program and as dr garrett said we were able to pull some things together pretty quickly and we landed in the final nineteen a group of nineteen who were the finalists from across the country and then we we were we sat down and went through an interview process

with with nci and it was it was awesome dr garrett dr clunis myself dr oser we interviewed with them we shared with them the reason we believe that we would be a fit for this project because on the surface you know on the surface it looks like we have sered kisd and ccisd only and those you would

not call those rural communities but what we did was we explained to them our ten zero square mile service area that deserved the same opportunities those students in those areas and those communities deserve the same opportunity of economic mobility as those here in our taxing district and so they were very intrigued by our situation in that regard

but also the fact that we sit across the street from fort cavazo so we were selected and we are excited about that yeah one of the other things is it is not just us with our there we had to involve key stakeholders and they will continue to be involved throughout the three-year process and one of one of

the three things that they list as a as a outcome is to increase the economic opportunities in those areas not just education but how we can increase the economic opportunities for the students and for the businesses and the in those areas so our supporters for this project because we had to include local supporters were of course the

workforce for cavazos the school districts the university and business owners so it the support was huge and we appreciate the support was huge and we appreciate that report how soon do they expect to having g granted us the opportunity to participate how soon are results expect it we do not know a lot of that yet we we

will go to our first big meeting like i said over spring break in new orleans we will have a little bit better idea of the timeline and the work that we will be doing over that time period and usually you take you know that they have a specific like with texas pathways you are focused on a specific

area and you analyze the data and you look for what you can do moving forward and you start working on those and each session adds more and more objectives to it so i look forward to coming back and letting you know what we have learned at each one thank you ma'am okay legislative update on the federal level

on the on the federal front just lots of discussion lots of changes not sure what is what is u what is sticking just yet i guess i should say but one of our primary concerns and what we are focusing on is the impact of these changes on pel and funding for our students that is huge so we

will continue to track that because they are called calling us and they want to know state bills continue to be filed as you as you probably are aware house committee assignments were just made last week i believe miss bricks and so they have not begun their work because they just receiv received their assignments but right now the

two bills that i think we that are notable are sen house bill one and senate bill are sen house bill one and senate bill one those are the general appropriations bills and it is interesting that for the community colleges the line item for funding is identical across both bills now i do not know if that will remain

throughout the session but for now they are identical there was about a four increase in the the proposed appropriations for community colleges over last year we have we have performed i think better collectively better than expected so and the governor is very committed to supporting community colleges and the texas higher education coordinating boards ask for us and

that is all i have do you want to add anything m havens you have a report about the election process next week i will bring the contracts for approval with for early voting and election day with the city of the city of parker heights and kisd election day will be may the three and we will have noan

bill set up at parker heights has led us hold a prec sington parker heights rec center and coral county working in conjunction with k ccisd will be at the school on sunny lane anyone man' now always put the chief back to man' now always put the chief back to work racial profiling report yes sir good afternoon again

i believe you provided with the details from the racial profiling report for the year 2024 just a quick highlight of the report the report includes data for nineteen motor vehicle stops of those stops thirteen warnings were issued written warnings six citations there was only one search which was a consent to search and 68 of all 68 of

those nineteen stops resulted in written warnings as i mentioned earlier before the meeting one of the things that we want to do is pursue texas police chief's best practices and so as you as we move forward and you see this report again next year some of the things will change to include new policy and out of curiosity

your report said you had one stop on a county road where what is a county road that we have in our district here i mean where was that taking place i would have to pull that particular stop to gather that to see where that roadway was i do not recall exactly i do not recall a county road

within our jurisdiction here so that is why i am asking i do not know where it was sure would like to know though i can certainly find that cu i and i did go through all of the citations and written warnings that were issued for all of last year just to make sure that they were allocated appropriately

on the on the spread sheet it is all done manually so but i will certainly find that thank you for you anyone else any that thank you for you anyone else any other questions thank you yes sir thank apologize that is i did not see her here that is why i thought maybe she was not g okay

pardon me all right we take you well good afternoon members of the board i am here to share with you all a national initiative that ctc would like to join and we are having we have the opportunity to join this because of a grant that we have received that is going to support the funding for it but

i am going to go over a little bit about what it is it is called the caring campus program and it is coordinated by i am going to read this institute for evidence-based change that is a lot of words but let me break it down for you the caring campus initiative is basically aimed at building student retention

connection a sense of belonging and this completely aligns with our mission as you know that particularly with priority number one enhanced student success and priority number three continuous assessment improvement of operations and services now what this is it pretty much aligns with our work with texas pathways like what dr carter and dr garrett were talking about earlier

this completely aligns with our work with texas pathways as well and what is going to happen is we are going to be given a coach that is going to work with us for over about a year across twenty sessions with our faculty and our staff and what they are working with us on is getting us to agree

to certain commitments about student retention a sense of belonging and all of these things that are really hard to put your arms around you know it is easy to talk about student success but putting it into practice is a harder thing and so the coach is going to work with these the two distinct populations to to get

their commitments for this and then to put plans in action so the timeline is going to be we would love for this spring to start working with leadership as well as the staff and to have all of their work completed this spring and we will begin the research for the faculty the faculty will then take on their

part for this initiative in the fall with the idea of completing all of our work early spring 2026 and this is aligns with this grant that we have received because the completion of the grant is august of 26 so it is really i think it is an incredible opportunity that we have been given the hope is that

we can scale all of this work within two semesters and so really have a concrete plan in terms of really creating this sense of belonging and this connection for students and you know how important that is with house bill eight and the performance-based funding and we have to be about persistence and retention and completion and the sense

of belonging truly contributes to that and that is what this initiative is going to do for us having said all that this is not a cost-free program so we pursued a grant it is through the te the texas higher education coordinating board it is our third success grant and we were third success grant and we were awarded

250 zero as part of this grant 100 zero of it is being specifically designating designated for us to join caring campus and to participate in this initiative so what i am what i am asking i am asking the administration to the board to approve to spend 100 zero from the student success grant to formally join over 150

other colleges in participation of the caring campus initiative questions i have one perfect so we got traditional and non-traditional students here will this benefit both absolutely because what this is going to do is it is going to encourage dialogue it is a grassroots efforts and so it is going to encourage dialogue from the staff and the faculty

about what kind of commitments all of our students are entitled to what kind of changes and processes that we need for me in looking at it and talking to other colleges that have gone through it has tremendous implications for our student experience and understanding our student populations for our marketing campaigns our messaging our communications onboarding training a

faculty and staff hiring a faculty and staff so absolutely that will fit right staff so absolutely that will fit right into it good question brenda how will you encourage all of our staff to participate okay well the caring campus they have a very systematic process that they are going to put us through and what will happen is

our coach will work with us and help us identify the people that have to be involved in that now the caring campus they do not they want to work with all student facing groups but they believe every department on our campus is student facing so that means police department will participate that means risk management that means maintenance

that means accounting certainly my area certainly student services but a representative will be a part of all of that not everybody it is going to be kind of like a train the trainer mentality but key people will be a part of that and be expected to take that back to their departments and so it is also doing

a lot of work i am sure we you have heard like this idea that we have silos and we operate within silos and the idea is that we break all that down so our coach will be instrumental in helping us determine who will be the faculty who will be the staff and how we make all of that

happen do you know how many how often that your train your trainer will be on we are going to have o over twenty meetings with this person so across this time it is a lot it is a it is a very intensive professional development opportunity so it is over twenty when you add them up they are split

between faculty and staff and then the work with leadership great sounds good thanks you have one just you mentioned it is similar to the pathways is it overlapping requirements or collaborative requirements it is a collaborative it does not take the place of pathways it builds pathways as dr garrett i am sure dr carter has explained pathways has

different pillars to it and one of the p pillars is keeping students on path as well as removing the barriers for students this contributes significantly to that to those pillars and so where we learned about this initiative was at texas path way several of us sat through several meetings about it we have also learned about it through

the aspen institute as well as interviewing other community colleges in the state of texas who've gone through it so it is kind it contributes it does not replace pathways though okay one of the reasons for my questions is that in the past where i have been in situations where i have this initiative here i have this initiative

here i have this data set that i got to report then i have to reformat it to meet this data set reporting requirements and it just becomes cumbersome and i want to make sure that our folks have enough time to do their job in addition to this that is a great that is a great question i do

not think that the idea they have done this at 150 institutions across the nation the idea is not to take away from anybody's job but actually to enhance it and to make it better so that we actually serve our students better so i do not think that is the goal at all for this program okay well if

we do not do this well we will not have any students to that will account we would love to be a model institution in this area and to be able and i think the institutions that participate in this certainly move in that direction so it is exciting it is a great opportunity for us did you have another

question it is a great opportunity my only question is long-term passed two years what is the cost it there is no cost it is a onetime 100 zero investment that the grant is covering for us and we will we will sustain the efforts on our owns there is no cost it is really training us to be the

best success practitioners that we can be sounds good yeah thank you zero cost pardon me zero cost well there is a c just not from yeah that is the only yeah that is opportunity several years ago while i was in public school work i was involved in a similar kind of thing to try and develop on our

camp campus a caring feeling approach and i discovered some interesting things i taught next door to a older retired gentleman who had no desire to be a touchy feely kind of teacher he just this is my way or the highway and right and then i discovered in this i was part of the study group i discovered that

there were students that did not want to be cared for i am going to be curious to see how this process works to try and mend those broken bridges or to maybe build right understand that when we when we talk about caring we are really talking about meeting the students where they are so yes a component of

that can be the touchy feeling and for the student that wants to hug could be a part of that but also it is understanding our student population and there they have differences and caring campus is very clear and telling us that our caring campus and how we bring it to life here is going to look very different

from other institutions they are going to be very respectful of our student body and our culture and what we bring to the table and it is going to be built based on those based on those realities good thanks anyone else one more comment ever since i have been on the board and you have been presenting to us

you always bring us things that will help to build relationships with our students i just i think this is a great idea i look forward to it and knowing you i am sure it is going to be successful in the process just make sure that we do not have i do not know how many instructors we have

100 200 whatever that only five people show up that is i we have to find a way that everyone buys in to the same process no our instruction side is involved in this it is i i am up here presenting it to you this is a collaboration and part the caring camp has been doing this a long

time and they have a process for selecting the faculty and everybody that makes a commitment and to be involved in this so and like i said they have had they have a ton of experience doing this like i said over 150 other institutions and several community colleges here in texas and they all talk very positively about that

experience and mak happ opportunity presents itself i think everyone on the board is interested in making this a best opportunity or best environment for students to learn so given an opportunity whatever we need to do to if we need to come and visit sometime or to talk to the group one of us will show up absol to

enourage thank you i we will make sure the coach thank you i we will make sure the coach knows that anyone else thank you ma'am appreciate did i need to vote on it oh thank you thank you no i want it oh thank you thank you no i want it now good job dean starky dr cruz s

i you hello board of trustees and dr carter i am here in november 2024 you helped approve the smart program woohoo and we have been rocking and rolling ever since then so we have been outlining courses we have been doing some advising and when during the outline of our courses we are trying to enrich three of the

courses we currently already have and we appli for a grant we were the recipients of the texas reskilling and upskilling through education grant the true grant and i am before you today to try to purchase a 3d printer and a tensile machine and so the idea of this is that we are going to have our students this

is super exciting we are going to have our students draft machines 2d on autocad and then 3d on solid works so it is a 3d then they will be able to print it on the 3d printer and then they will be able to test the strength of it and that is what we need the t machine for

so the t machine will test the strength of the machine then we will use our robots to be able which we already have we will use our robots to be able to show them how to manufacture more how do we copy it pack it and send it which is of course is all manufacturing so we are super

excited for it we already have the robots we have actually been dealing with space too we have acquired space in the planetarium for what we are going to call our smart lab and so we are going to put our robots are already there we are going to put our 3d printer there we are going to put our

tena machine there and so it is going to be the smart lab where all students will be able to go and and be able to do these projects and so four 388 i said that really fast but it is a part of a grant so i am just asking to spend because it is over 50 zero questions

i understand it is part of the grant yes sir i understand grants come and go yes sir what about our sustainment cost what is it going to cost us five years from now so with the machine the tensile machine itself unless there is anything that breaks it there is no additional materials that need to go into it

we do have an insurance for five years from my understanding that comes with the with the purchase the a 3d printer now that does come with materials and what i have done is working it out by shopping and doing the vendors they are supplying us with an 188 zero credit for materials with that so we should be

good for the next couple of years and then during that time we will be looking for more grants and to sustain the program as the and to sustain the program as the program grows is it a plastics only or does it do the metal it is plastics only that is do the metal it is plastics only that

is right the metal ones are super expensive i will be back later for that it is okay anyone else other question thank you ma'am thank you dr you got a ap i got a pile just a few just a few first i'd like to i'd like to preface the next two items by saying that for the first

eighteen months in my first eighteen months as chancellor i did a pretty deep dive into our operations some things we were able to address pretty quickly some things are ongoing but the whole idea is continuous improvement and improvement in terms of how we serve our students and run this college student success is the north star thank you

very much for always letting me know that dr garrett but during that time i have been able to identify you know some strengths some gaps some opportunities and our team has done a really good job in addressing some of those issues prior to prior to september one 2023 when i assumed the office we we had a dr

help me dr gara did a secret shopper exercise on the college and so i thought that is the perfect it is it was a nine-page report of opportunities for improvement and so we made that the focus last year and we are wrapping up some things this year we have made some really good headway in how we manage

our student accounts our our processes over on the student financial side our website enrollment all those things i am sorry communications big one big one so we took that to heart i gave it to dr garrett and said you know this is our report card i need you to fix it and so has been working on that

but in a in on a on a larger scale what i have noticed are two areas that we really need some support in and that is data we need to we need to build a data infrastructure we have the systems we have we have great staff but what we do not have is an inst let me back

up alcantar is the first one thank you mr pierce i said he is moving a piece of paper over here what is he doing alcantar strategies is the is the first one you know the governor wants us to build a world class higher education where community colleges align with regional workforce needs house bill eight was the impetus

for that and it is the old playbook just will not work you know we are not we are not funded by contact hours time and seats it is performance there are performance metrics built into house built eight that require us to be a little more intentional if you will about the work that we are doing what happened

is prior to the implementation of house bill eight many colleges got out in front of that and started hiring chief strategy officers and you know others with that type of experience two of my colleagues i talked to them and i thought where'd you get the money for that you know because salaries and benefits you have to pay

continuously right so i met mr alcantar and he is actually been to the college when we did college credit for heroes many years ago you remember that we were awarded that grant through tww so a lot of times when you see college credit for heroes and it is on other colleges websites we did that so mr alcantar

was really familiar with central texas college he was once the chairman of the texas workforce commission and he is very well known in the state and does a lot of work for various organizations so i asked him i said would you would you come meet with me because i need to accelerate some work and i explained to

them where we were and where we needed to be in order to in order to fully implement house bill eight as it is changing there are some changes that are in discussion right now and so you can see from the news several other schools have have really taken off with house bill eight their numbers look good some

of them are building new buildings around programs etc i would like to accelerate our work not really to catch up but to get us where i know we need to be and rather than hire a chief strategy officer rather than bring someone on staff permanently to help us with that effort we have a as you know our

team shrink a little bit several months ago i believe that a consultant for a maximum of twelve months and with my 30 my 30-day out clause thank you miss bs would be very beneficial to the to the college it would help accelerate the work that we need to do in order to meet that skills gap that workforce

need as governor abbott continues to bring in new businesses many of these jobs do not require bachelor's degree they just require credentials of values but it is important that we align our work with industry needs and so it is going to require partnerships with not only our and we have the partnerships with the with the school districts

but we have to align the school districts the workforce and business and industry and so he is he is he does that very well and i welcome the help we need the help it is not that we cannot get there but this is this is twelve months or less versus a couple of years and house bill eight

has created an extremely competitive environment it is a it is a specific p there is some base funding for everyone but at the same time those per those performance outcomes are a big chunk of our appropriations now so i believe it is in the we have the funding for it it lines up with our strategic plan i

think there are two priorities that we identified so i am just asking for your consideration in that i believe this is a much more fiscally responsible approach versus hiring personnel which i can do i just choose personnel which i can do i just choose not to dr carter you have both the alcantar recommendation and the trivium recommendation

how much have has alcantar worked with trivan no they are two separate because one is mr alcantar and his company the consultant he will help us align our work our efforts our programs with the with industry needs we will also leverage not only his knowledge and his skills but his connections i will just say it his connections

to certain industry as well as private funders because we want to continue to get funding to do some of the things that dr that dean starky is doing and some of the other projects that we have so i have this i have this little i have this little black book full of dreams and they cost money but

they also take time and so i believe that an agreement with mr alcantar will help accelerate that he is he knows his way around austin he has some pretty good connections and as i said i believe that this is a much more fiscally responsible route versus hiring someone and he would be he would work with our leadership

team as well as some others as we have different meetings and so that there is buyin you know this is not someone coming in to just completely dictate anything to us we are going to let him know where we are what we want done and he is going to help guide us as he did i mentioned another

college there and in the write up but and he currently works with several of the other schools within tax anyone okay the next item same situation this is this is something else that we you know identified during the last eighteen months it is the data piece what i what i would like to see and i believe everyone

who is on our team our administration i see mr over there nodding his head we want to we need to it is not even just a want we need to move to a a datadriven decisionmaking culture currently we do not necessarily do that unless it is a unless it is project specific the way our system is set

up and this is this is not an indictment against anyone it is not that anyone's not doing their job but the way we are currently set up is if you have access to a particular reporting tool then you can you can create a report establish the parameters and pull the numbers well if you have got five people

pulling the same information you may very well get five different answers and it is because we do not have a data infrastructure or a data culture our team has done an amazing job with what they have they i mean i could not ask for a better team but i feel i believe not i feel that it is

my responsibility to ensure that they have the resources necessary to do the work that i am asking them to do and so as we look at adopting a data culture as we look at building a data infrastructure i believe it is necessary to bring in a data services contractor dr r hines is the ceo of trivium and

he has done amazing work with other institutions that we have talked to and so as a matter of fact when he hit my radar i asked him would he come spend the day with us him would he come spend the day with us for free because i thought it was important that this not be a decision because

the majority of the work would be performed by the staff i felt like it was necessary for the staff to have an opportunity to engage with him and so we provided some data he created a data book for us some of which we used to in our response to the nci project and he spent an entire day

we had a plinary session and then we had breakout groups and the feedback was extremely positive i had several folks ask me are we going to hire him when are we going to hire him and so what i am really excited about with regard to this particular agreement is there are clear deliverables and i outlined that i

outlined those in the and that communication but i am really excited for dr garrett's folks dr garrett has department institutional effectiveness led by dr carrie rose we do not have an ir department but we have a group of folks that with the right resources and training can get there and i feel like it is i know it

is our responsibility to make sure she has that i think during the workshop we had to pull the microphone away from dr car rose if you can believe that you' probably not heard her say two words but she was highly engaged during the workshop had tons of questions and i know that she is one that would really

appreciate the additional support we believe that maybe twelve months but some schools have taken longer so the original agreement was for eighteen months i said one year and a six-month option if we need to so again we do have the funding this lines up with our strategic priorities it supports continuous improvement but more importantly it supports our

students anybody questions yes it sounds a lot like the efficiencies organizations that we are seeing pop up and i will just leave it there is there an expectation that we will have a return on investment greater than the cost yes now let me say about the efficiencies that organizations that you are seeing we had our workshop before

that yes you know as a business owner and former military guy this is something i would always go through myself how can i do it better faster smarter less expensive and then make the adjustments as we go so anytime we you know throw some outlay of funds we want to make sure that the return on that is

at least as much as what we are expending so ab absolutely so what this will allow us to do is when we think about house bill eight and the various performance metrics we what happens is they provide us with our own data that we provide to them in whatever format we can look at how we were funded

for associate degrees let us just let us choose that particular credential and if we are we look for those areas we were less i think it was we are funding for the next bium i think was less than the previous year but so what we can do is we can take the data from those what we need

to be able to do is take the data from those associate degrees drill down in within the programs within the classes to figure out what is going on what happened one of the examples that was given to us or to me as i was researching this is you will be able to look at a chart and let

us say you see a decline in enrollment in the science classes and so initially you will think oh well we have got to recruit more students but really you want to look behind that data point to see what is going on because the students behind there is a student behind every data point so when you when the

when the college drilled down further they noticed that the barrier to those science classes was actually the prerequisites okay so they were able to further drill down into the prerequisites to find out what is going on there and so this is data that we'd be able to look at real time we would not be looking at it

you know mrs coley always mentions this you know looking at something you know a year too late because then it is too late and so what we are talking about is standing up a data infrastructure that allows our staff to not only extract the data but to analyze the data interpret the data and then we make some

serious decisions about the next steps it will also allow us to provide you with dashboards you do not have to wait every month to have dr garrett because she did not know that was her assignment now every month two months in a row makes it every month right so you know to come forward and provide you with

an update we get dashboards you know we get those implemented you can go in yourselves to see exactly what is happening with enrollments you know how many students are taking this you know six hours or more those kinds of things and so and also our community we will be able to put some of that on our website

and our community will be able to see it it is a it will be able to see it it is a it also it will streamline some of the work and it is a serious gap for us not having a solid data infrastructure rure while we also adopt the data culture now i am going to throw something

in there okay predictive analytics through ai is that something that could be integrated with this hey i am pay yes and predictive analytics is a part of it predictive analytics that way you can see the train before it hit you right exactly and so that is a poor part of it we we want to move into more

forecasting as it relates to our budget and to do some things that we have not traditionally done but as i have been saying and i think my team is tired of hearing it progress without change is impossible and we have to change our playbook and how we are doing things now that is not obviously that is not

an original quote but i got a question so u would this give us better forecasting on like i said student in a 60 hour course for graduation with associates if it is taking them 66 to 72 hours to graduate with that six degree and how long that average student actually stays at ctc to achieve that degree absolut

because with like house bill8 it is graduation rates and stuff absolutely and u like if you got a student four years to get a two-year degree we are waiting that much longer to get fully funded on it and so to your point what this will allow us to do will accelerate in terms of identifying what the issue

is and quickly addressing it and making adjustments it'll make it that much easier for us to pivot where we need to and to address student needs real thank you any recommendations for topics for upcoming agenda items m did yes i have got one going back to dr garrett's briefing sa cc we affirmation process in our documents that

the board approves we do one annually finance counting so that is one in our ticket right there i would like to see on our agenda the review of board documents at least quarterly and through a cycle of eur we can do all of them or we can take one meeting and do all one time but i think

if we integrate them in our process we will get through our ten or twelve board documents that we are responsible for at least every three years i think that would satisfy ta coc and get us off the hook there good idea that is my recommendation sounds good idea j i am good just a concern that i got

hit with and i just wanted to make the chan aware of it the v the va counselors that are counseling our students they are not up to date on the on certain like the 35 and the 36 and the 31 they need to be more and which is causing them to go which having our students to go

back and forth trying to get make sure that they are that the classes that they are registered for are qualified that they are qualified to take and there could be a little bit more clarification on it is not us but it is the va part if we could talk to them and see if they can get their

act together on the counseling part especially the va on the counseling part especially the va counselors sir the board meeting schedule for next tuesday the 25th of february and then a workshop in march on the 11th i did not look at the calendar when i saw that note is there a reason why it is not third and
