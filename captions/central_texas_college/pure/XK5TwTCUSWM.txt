you can make cuts you can cut the meat with a knife you can use a knife you can use a knife for a steak or a chicken i do not think so i do not think so i do not think so yeah i do not think so what was that the back of the chain no it is

not the back the back of the chain was in the back and i was very sad and i did not know i was very sad with the back of the chain with the knife i was very sad with the knife i mean it is good timing because we have been talking about this for a long time now

so i am really enjoying the fact that i can just sit with my mind at home and i can just chill out and just kind of sit at the same time i think that is one of the things i think is important i think that is a really good example of how to have this kind of space

so we have some examples here you see this is a small piece of a test i am going to roll it over to you it is a little bit bigger and you are going to try to roll it over from the spot that is right at the corner you are going to roll it over and put it

in a little hole and i am going to roll it over to you and you are going to move this a little bit and you are going to roll it over to me and i am going to get this on the wall i think that is what we will do we will take a few minutes to think

about what really is environmental science and science so i do not know what i would have done if we had discussed the water quality basically i do not know what i would have done if we had discussed this one we would have called it deep testing of course but i do not think the administration would have ever

been able to do it also brady and some of the other members of the group that purchased for environmental and geological testing for the fish at u-25 we are at fifteen six which is a little bit higher than the average so i think this is one of the conditions that we are in we do not expect this
