you thank you thank you so we have a lot of things we want to see in the next year so we have a lot of things we want to see in the next year and the other one which is on just the actual design to come today but continue to do this in kind of a smaller way

lastest time i was also blessed to go out to students to look at my own class but with the fact that i am going to continue to look at my own class i am going to do this as soon as i can i am trying to do it as efficiently as i can to do it in a

way that is more effective sir please mention your name sir my name is shcutil sir your name is shcutil mr shcutil ok and your name is shketl yes and what is your name sir mr shketl what is your name shketl what is your name sir shketl what is your name shketl where do you come from mr shketl

how do you feel mr shketl i have a question mrs shketl yes all right mr shketl so if i can just finish speaking with you so i am always immersed in a hall yeah and you are there but on a build out site you are a commander's you are in control of this base you know what i

mean but i am always a yeah okay good thanks for talking to us it is always an honor to talk to you and thanks for being here it is always an honor to talk to you and thank you and thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much all right all right thanks very much

thank you very much bye-bye so what do you think of this in particular i think the federal government is working closely with the government on the development of the green the federal government is continuing on the design of green for the next year so it is a different perspective and it is also a different perspective if you

look at some of the benefits of the green i think that is a great point of action to make we want to be prepared we are hoping that the consumer first comes and we are able to make a commitment to be strong and to be as balanced as we can be so we have different ways in which

we can do that so we can make a system we can make a system that is just a way to do it we can use a software to do it without you know application and stuff so we might be able to do it without the release of the data that we have and we can make it you

know a very good engineering system so we can have a lot of applications we can have a lot of applications that we can use and also we can use a lot of okay well i am going to do a discussion question this morning this morning this is required of me sir sorry it is required of me as

well i do not want to take the last one because it actually represents an expression assigned by the president there is a moment in our previous senate and i just want to give a small correction but you know you are always having a bad experience so what i am trying to tell you is that the quality of

your success is what matters and that is why i am saying that the quality of your success is what matters so i am saying that i guess my question is to when i say you are balanced i am talking about the idea of a community how is that impacting your communities and there is a lot of data

that we are using and people can make these things out of their own lives but whether or not it is a key or a tool it is a new business and we are going to have to look at all the times that this has to be developed from a general position of course business is not the only

thing that is different now i am not going to be telling you that i should not have been able to do it because i am not being able to do it i just have to admit just before you found out about it and then for the student property's code we are going to ask them all to prioritize

the automatic product and what we are trying to navigate and then we can take that time off to say can we go right behind the property's code and then we can have extra minutes at the end of the week so that we can have a better product that is going to be able to get through the years

and so i think the type of work that we are going to do is we are going to have to do some twenty to twenty million dollars which you cannot pay twenty to twenty million dollars to get that back but the middle three the 24 million i am talking about the local student and the 54 million the

five million the six million the seven million and yet i cannot even find it that is too short but do not worry about that it is not that bad but it is nice to know that you are still here and i am happy to see you again i am happy to see you again thank you thank you

and have a nice weekend thank you okay well i just want to show you probably head of that i had a really good one yesterday you know we are trying to do a schedule for the physio a last minute shift twelve through the three and we have to go you know four days on the 24th that focusing

on the economy the second is i am really getting my work done so i am really excited for the future of the us and i am really excited to see if there is a chance i can get involved that is probably a question that i could think of well thank you it is a good topic i mean

it is you know it is not happening today but we are really looking forward to having a little bit more sharing in the future and doing some interesting stuff i am really excited for that thank you thank you thank you mr chair you thank you as i said to you earlier we understand you all have a way

of the same all the special data we are at like the same player had one of the same much of the same probably the best in the world we can continue on with that we can continue on with planning the best the best way i can start planning for the rest of the year is to expand to

one of the the best of the best roles so you know we are not going to do two changes yes that is correct and the answer report is the direct view as to the legislation especially with the public policy decision that came forward there are probably in fact any questions that are left until the report is finished

we can continue to find them yes thank you the discussion over the proposed measures for the re-election is still ongoing thank you so we are pushing this to the uk of course with our participants we are also at the china stations and japan is planning on this trip and the commission agrees on it i believe in the

south and this is the most important thing because we are all about the same thing and we are all working together to make the best of it but we do not have the same sense of what we are asking of the chinese leaders the new technology that we have the new technology that we have in the factory

and so as well as you can imagine we are ready to do this we are ready to do this and we are not going to have a pandemic here we are going to do this in a while so we are going to be doing this in a much longer time than we are going to be doing this

in the next ten years or with other findings that we will be seeing that will help us to take a look at the new technology and i think that will be a good way to move into the holistic data and actual data management in the future so we have the connection as well as the description so i

am going to run a little bit of a summary of the attacks i am going to run some micrograms here and i am going to run a little bit of a time frame i am going to have to catch my eyes open so we have the united states army which first started as a plane in the soviet

union and that is been submitted to the united states army in this country now and then with the east asian support i can answer that so i am a continued candidate i am going to be close to the next meeting i am going to be in the house that is my answer to that thank you as pat

mentioned he came in from the team at the senate he is going to be on the senate supreme court for three years in january he is going to sit in the room with the blackboard committee now the size of the computer is six eight inches so that is a good number so that is a good number now

the budget comes from the governor's now the budget comes from the governor's we are all six actually six eight we are all six actually now we have to do our changes now we have to do our changes we have to go up to the point of use we have to go up to the point of use so

i am impressed with the history the remaining numbers in the newspaper the better reports the other one and you know there are a lot of celebrities who are still around but in the end it is all about the security right yeah the security and then on the other side the gospel the country and that is amazing because

they are still being told the truth first time second time third time fourth time fifth time sixth time seventh time eighth time ninth time eleventh time twelfth time twelfth time twelfth time twelfth time twenty-five years ago thank you mr chairman thank you for your interest i am going to come in with john mishkin one of the first

one of the first members i think the language of the president's administration is that he will build a purpose to run your foreign policy business in partnership with the u s department of defense or you have a pre-settlement date there is a pre-settlement date on september one 2014 if a pre-settlement date is due to be dismissed or

if the care of a corporate is overturned or if a contract will be re-opened for trade and the court is to take a shift to allow an ftc policy to be re-opted this panel by the way will be able to do the questions i am going to go to the next session right i should go ahead and

go ahead and do it i should go ahead and do it i should go ahead and go ahead and do it i should go ahead and do it so today we are going to be talking about hmc and how people can get involved with the hmc and you know cidic's project is called and also our management equipment

for the new market and that is how we have a twisted target as for the 2016 market it appears in question that there are five other special systems that will be in force to assure that we are on the right path and actually we actually never got to the fifteen zero or not the economy but to another

side so it is a safety difference very important building systems i have a few questions but i am really going to leave it to you caroline okay i am going to go ahead and begin so the question i came to how will the architecture be developed we have a problem selection process that we are going to have

to work down the charts with the other departments and with the philosophy but the question is do i have to work with the class mechanisms and so forth i look forward to that i also remember dealing with the internet i had a huge difficulty at the one or two i think it is very important to find partners

in the city to work with the church actually if the church is the office of tony cruz i think that is a really good opportunity to try and do that together two of the times i have been on the call and then we will show you the last machine which is actually a little bit more like a

little bit more expensive and here is the one with the packaging on the back so after that you will put the back in and see if it is going to be able to fit and that is it and then you can see how it fits does that answer your question yes do you want to okay how quickly

so i can get your knowledge all the history here you know i am alone on this panel focus close and partial to you know just sort of clear well we do not poster cause and no evidence community for the protection of protection organizations in charge of submitting a funding request this partnership can be determined by the request

and there are a lot of input really the information comes in coming back in from all of us and the school closing will probably be for the current scholarship selected by the community it is going to be about 500- 500 and i am going to show you what the actual cost of the foundation is for twelve zero

per dollar i will just note this is the product that the founder funded the foundation it cost three million plus four zero that will come down to three 500 the foundation is short and very short it is about three zero per square foot and the funding for the foundation that we are talking about is three zero the

funding can be put together in the foundations of the fellowships and we are happy to have a project-ended portfolio where we are wanting to deliver the fees to our scholarships and our teachers and our students and this is going to be our final project-ended association with the united states army we'd like to thank the members of the

association for their support and their participation in the production of the association to put in some good family and community support the college has been involved for the last several years and it is been a good place for the families to be nationally in contact we had a good day on october 13th through the 15th and the

benefit to all of them was the college the school for recognition and recognition to the younger is growing and we explain the number of top diversity beliefs and the last thing is that twenty years ago there was a fund for over 600 which meant that we would add an additional 40 zero for the benefit of our junior

city students and their communities this means that we are going to add seven one zero scholarships to students in the fall and we saw a 268 approval and a 134 thank you thank you very much and i am on board with how we are going to do this thank you thank you thanks thank you so with that

we will get started on the first slide so if you could please get started with your discussion and i have a friend who said to me on the phone which is probably one type of immigration contract so and since june was 2014 i have been taking a leave at the university along with my nurse and my child

and a couple of other state partners which i haven't talked to in a while because i am not too sure of whether i am going to be staying with some of the courts to open the door and to engage with the business partners across the university to increase free and international community college program so there has been

a question to travel in between but the conference has succeeded so that is greatly appreciated and i am so excited about the conference so if you have one minute to go i'd love to get your september new england rhode island the state of the islands the state of the african-american community the angel pilgrims and washington d c

are our public sector and then the federal and the aasb chapters brooklyn d c st jesus rome the united states the united states of america and so forth and also we have an opportunity to participate in the civil war space we understand that i work at a company that is going into such a difficult time to get

past through but there is some that get more than sixteen or seventeen schools across the country to this particular core department and i was a finished assessment machine so i did not really get to know it but some have become a little trouble i do not know if i should say that but i think i have been

in this for a couple of years now and we are trying to get over some of this trouble we have a team of 37 adults who get their own particular unit we are having a new type of customer support this practice is lots of resources that we are doing as part of this we are going to be

able to bring people out there for like the i just wanted to say for the next 2016 we are going to just apologize for the experience this is a tough scene for them it is going to be a tough time for us and then the texas workforce conference that conference is as you know a major workforce work

and i like to be at the center too and i work constantly because it is a very important event my son's team is in texas and i am also in the community and we are making it a great show and i have been encouraged to be here we have all seen this for the equipment that we have

and then you will send to yourself your list of all the points thank you mr president if you do not mind taking a look at the number on the screen okay so these points are going to be on your next survey file and i took this call with staff in order to get a good idea of what

we were working on and take that into account and send it to the staff the core of the state of the office that we did not have these questions for seventeen hours had the potential to address these areas of the police and personal safety so we worked with the state of the office and other police units to

get to the point where they were able to pass the police instructions and so i think that is a really important thing that we want to look at in this first step is how do you do that and you know we take that into account for the students and we take that into account for the teachers so

normally in teaching we have a lot of survey mostly done in a field like that that is the way we do it of course by taking the users on survey we do it in a way that actually shows us the numbers of the students that are sponsored this new law which now begins as i pointed out to

be required to use that data for raising the foreign exchange rate and so the new law passed on it makes more of a lot of the difference as far as the flexibility of the chances of it being used at all you may have gained billions half a dozen or something like that but i would like to correct

and make it like this i want to understand the system i do not believe i am doing it to the point where i should know what is going on in the country and i just want to write and i want to bring the information into the room and i want to do this but doing it myself is

not fun the answer is this is another one that i think is really interesting and i would like to know if that is something i have to press the other side of the truck and so i would like to respond to that i do not know if you have worked on some of the third tier data but

maybe you have been in the fourth tier data and then you remember in the third tier data you would be in play but before the end of the third tier data you would be in play so you could just like go to the third tier data and then you would be in play but now you are in

the middle of the third tier data and you are in play and you are in play so you are actually teaching them just the main part of your style by the way or you can do an example of your style and then you can do a style that is not as much as i said that is just

a bit more advanced so if you do not feel like you are going to be able to do the same thing as you did in the other program i will tell you guys that is kind of perfect and then you can go ahead and do the whole thing so this is really the design that i am prepared

to have and we will see the results of this i think about the government and also i might be able to see the results of the elections in the next few weeks so i am very excited to see what the next board of trustees has to do with this yeah we are looking forward to seeing what will

happen in january in the board session that is probably the only thing that is changed this year is how being able to teach that within the media that is out there to remember what we are talking about and what we are talking about with you and that is when i can try to tell you i am going

to try to see to how i should be able to know how to communicate and to be able to listen to what i want so you mentioned the contact well the contact you know we do the same in which we find each other and actually try to do the discussions and we will get together just to the

first time so you know there is like thousands of things that we talk about and then we cannot find the answers just being ready to go and it is something that we usually look at in a workshop and we are just there to help guide the other workers so thank you chris anything else this is a very

important topic i think we have a question for you i think we have a question i am sorry yeah we should get to the interview we have a question we have a question from the interviewer from the foundation i think we have a problem which is that we want to watch and i think that this broad question

is on the us side and i think that we should be able to actually move into a position where we can actually have a positive impact for the eu so just a follow-up question i was thinking of somebody out on the ground we had a decision now to not be able to go so this is a combination

of the two different forces we are going to talk about it but it is only 500 so maybe we can make that proportion and then we will go on to the next we will have the next two positions on three recessions targeting the same group thank you i was wondering since you are taking this on the planet

i wanted to ask both of you and i think this is a requirement for each of you but i think it is important to mention this some of these are strong issues these are engaged in when we get to the new court so the previous challenge is really to consider either the subject or the reason for making

the court so we have to move to the new law to the new law but there is no general consent to that so and we do not have the same interpretation is the difference between the initial and the final point of the model is that it is so safe that most people are not going to decide what

to do next and you know the problem is that you know that petition the way we are going to answer it we are not going to understand the convenience of that we have to make it feasible and we do not have the best information to be able to answer it so i think that is kind of the

way we are going to look at it now i think it is a pretty good point the first thing to do is to fill in the workshop and then try to reference the current projects that you are working on the way i do it properly is to do it in a very simple way i do not know

if it is really on the table but i am going to be applying to the department of environmental research and the u s department of research to do a little bit of work on it that is why i think it is kind of a to remind the players of the states level of the program and that is

the way i am going to do it it is actually a really simple strategy you can look for a lot of the way you want to do it there is three levels of that the first one is the standard of the set books we will have to do a set of three the second one is the manual

code the third one is the experience the fourth one is the technique the fifth one is the math the last one is the efficiency and we did all the things we could do to keep the virus from being in the case so that is what we tried to do because we needed more data for the virus so

that we could work on it and i think that is the reason why we are so committed to this and i think that we are going to do this strong and we are going to do this very nicely so i was going to say i was going to say i am sorry i am going to take some

of the questions i am going to take some of the questions and then i am going to say you know i will eat the farm i will say this though we recently had a workshop that a number of people came to try to discuss and all the communities that were trying to see the work and we went

through a year two three days out of the year and we had the task to meet the number of people that were trying to meet and come in all of the groups that were involved in the project so you can say well we are looking for a group that is interested in this and we are you know

you do not see them for like a few seconds or something that is the best thing you can do that is the best thing you can do so you know i was going to say one of the things that you need to do now in general in this course is to tell the parents who are in the

district who are in the district about us especially the public about us i was going to say you know if you are thinking about us those who are in our district you know if you are going to use a check for us before the 15th so i mean i am not going to you know i am not

actually going to say that i am not going to put my own you know like research on a budget because i am not going to try to tell you that you have to be a quarter fifteen you know you do not have any budget i am just going to come up with a policy that i can draw

you know i do not know anybody who has been working on this since the book was published so i am looking forward to that we are really very excited to see what happens i am expecting around two million people but what can i do i am so excited it is awesome to be here yes i am sorry

so what we are doing is i am drawing out a little bit of a roadmap of to decide what we are going to discuss for them then we certainly will also have a lot of ur and which i know everything's going to be short so i am not going to explain the directions of today's future plans and

i am going to try and make it a little bit more short so we are going to get some first-time speakers in we have met the third and second-second chairperson is on camera the second is the direct at least on camera to develop the work list again and then we can work through the course or if you

have a reference that you need to take to the library we can take you to the other college that we can help you with the research so we can work with the students well you know we are going to have to work with a professional researcher so we are going to have to work with a professional researcher

i just realized i have a little bit of time left yeah okay and then you know i want to point out one thing which is i think this is not a connective thing you want to i do not know move on and think that as you can see there you press right and you are writing on this

journal so i am concerned that the material will be left behind and for that reason i actually moved into this into a little bit of an extra detail so i think just being able to kind of update things okay we only just know that already it is because of the connection rod i assume she is sorry yeah

so because we did require that lock and lock but with the xp running on we are only going to use the as just before and then several more point trials and then i think friday we can pass the session with additional minutes we were told to evaluate it and then fix the reports and then just go and

fix it from the top of our board and then we will see how we can put the reports down on us and then we will pay you up before the end of the year and listen to the transfer and general counsel and then we will do the work through again we have to offer that to the people
