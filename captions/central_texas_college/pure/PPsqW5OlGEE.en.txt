i'd like to give miss halar an opportunity to come greet miss halar an opportunity to come greet the bit thank you i just appreciate this opportunity to serve here and continue serving at central texas college as department chair for the fine arts department we are looking forward to growing more to some innovative new programs coming in the

next few years and to being the best we can be thank welcome we also have a title nine reporting update at this time and i will turn that over to miss briggs yes ma'am as you know title nine see how loud i am today did you want me to go down there would that be better for you

can you all hear her on her microphone okay as you all know title n is a federal statute but there is also a state statute that runs parallel to it and the reporting requirements are actually in the state statute so it is texas specific historically you have received a report per semester so one in the fall that

reports for the summer semester one in the spring that reports for the fall semester and then sometime in the summer for the spring semester the statute requires one report either in the fall or in the spring so while we have been doing more than necessary it is it runs a little bit conflict with the other reports that

the title n9 coordinator is required to do which is quarterly and those do not line up so quarterly and three times a year have been a little bit confusing on the staff side so to keep to follow the state law what we are what we will be doing instead will be reporting once per year when you see

that report as you know you do not have details do not have names it is numbers that report is also placed on the website as soon as it is reported to you and it stays there and that will not change either the quar reports that the title n coordinator makes to the chancellor those will continue but the

jing of three and four per year were getting a little a little confusing and so we have spoken with dr carter and that is the change that we are proposing to make thank next i asked dr garrett to pro provide us with an enrollment update we will con we will do this regularly at the start of each

semester or term just to give you all an idea of where we are thank you dr carter i am excited i have been watching the numbers for spring and they look really good so far as of monday we have have had a twelve increase in enrollments for spring of the texas reportable students that equates to 24 one

31 enrollments it is a significant increase we it is a significant increase we have 8478 unduplicated students that being central campus itself is up ten and distance learning is up 133 we are coming close to matching the spring of 21 enrollments back in spring of 21 the enrollments were 24254 and as i said we are 24131 right

24254 and as i said we are 24131 right now that being said though we haven't reached census and as we get closer to census students sometimes drop and so that number may go down a little bit between now and census good report questions was that twelve increase was that year over-year or from fall to spring spring to

spring just the spring semesters comparing spring semesters comparing spring semesters yes ma'am when the enrollment start maybe starts to decline what measures do you have in place to follow up with the students that are choosing to withdraw we usually reach out to them in from student services to see where you know what we can do to help

them we have start dates every month so once census passes they can enroll in the next online or face-to-face session the following month but we do follow up with students that we lose and let letting them know that they have the support financial support also that is right okay support also that is right okay definitely anyone else

thank you man' you throughout the 89th legislative session you will see the legislative update as a placeholder on my report so that i can share with you in real time anything that is going on i will tell you that the tac organization along with the other community college presidents we will be meeting once a month to discuss

legislation being filed that impacts community colleges and we will then share with you anything of significance and so there bills are still being filed not much discussion but bills are still being filed and some of the more significant include of the more significant include senate bill 579 and what that the impact of that bill and it is

relating to an exemption from certain requirements regarding diversity equity and inclusion and so what it is looking to do is exemp privately funded scholarships from the dei provisions outline in senate bill seventeen which was enacted in during the 88th legislative session and so for as you have seen in the news and even here at central texas college

there was some fallout with that so that bill seeks to exempt private donations also and i identified this as a legislative priority during our last meeting for for teac senate bill 49 relating to the performance tier funding under public junior college state finance program they are looking to include independent colleges and universities of texas basically include private

universities because right now one of those performance measures are or outcomes as schools trans students who are transferring from the community college to a university but it is a public fouryear university is how it reads right now but as we know many students they attend private schools there was a subsequent bill filed that just added on to

that to include outof state universities so we will be tracking that pretty closely and there are a few others some language changes with regard to accrediting agencies initially there was some language in one of the bills that was specific to sachs but there was a change there is a proposed change to make it read any accrediting body

so we will keep an eye on those things something that is really interesting to note is that house bill 855 was yeah i do not know if i am reading that correctly anyway the proposed legislation is a constitutional amendment excuse me providing for the creation of funds to support the capital needs of educational programs offered by the

texas state technical system tstc and so with this the impact here is that it would establish a one five billion endowment for tstc and lamar state colleges allowing for an annual withdrawal from the fund of up to five with new limits on uses so we will be watching that one pretty closely also those are competitors also what

i'd like to talk about just brief you quickly you all have seen the the president's directive through the omb office regarding federal agencies directing federal agencies to temporarily pause the dispersement of grants and loans for federal financial assistance programs other than for social security medicare and other programs providing direct aid to individuals well as you can imagine

since that times there have been several questions i did receive a call because i am being asked questions but none of us at the community college or university level really know the full impact what i have provided you is a copy of that initial om letter and a subsequent q a that was released and that is something

that i was waiting on prior to coming to today's meeting so that you would have it real time so the q a is contained in pages three and four and one of the questions is this a freeze on benefits of americans like snap or student loans and the response is no any program that provides direct benefits to

americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process and then you can go on to read it so there are some exceptions i suspect this being somewhat fluid we will learn more as we go but i wanted to make sure you had that information today and i will keep you in my report nursing

endowed scholarship in december we had a donor who wishes to remain anonymous donate 100 zero to an endowed nursing scholarship for our students and so we are quite appreciative of that she is a former nurse herself i had an opportunity to not just give her a thank you card but to visit with her and express the our

appreciation collectively on behalf of the board and the administration and the students and faculty and staff of central texas college and i spent a wonderful afternoon with her it was it was it was really nice and so she appreciates the work that we are doing she says we are doing good work and she strongly believes in the

health sciences she said but in particular the sciences she said but in particular the nursing program we are thankful and i promised her a follow-up visit i think i made a friend six th anniversary planning we have a committee formed to plan our celebration of the college's 60th anniversary throughout the year so we are looking at a

series of events some of which will highlight alumni and donors and bring folks to our campus so more to come on that we we actually have some samples of a seal for this year so we will get that selected and we will start using that in some of our communications did you mention a date no well it

will be throughout the year unless you tell me to spend that kind to doug has a few dollar doug has a few dollars set aside for me but i do not think it'll cover and i and we are looking to do something a little more intimate throughout the year whereby we can throughout the year whereby we can

engage everyone any questions observations early on when you began speaking you said something about the scholarships privately established scholarships does that how does that affect the foundation in their distribution of those scholarships well this and you helped me out miss p as well as miss bricks we did have a few scholarships that we had to change the

language a little bit some schools had to eliminate scholarships alt together we did not have to do that miss pacon met with those donors whose scholarships were impacted by senate bill seventeen and they agreed to the language change the language changes that would bring us into compliance with senate bill seventeen it was not without some warm conversations

but they did and so we are still able to award those scholarships hopefully during this legislative session we can get that corrected because i believe that was really just an unintended consequence of that bill okay but in this with the scholarships that specifically say a race of that specifically say a race of people or to change it

you had to change it yes because i am thinking about mind and i think mind specifically said women and i need you to look at that take a look at that okay see i do not i do not believe so but i will double check it yes i will and if there but we have talked to everyone

that had specific groups wow miss pac and miss briggs did a really good job with that that is a lot thank you yeah and as the chancellor had mentioned there were some you know discussions that had to be made but they understood that it was not our decision or was not decision you know of course moving forward

but yeah it is amazing this is just one woman's opinion it is amazing that someone can tell me what to do with my money that is amazing to me i that does not happen to me very often the culture we live in anyone else next item business is discuss consider approval the november 24 and december 24 inter

financial statements and investment reports mr par i am going to skip to december since that is the latest month on your first page your statement of net position there is not a lot of discrepancies there mainly when your cash and investments and those wash out you will see that your unearned revenues have risen from have increased million

five from the same time last year that is always a good sign you are deferring the revenue but when that goes up it is a good sign on your second page i have left you with some explanations of those changes for taxes i want to wait to like march you that'll be a better indicator of where we

stand november december january february those are the big months where we collect so we really will not know the impact of what we did back in august until march did everybody understand my line item regarding tuition and fees if not i can explain that a little better please do okay so one difference between this year and last

year last year we were collecting the full tuition rate of 100 for fast and dual credit this year we are only able to charge 55 56 that difference we are not collecting so that is a difference between this year and last year and that kind of goes back to your question a couple of months ago in my

analysis it looks like you know this is my estimate we will need like 36 of those students from the fall to reach fifteen semester credit hours to break even on that lost revenue when they hit fifteen semester credit hours we will get 50 zero and we will need like 36 that is my estimate to break even and

anything after that is money so and i will be able to update you with that again probably around march for the spring it takes a while to for the spring it takes a while to for janelle to reconcile the numbers confirm them with the state that has to go through a process to see who is who we

can actually submit so it takes a little long so anyway your bottom line is a little less than this time last year but when you figure in the bonus and then when you figure in the lost revenue from the fast versus the tuition you are actually up and then with your investments you had a couple matured at

one and then that was replaced with one at like four two so that was a good maturity any questions about the november report there a motion to approve motion been made and seconded all in favor say i thank you all right what did you give us both november and december yes okay i am sorry that was my

mistake thank you item six discuss consider approval of board document 440 orderorder of election miss aens good afternoon i am bringing the order of election for upcoming board of trustees a general that it is going to be scheduled for may the three 2025 we have three positions opening with expiring six-year terms and then one special election for

an unexpired term the filing period is started last wednesday and it is open until february the 14th friday at 5m the order lists different polling 5m the order lists different polling locations throughout bill county and coral throughout bill county and coral county and this year coro county is not supporting us because they do not have an election

or the resources or person to support our election so i have been in contact with coer co isd and they are allowing us to use their district training facility for poing location where is the district polling location on sunny at the jun avenue at the junior 702 sunny avenue building at the junior 702 sunny avenue building 200

that is little way it is kind of like behind the stadium you could not that the boardroom available any other questions concerning that notice i thought our other option here that was i spoke with dr hawkins office and that is this report requires board action is there a motion so move motion seconded second motion made second any

other questions can we discuss now yeah i can discuss now okay so in corel county in the ccsd section of corel county because those are the eligible voters for the for board of trustees there is about roughly about 27 28 zero registered voters in that school district and and i heard what you said about them they could

all just come up here that is a lot of people potentially usually you probably see between 500 and a th000 people come out on election time we prefer it be a lot more yeah and we are the only ones having concerning the junior high area where that one location is that is a traffic problem and to be

able to get in and out of that area unless you know where you are going you will miss it every time i think i know where mr armstrong was trying to describe where it was at and stuff but and stuff but is yeah it is at the south end kind of runs parallel to robertson avenue there is

a little exit from the junior high from the stadium it is right as you make that exit i believe it is the building to the left if the kids are on the move from class times or coming or going then it'll be very hard to get through that as a non-student or a bus person it'd be crazy

if it is a if we can discuss you know with the school district may be a better location that is a problematic location in my opinion we can certainly go back to the school district miss havens has had a number of conversations with the school district and this was the best they were able to offer if you

want us to go back and find another location we'd have to be prepared to pay but it is whatever you want the u the oh miss briggs would like to say something yes the other thing is the discussion about the location is absolutely relevant i am not trying to stop that however miss havens has a deadline for

calling the election and that is really the item that is before you and i do not the deadline would be before the next meeting correct yeah the 14th of february is the last date of call so if you have a problem with the location i i am not saying that you cannot but what i am saying is

i would make a i would recommend that today you pass the order and we can always come back and amend locations later but we have to call the election before february 14th we' recommend that over tabling if we table it you table it to your next regular meeting after the deadline so yes my recommendation is that you

pass the order calling the election with that location that miss havens has secured for now if she is able to change it we can bring back an amendment to the locations but we have to call the election itself before february fourteen right we have i call the question been call for all in favor say i any been

call for all in favor say i any oppos no okay motion passed thank you next item is discussing consider approval of dr tina a zero as vice chancellor a meritus of instruction and chancellor a meritus of instruction and workforce initiatives good afternoon we we have our meritus policy that states individuals are eligible after they have completed a

year a year after they' retired i cannot believe it is already been a year since dr has left so i am here today to request that designation for her she was with the institution for over 25 years is there a motion to approve motion approve motion been made seconded discussion questions all in favor say i you item

assessment report and do not see a need for any kind of action to be presented for this anything for the good of the board from board members any kind of recommendations for future events yes i had a couple of encounters with students and faculty and i know we spent some money on hvac improvements and door locks and

i just want maybe we can have a review of the status how's it going what i had heard was there is some classrooms that are pretty cold and some folks that could not necessarily get into their classrooms so if we could have a the folks give us a rundown on the status of that improvement we sir charles
