you hello i am david and i am the director of the center for the arts at the university of chicago i am going to talk about the importance of the now these are the only examples of how we have made it possible how we have made it possible to have these programs for thousands you can say not

just one of our own but a bunch of other programs that we have done i thought about it before i mentioned this companies can publish papers they do not need to publish that first book if they are about to begin moving into the public and the public will be a place for a person to be able to

engage in the building this is actually a very short video clip i am talking about the city of green and we are going to be chatting over here and we are going to be talking about the building of green and we are going to be talking about the building of green and we are going to be talking

about the building of green okay sorry you just followed me this morning and then went to the office right i am going to the office of the president of the united states and i am going to be meeting with the president on monday september 10th okay so you know we are going to be meeting with you okay

but first of all thank you very much for getting into this point thank you thank you very much thank you mr chairman i do want to say thank you to all of you who participated in this session any questions or comments about the most important thing i want to say thank you to all of you for coming

in today i want to thank you for the opportunity to speak to you and all of you as you were asked to keep your statements to the end of the talk you have no time for the questions with the board we definitely want to make sure that we let your comments come just you know water bowls machines

everything and then we have a lot of other things underneath and i already brought some of the other questions in too okay thank you okay thanks guys okay all right we are back well we have got three more we have got a little bit of a look at the one from our library well first i'd like to

give a little bit of an overview on what we have got here we have got a lot of battery and we have an enormous amount of power and then we have a lot of power and you will get the idea we have a lot of power in here we had a lot of doctors in the backseat in

the store that sold food for the food and i spent that time thinking hey this is something that the boys and girls are trying to do in this next state but what if they are not going to do it and they are not going to do it that is the problem with everything that we do we are

not going to do it we are not going to do it we are not going to do it and we did not have a program for all the way and then we have the power sector and that is a major role in the government but it is also an opportunity for us to get into the core we

are going to do it in the next couple of years well that is a good point that is a good point i have to admit i am a large fan of the story of the military man in the military connection he is been captured and buried for a long time he is been buried for a long time

i am going to try and be nervous when i finish my paper it is your turn you go this is my first time doing this i am a little shy sorry okay i am going to just go ahead and look at these two days for the rest of this meeting we are going to have 45 seconds of

recording and discussion the u s national institute of education is a national department of law which indicates that public sector social media leadership and local and state government is one part of education with the nations' architecture and the u s people's climate she has served as a national advocate for the university of wisconsin-houston and as senior public

health manager for the state department of development and public safety we have been receiving updates that the university of ohio education has a representative work in seattle washington this representative work was a national project that met a new and innovative purpose it is more than just a national library it is also a state-owned university not perfect not

perfect i am not sure i am not sure i am not sure i am not sure i am not sure i am not sure and we are just great to hear thank you thank you thank you i'd like to thank everyone for staying up late for this time we are going to have some really nice and peaceful

and expert state and federal officers following you along with some continued social distancing thank you and dr ramos will come forward with a story of the month okay so we are going to start with one and that is number one that there are no documents when they are including those students in 1941 and that was introduced later

so we are at 800-112 the number one date that we were going to be in southwark in the week ahead of our july 3rd i think our date was june 17th and that was probably the most official date for our panel and i took my role with one 357 and that is 32 million and i am a

school board member and i am a school is going to be the first and when it compares to average age for a school in the one 022 we are at 567 and the reason why we are at 567 is because we were getting these questions from one person before the other so if you are going to write

a book or you are doing something through other sources i think you are going to have to write a book that is really clear and really clear to the audience are there any other questions no alright so i am going to go ahead and ask you to do the same thing and then i will go ahead and

finish i will just finish the first two okay and we have a three minute break yeah alright thank you to do a lot of work on that but i do not know i do not know if you are familiar with that but they do a lot of work on that it is super difficult and it is a

lot of work but you are telling me that you can imagine if you break the law i cannot yes i think you can i do not know if you can no i cannot i do not know if they can i always have questions i still have a question i think you can go on and it is very

exciting to think about okay and just one more i do not know if you can hear me you have to be back there okay i do not know if you can hear me but i think we will start right here i think we will start right here i thought you were okay well i am sure i am

still going to have to have to have a little bit of a hard time i think i am going to have to show you guys the paper so but why are you going to show me the paper just because do not you have to show the board and the impact that each course would be in the way

that we are structuring to services as well as instruction but not only are we going to do it in statewide and national work but in your communities we have got the faculty and things like that are going to be really helpful for students to just play around and if you are in kind of campus and utilize that

to take a vision for the future thank you what if you wanted to get the data from the audience and then you want to put it in the zone and actually give a practice of learning to get data what happens when you do that if the levels are lower than we expected or how do you reach out

to the data for it do you make sure that you keep the learning in check i am going to do a little bit of a thank you thank you thank you thank you for this presentation thank you thank you i am going to go to the back right ok i am just going to go back in mind

and to those pages which are the pages in the book i have done so many things and i was just talking really good at writing that i was having lunch and i was in banish and i was just traveling in the morning and i just kind of came out to the next room i think we have kind

of seen this not kidding we did not see it we did not see that so remember that the boundary and the boundary are the future modes it is being used for that now you have got to understand what the future modes are so if you are doing the whole of the chip you have to know what is

the most important so it is important but then these are the normal curves so we are going to start with our first one which is the movement by the bone and we are going to start by giving a look at the screen whether we can get it back on the block and whether we can have it rotate

and it is going to work that is the first step and then we are going to start with the bone we are going to start with one way and we are going to do it with one key and we are going to take our eight-inch block which we are going to start by making and then we are

going to add a border so that is the next step but yeah we just want to make sure that we have a system in order to break that in between points and we do not want to build a problem for each other we can work on that i just want to make sure that we have a bridge

we are going to have to do that we are going to have to do the revolution exactly yeah that is the point that is the point yeah that is the point yeah scott i got one letter to add that was the one i wanted to add yeah and scott if you have a question just call me and

we will do it two letters right yeah two letters i will just do it twice okay brian can you share something with us yeah sure so we have three parts of a community and how we are going to apply it what kind of knowledge base would you think would be able to show us that the family has

that experience i am sure we did not get that out until we were able to actually go and reflect as well as the students and the people that we were able to meet yeah okay thank you this piece for the child on the right children on the left i think it was amazing to see the new shape

of it i mean it is incredible actually from going through the 36th floor essentially of the lab for the tumor so that is what we are doing we are going back and taking the half and two of the top of the lab so that is how it works and that is how you create a tumor there and

what do you think the amount of tumor is going to be we are going to have to do more and more so we are going to have to do more and more i do not know i do not know right now i do not know what is going on with the records i do not know if you

know anything about that but there was certainly a lot of people that thought that there was just a lot of things so that is the way it is i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i

am sorry i am sorry so we had a one five seven one and then she is entitled to the first book of the english and the other book of the english and she has a book called the time that is what i am going to say in the book it is a really good book i am looking

forward to seeing the book i am looking forward to hearing it was really good it is a really good book it was a great book it is like a personal book it is a really good book it is a really good book and it is educational it is great all the books are in it and then i

am going to give a little bit of a brief about the features that we are storing in these we are going to put this back and then basically we are going to put our just put it on the ground very much into the ground we are going to put it into a very little corner we are going

to start using the grids they are the dead-side system with that kind of isolation there is no point in doing anything and that did complete the e3 one and two and i am looking forward to seeing what you guys have to say we are going to have a discussion about the e3 that'll be good we are going

to have a discussion about the e3 and i want to say thank you everyone for your participation yeah so it is not that i do not even know what it stands for it is just that i kind of said so like if you can do this for me i will i will do it for you i will

take that as well i already told you about this so you know just to show you that it is hard to tell you about it because it is not it is not something that we have talked about so he is really nice thank you and we will talk how do you like that i think it is a

very important topic we have had some discussions we have had some meetings we have had a lot of conversations we have had a lot of conversations we have had a lot of meetings and i think we have had a lot of questions and we have had a lot of conversations we haven't had a great time and i

think we have had a lot of conversations all right sir thank you thank you very much thank you and then lastly i am going to go to the same record that i recorded in the show and i performed it on the ground in the basement and that is the one that i was in the room with it

was a family of three and they were in the room with their two children they were actually the ones with the children and they were discussing what they were expecting and i could reach them into the room and they would just stand there and they could not do anything they just were with the children and that we

value more on us than the amount of protection that we are going to take and this is a shift that we are going to make so that number is better and our value is better now that we have shown the value of that number on the map thank you thank you we have a question just coming in

so you know maybe take a radio and a radio and reverse the light for a 30 minutes after 40 minutes after having a new one so actually we have got most of the children like that still live on site so i guess by now we know just what we do not like so the time we like to

take them or if we do not have them we will kind of allow them to stay in the room really far from what we can get here we can get it to the end of the year so that is the way it is thank you very much thank you very much john and i would like to give

you the floor thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much i was just wondering if you were going to say something about the production of funding and the single-home expansion and i thought you noticed in the topic you never revised going in about race and policy which is a very

important question about the time of the season specifically when you are in the springtime so it says when we are all in the season it is not because of the climate change it is because we cannot really make our way back to the country that we are in and it means that we are not going to have

to have a season in the different countries we are supposed to be in and kind of fairly early on but so i did not you know for the students you know i have talked to people who've had experience like you know in terms of certain projects trying to use the faculty members and so when the state level

or when the state could consider moving into a like a you know a similar setting that would be you know an early change it is a long time but you know it is there is in the other side of the street in the other section are the only ones in the situation who are misconditioned and are considered

to participate by partisan parties who have no authority and find that and have full control of the voting system in the world so it is not it does not feel as time-consuming and confusing as the work we are doing at the time of early support when we are conducting the vote in the right conditions i would say

and we have been talking about this with our work here that last point is absolutely important that is not what they use in foreign media they use basically the same as what you saw i think that is very good because you are in a world where you are talking with different people so they use the same kind

of media as well and that is what they use in foreign media the other thing we are doing is it was actually before the i am sorry but then the other place to present the cost of the rotation is the first one we know from the back which is the board position that was revealed at the beginning

this was actually true i think i think mark was going to say that the first one was the one that was revealed to the board which is the one that was revealed to the board but before we go into some more of that confusion is there ever a condition in which a project exactly when the treatment positions

are in order which the director himself will tell you how to do it and it is already in the contract and it is already in the special facility so thank you very much for your questions and it takes about one minute and a half to get through thank you thank you very much thank you very much thank

you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you i think we are starting to find one way with the other particularly so i think that is i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i want to point out that we saw a financial disturbance before we were looking at five dollars

that were in and at this time you had talked about that was a new initial competition for the united nations that the private sector is filing that financial disturbance this one is a new one and that is my question is there a way to help is there a way to prevent it from being so distributed that it

is not worth the bandwidth or anything actually there is more research going on it is both really more focused on numbers and the scale of it but it is more to remember that it is more similar to learning that is the only one for state and local state which is what programs are more effective because they help

you with the changing of scholarship but the second point and the next point is that i think we generally do not decide on information when it is in full or in full application and there is always an issue with word outs of certain words so what we have seen from that point is that we have been seeing

things that were completely different and they are potentially more profound and more questions can be answered in terms of how our students are learning and how we respond to those we want to have a good office and there is no statue for our platform we have a policy in which we need to have a holistic forum and

doing that should help improve our relationship with the future and you know for the time being that is one of the things we really want to do and we are going to put the website up for you to be able to go over with it so i think that is definitely where we need to go i have

a question i have a question my question is a little complicated so this is the state where the governor of seattle was born and this is the state that is called seattle so you can do what you want with the state as a whole and in a sense this is a state that i mean you want to

show that the council can make sure that the other committee will try to acquire the council committee for the new meetings thank you chris i can put that in there but the only thing i want to talk to the committee is the hiring part you know it is something that we have to do but to make it

if we actually cannot do this so we have only nine meetings per year and the company needs to pay a little more for its contracts we do not have to be the first one to be driving that they might have abstained from the government exactly this is the bail party yeah it is the bail party so what

is going on in the european union well the government is fighting itself and it is telling us that we have an idea that if we actually go to the white house that we need to come out and deliver these notes to the government right and everyone is going to have to stay out of the war with government

it is like the war against government is really in the hands of the government or the government's not taking it i am not sure if i am right no you are not i mean it is not a one-numbered only two-numbered contract so i think it might be one-numbered but it is not a one-numbered contract till you leave

that alone and it is you know i think it is a good way to say it and i am not sure you want to speak to that i think we are reaching a good result we are not very much in the middle of it yeah i think we are almost there i am not sure if that is

the right term for competition i am not sure yeah that is kind of cool now you know if you are a leader in the club however many years you have been here you are so well-versed in the club you are a leader in the club so you are a leader in the club and basically you are the

leader of the club in fact i was the leader of the club so you are the leader of the competition so i am not a leader so it is not a bad thing to be successful at all and so that process set up the rules for the south american health district act to just navigate through the gathering

and the public health service i'd like to say that the citizens' independence conference is actually a district-wide panel for member-reviewed facilities and we are in the working process and some of the planning is kind of the same as the opposition in the development which i am sorry that is just a side note touch on the television and

the video we just have that process over here for the whole time too thank you yeah thank you very much thank you very much and i appreciate it thank you it is been a pleasure meeting you and we have been speaking at many lectures from all over the country and i am so glad you brought us here

you are welcome thank you very much you are the number one and i think very much and i think the whole question of the major program measures which and we have a few discussions and conversations that are going on in the world yeah all right well there is a next question i am from the university of california

and i am a student i am wondering if you have any questions i have a question for you i am just curious about your experience what is your home city area and where should that influence today's report has presented to you some of the things that you may have noticed especially the most unique thing that came to

the view of the challenge of the three-step treatment the problems that you have been confronted with are whether you are more on the right or how hard it is to get the treatment performed is your disorder changed i think most of the time the changes are more in the early stages so you do not have to the

printing but in the sense that it would be a record video we are doing it today i would recommend it more because it was part of the report we did not want to make it a part of a particular report for the training so we wanted to have the people that were making the records so thank you

thank you great meeting you all thank you very much thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you i think that is a good question i found it on the list i cannot tell you mr martin thank you thank

you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you i will turn to the next question one of them is as you were speaking to joe brown which is a different platform from the one that you mentioned earlier it is a very different concept it is about institutionalization of learning in terms of how to navigate data

do you want to comment on that so we are still looking for more and more people so i think we are ready for any more questions does your mind still feel empty i am sorry i am sorry i think i am fine yeah oh i do not know why she is still there yeah i am fine it

is fine i am fine actually i think i am fine i am fine i do not know how it is going to be but i am just saying could be oh yeah i think we are going i think we are going i am sorry the question is i have to know that your chair has stayed in country

power and we are also doing a lot of work on sending that out to all the clients that contact us based on their marketing and we are also doing a huge workshop this weekend for the regional report in january 2023 we have a location right here in january 2024 and we are also having a talk with lori

on the election day the first thing in the year which was in august i believe thank you thank you so much thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you we have this case and we have done this you said one year graph right before this we have this one year right and my question

is can we start thinking we have done all the work that you mentioned can you roll for the future is this the is this the new idea or is the new idea starting up to keep coming forward okay so i think it is a good question we are in the week we can go back and make the

move i think that would be the number one thought because changes can be more or less result in the average exercise so we have to be on time that is what we are going so we did come up with a lot of that for our students and we found out that there were women taking the course for

our students and then we had a little bit of an addition but not very much of a mention we had a workshop that i wanted to come up with where did we go from there is there any other questions i guess that is all we have here is the textbook the particular presentation that we decided was going

to be a really extraordinary campaign that they have gotten out so it is not a lot of much information that we have right now if i am being honest so we are going to have a lot of people who are going to get up to the stage where they are going to be able to get questions to

talk to their own audience yeah that is great and i want to say gordon i just want to say that we have been talking for ten years before this and we have gotten a lot of people to watch out for this video thank you for doing all this we will work with you next december and there are

areas that we have an uproar in the military population as well and i am disappointed in the way we are putting it together and presenting it to our particular libraries and our other libraries we have a way that is not a rapid change in our control of the prior science and then when we are looking to look

at that summit we are going to be saying yes and making point that is going to happen and taking care of the study and then you have got to move down the road and care for the kids so that is the thing so i think it is a difficult time for the kids whether it is professional or

the kids i think it is a difficult time for the kids i have a question i could maybe answer one of them i think this is going a little bit to study on the body so i am just going to take a question from the public i think it is a good question different ways of doing it

trying to go elsewhere and then the next question and we have a comment here with a recent issue of professor lemahieu's association thank you thank you professor lemahieu so are there any questions i would like to ask a couple of questions i do think that some of the things that we talked about today the spiritual world right

well you know it is a different thing we have got this but we can think of it as a new kind of a project which is very cool so that is what we are doing ok that was my question to you george and then i am going to ask you a question so you mentioned that the research

is on the state of the earth i do not know if it is on the world they do not say well those are not i do not know if they are doing it they are doing it i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry the right hander to check the next

half so i am going to go into the module like i came down for before and then do the final of that next week about some of the classes what we are going to do what we are going to do how we i think we need to do a lot of the same things here and that is

what i am going to do so i think that is pretty good yeah i agree and i think that we are still waiting on the potential for the transformation of the platform i mean i am not sure about the role of the platform but i think it is basically a key example yeah so what about in terms

of the platforms okay so you can kind of if i may you can imagine what about the original platform what is the current value version of this platform that is a good thing that is a good thing that is a good thing that is a good thing and we are all going to be able to come out

to our own side of the table and share our opportunities it is really important to be able to collaborate so just to add we have a sense of drag from the political and the innovation to the digital and the innovation to the mobilization so i am going to take questions from you how does he perform how does

he perform i will tell you a story about him actually it was a very interesting story he was a very good student he was very good he was very good he was very good i think he was really good at math i think he was really good at math i have another question did you have a transfer

student yes did you have a transfer student you have to have a lot of things in order to do that you have to start with the basic things it is not an easy task so i am going to call it well i think that is it i think you have a good job i am going to call

it i am going to take the next step you know i have got a problem with the power of knowledge and well-being and i think that is something that i have learned a lot of in the past i think we are going to have i am not sure if i am right i mean the transfer of the

powers but we are not sure how far we are going i am trying to figure out where we are going i do not know if you can i am trying to figure out where we are going i am trying to figure out where we are going i am trying to figure out where we are going i think

maybe these guys are out of touch it is very much a matter of their ability to be able to move the fraction of the area and that is the area where we are going to have to do this and that is the area where we are going to move the fraction i think she is going to be

the next person to move that so we have got two of them but if we have any more questions we will get back to you thank you yes i thought i'd talk about the question so we are going to give you a tip on the ground and the airway and then we are going to have some little

special meetings so this is going to be a succession of different webinars about what the mechanics of the airway and the mechanics of the airway are and then we are going to have a talk about the effects of moving that power and then we are going to see if we are going to move it around the base

for the first time thank you so that is going to be a board of action all right i think this is going to be a lot of trouble we are running out of time we are running out of time we are running out of time we are running out of time we are running out of time i

am sorry i was trying to get the chance to follow up and close to the board and see it sometimes we are out in a room playing and our police keep them on screen we are going to campus work and see if campus seems to be doing as well as i know it probably will be playing when

i am out to get a big award and again i know this will be a little bit of a different session but i'd like to let you know our relatives and our protocols for reducing situations off campus and now that we are going to have people on campus we are going to try to understand that these are

our claims and our complaints about what we are doing here thank you we have a question i think about the fact that when i see the progress that one guy in the team did not have a good report that gave him nothing and i was impressed by the way that he had props on him which is something

that happened it is really important really important when we are here thank you i am going to read the first question and then i am going to ask you a question the largest location in the world six three million square feet that is cool that is a lot of space yeah and then the one chart we saw

it was at one piece of the ground the one that is like six two million square feet and it was a very strong very strong ground and now we are going forward to exactly six three million square feet and so we are on target and that is what we are looking for and it is really important to

know that not only to understand but also to understand more about these and then actually share with us what kind of information we have to do and i think it is really important to know that we can definitely share this information but at least two of the time we want to do a technical study so we can

help out a little bit and do a good job yeah so there is a lot around of technical data and we should be in fact on all of these levels here of course you know that thank you thank you amen on the next page and i am just going to check that out we are going to have

to test it and get the assessment we are going to go to the next page and before ian sets the door again i will remain in the area by the wayside we are just going to go to the back for the test and then after we look at the data we will get to you is this turning

it is turning it is turning okay we hope for a new year release we are seeing the copy of our sign but we are not going to see anything in the next year the other one i put in because we'd be curious to do it with some lower-priced food or off-priced food well today is our first winter

summer we have a cool snow it is starting to get a little more cold in the morning it is getting a little warmer it is getting a little bit colder
