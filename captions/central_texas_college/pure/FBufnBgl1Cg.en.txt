month dr garrett presented our census day texas enrollment and today i am going to present the worldwide and our texas enrollment as you can see in your board package it yes okay you will see that for the course enrollment we are starting to trend up in 20125 our worldwide course enrollment was 24 27 and then if you

look at our head count you also see that we are trending up there as well our worldwide was 8861 are there any questions anyone thank you all you okay the army 250th birthday during the last month's lunch in you heard general admiral speak about that so i just wanted to remind everyone that event is june 13th friday

june 13th they have limited tables and seatings so if we if you plan to attend please let us know so that we can purchase the one or two tables that we may need those tables range from 900 to one 200 depending on location so please let us know as soon as possible so that we can secure the

tables for you por is it going to be held the clean center legislative update so at the federal level the reauthorization of the workforce opportunity and innovation act is currently in progress it was actually in a bill this past december there was a bill to continue to extend fundy through fiscal year 2025 and it is a bipartisan

piece of leg legislation but for whatever reason it was removed so both sides of the aisle have picked it up again everyone's in agreement that we need to pass it what is what is in what is critical about this particular piece of legislation is that it codifies the strengthening community college training grants program which allows which provides

funding opportunities for community colleges to modernize training programs and to upskill adult and dislocated workers so we continue to follow that also on the federal level the contin the current continuing resolution as you know is expired to is set to expire on march 14th and so while we have not received a formal notification there is a message

that was put out on army ignited for the service members which basically says that if a continuing resolution or budget is not passed that the current ta that was approved with an effective date of march 15th and later those ta requests will be cancelled so hopefully we will get we will get something accomplished there in washington so

that does not happen on the state level so the community college sector the priorities for this legislative session include a supplemental appropriations bill in the amount of 89 million to fund the community colleges for the current bm the one that we are in because community colleges have exceeded the expectations of hba the outcomes associated there with and

so there is a proposal from the coordinating board to allocate additional funds for the current bm which ends in august we are also so another priority is the obviously the full fully funding the outcomes based funding model through the general corporations act and i previously mentioned to you that senate bill one and house bill one look very

similar at this time and prayerfully will it will remain that way but that is another priority of the community colleges and the what is been what is been appropriated proposed anyway is in alignment with what the coordinating board asked so if it is approved then we will have the funding that we believe we need and then of

course and i mentioned this piece of legislation a couple of months ago but it is a priority for us and that is to include independent and private universities and the transfer performance tier of hb8 several tax bills relevant in miss briggs you jump in and help me at any time several tax bills relevant to community colleges were

filed no real activity as of yet but there is one that was filed where whereby any election for a tax rate greater than the voter approval rate to be approved has to be approved by 60 of the voters then there is another one that requires 2third majority on elections to issue bonds or increased taxes and there are

several others but at this time no activity so the last day of file bills is this friday march 14th all committee assignments have been made so after the 14th we will pay much closer attention more so than we have already v if that is possible miss briggs right but just to see what if any of those bills

gain traction and we will you and that concludes my update sir thank you any board members have thank you any board members have questions chancellor next item is we are going to hear about a large format flatbed hear about a large format flatbed cutting table good afternoon everybody my name is bobby waddle the instructor for the graphics

and printing technology program under industrial technology before you today for your consideration is approval to purchase the colex sharp cut pro cutting table using 2425 carl perkins grant funds using a state of texas purchasing cooperative this equipment will allow our students to be able to fulfill the complete package of sign manufacturing last year we were able to

purchase with grant funds the flatbed printer this year i am requesting to purchase the cutter that goes with it so what it does is it allows the students to operate equipment that'll make them give them career opportunities with twenty 25 an hour jobs just starting operating these types of equipment in the s manufacturing field things they will

be able to work with is cutting wood acrylic aluminum large 4x8 foot signage not just small tabletop signage so it expands their opportunities to see better paying jobs the manufacturing field is huge and sign manufacturing is a part of that not just the typical construction trades you know sign manufacturing is a big part of that so that

is my request for you today you said this is for a grant yes what is 610 that is for one year and parts later yes parts training accessories service and freight we have estimate on the out years for like parts and maintenance and spies on that we estimate as far as parts is very minimal the ink or

not ink the blade accessories a couple hundred dollars to replace but we would not have to replace them every year here and as far as maintenance it is 800 to get someone to come out and maintenance the machine but that is if we need the maintenance a lot of the training will cover us to be able to

maintain the machine ourselves i am trying to wrap my head around a 100 zero table i am sorry yeah so the table it just cuts giant four by8 foot sheets so when you buy when we buy wholesale material like wood aluminum and acrylic it comes in sheets it does not come in small because the way you know

the manufacturing business works we do not they do not make the small things automatically we have to cut everything down ourselves no does it cut like square corners or does it cut in like a you need a rounded or it cut all custom kinds of cuts we can make any shape we want we can make the logo

we can make corner cuts round cuts any cut you want and that is what the students get to learn is how to design the correct measurements to create these cuts and they are operating the table to make the cuts precise into the specs that the customer orders how many students do you currently have in the program we

have 70 students currently and usually every semester we maintain that 70 student enrollment chancellor's travel right okay the travel my travel schedule was updated to include the fourth quarter travel the standard teac and sac cooc but also i was recently nominated and selected to attend the army war college first week of june the national security seminar really

excited about that so i have added that as well and the budget all right so for the fiscal year 26 budget the mr barton sent out the documents to the departments for review and submission by may one we are doing something different this year we have added another layer of review to the process to help the administration

better prioritize major initiatives and purchases it will also save mr barton some time and building the budget so we are looking at doing a lot of this work on the front end with the senior administr and executives so what we are doing is in addition to in addition to tying all new initiatives to the strategic plan we

are also incorporating the use of grants so one of the things that we are doing is a more strategic approach to the use of perkins funds to support instructional cte programs so this it is going to take a bigger a broader conversation at the leaders ship level but we are confident that this will be a much smoother

process in building the budget also with the new process we are incorporating salary increases at the beginning what that actually looks like is will depend ultimately on where we where we where we are partway through the process but we heard you loud and clear with regard to salaries for our employees and while we are we are still

not where we want to be i think the important thing is that we make steps to get there and so we will we will do that as opposed to waiting to the end to see if we can afford to give an increase we are incorporating that at the beginning the exacts are still in the works though so

i just wanted to give you that update again the submissions are due to mr barton by may one and u so you will hear from him during the maine thank you ma' now you also have a maine thank you ma' now you also have a resolution yes okay so as stated in your packet the community college association

of texas trustees is asking texas community college governing boards to demonstrate excuse me their support for the legislative priorities that i just mentioned during my legislative update this was something they came up with and the majority of the colleges have adopted the resolution and really it is just a show of support so i am bringing that for
