so and i encourage you to honor the three minute limit seeing none hearing none we move on to the next thing which is the chancellor's report good afternoon everyone thank you sir legislative update on the federal level we continue to monitor the administration's goal to close the us department of education and so along with other institutions across

our country our immediate concern is obviously the continuation of federal funding for our students and so in a letter dated march 14th i am not sure if you are aware of it mr james burgaron the acting under secretary of the us department of education assured education stakeholders that continuity of operations for the federal student aid federal student

aid is both a statutory and critical function of the department he also stated that the current reduction in force efforts do not impact employees working on core functions of the free application for federal student aid or student loan servicing programs and according to the letter funding administered by the office of post-secary education for community colleges and various

other programs would continue the reduction in force does not impact the critical functions of the office of career technical and adult education which admin administers the career and technical education program required by the carl d perkins career and technical education act so we will continue to monitor what is happening there in washington as it unfolds but that

is the update on a state level at the state level as of march 14th last friday before last excuse me the dead which was the deadline for filing bills with the 89 during the 89th texas legislative session excuse me a total of eight 898 bills and joint resolutions were filed that is about 1500 more than the previous

session so we can probably expect lots of activity house bill 500 i will just highlight a couple of bills house bill 500 this bill appropriates the full 89 500 zero that the texas higher education coordinating board requested for additional funding for public junior colleges in the current bienium so the funding that was passed with the 88th legislative

session for the 2425 school years there is an additional funding request house bill 2110 and its companion bill senate bill 1786 would make some technical adjustments to the language of the original of house bill eight and so this particular bill will also allow i had previously talked to you all about a bill that would allow transfer to

private and independent universities to be included in the funding formula or the funding outcomes excuse me so this bill these two bills actually wrap that up in the language as well so we call they are calling it the cleanup bill you know senate bill 2529 and its companion bill house bill 5303 this is another one of the

tax bills that was filed by the deadline and it increases the voting threshold required for a governing body to adopt an advorum tax rate exceeding the voter approved rate or to issue general obligation bonds requiring at least 60 approval for bonds and 80 approval for tax rate increases and then again the this what is specific about this

is a rate above the voter approval rate and that concludes my approval rate and that concludes my update questions comments next item is to consider and approve the february 2025 interim financial statement investment report mr president okay so on your first page your main differences there within your investments and your accounts receivable your accounts receivable difference there

has probably been cleared up by now if i ever rerun these again the question came up a while back about what is the difference between a short and long-term investment and it is the maturity if it matures within a year it is a short term if it is over a year it is considered longterm any anytime you

see some short or long-term line item on there that is usually the reason why that is easy on your second page same differences as last month next month i will try and get the spring fast and dual credit numbers and show you how that is affecting your bottom line so your bottom line's still pretty good and as

you know come may through august we will need a good bottom line because that is when it starts to dry up your investments there were no new or expired ones at the very bottom section at the far right you see the change in rates those are starting to consistently come down now whereas before you saw changes in

short and long now they are short and long rates so we will see you will see a difference at the end of the year in your investment income line item because of those rate decreases i will second okay all right who made the motion he did he said he had a question i had a question i thought

you made the motion i do not mr pierce made the motion mrs coley mr pierce made the motion mrs coley seconded there we go thank you i just i was looking at the numbers the pel looking at the numbers the pel grants we are looking about ten million if something goes wrong at the pel grant at the

federal level how would that affect us as far as i am cutting yes i haven't read where they are but i am just saying what is our in effect if it is cut well it would it would it would affect your students number one i mean they would not be able to receive the award and we would

not be able to apply it to tuition around about ten million i haven't i haven't heard a number okay i haven't i haven't heard where they are going to cut back i understand i just i was just asking how would what would be the impact if it if they did it'd probably be big i mean yeah as

big as tail is to the to the institution any other questions comments i do not think that it would they would necessarily cut it at least that is the scuttlebutt as they say but i think that they could delay it and that would cause us some difficulty think that yes that could because the way it works is

we we let the students register and then we draw the funds down after the fact so if they delayed it yes that would that could cause i mean we would record that we erode it and i am assuming that they would pay but it could be like the the military system a year or two ago where it

took them a while to pay yes ernest was your question about how much it would cost us if is that what you is that where you are going with that i think he kind of he answered the question and it was i was just going to have some framework any questions there is been a motion and a

second all in favor say i next item dr carter you have a motion for us about your travel schedule yes sir as as presented at the workshop earlier this month i have added three trips the army war college for the national security seminar the tax summer meeting and sacoc summer institute so at this time i am requesting

your approval for those trips okay anyone have questions of the chancellor is there a motion to approve request motion approved second motion made and seconded all in favor say i thank you next item miss w the cutting machine sharp cut because it is got dr carr's name on it also that is what confused me that is my

excuse we will get back to you dr talk to us now okay document 444 during the workshop i briefly discussed the resolution that the texas association the community college association of texas trustees is asking each governing body to sign to express their support for our legislative priorities during this session and so i am seeking your approval for

a signature questions about that do you have to give them any money to let us play no ma'am i move that we give there is a motion to approve this resolution second all in favor say i thank you all very much now miss wadd come back join us again well i am dr melissa gonzalez last well two

weeks ago miss waddle came before you asking for your consideration for the purchase of a sharp cut i am sorry a sharp cut pro model format flatbed cutting table for the graphics and printing program i am here for you to say yes if you so desire looking for your approval is everybody in your department that happy about

i like to think so i do not just mean this item just in life no i like to think they are we listen i have two awesome teams i cannot say enough about the men and women who work in industrial technology and office technology they make the college and me look pretty okay so i am happy to

represent to ask for what it is they need we discussed this in the workshop last week and how all that equipment works is there a motion to approve so move second motion been made and seconded all in favor say i thank you ma'am miss havens you want to talk to us about elections does not want to but

the first item is a list of the election judge doris mccra and the two poll workers or alternate judges dorothy mcclendon and carol riley he will be supporting us in the corell county congress and i bring this to your approval is there a motion to approve this request motion to approve motion made second any discussion questions if

we do not vote for it we do not have an election so all in favor say i thank you next all in favor say i thank you next item the next item is an order of election that i am have to bring back to the board for clarification in the original order i had a polling location here

located on campus for voters that will be on the base three precincts that we share with kissd due to due to a lot of different factors working with bell county and the city of ken and city of parker heights bell county has suggested that we close down do not have the polling location on campus and those voters

in those three precincts will go to copper cove and then i also added the time early voting times for each location that we will have and they are in alignment with the city of and rights which we have a copy of yes questions have those individuals in that precinct gone but we thought you know with the number

of voters out there the least amount of disruption to the voters would be going there and to keep the integrity of the election because the polling locations do not talk to each other there is no bill county cannot get corell county and them to talk so they thought this would be the best they thought this would be

the best option other questions go so u with that being said are they going to do the well are we going to advertise in the fort cavazos sentinel is that what they call it still the newspaper we have at fort kavazos i have to so that so that they would know i have to post the notice of

election that will list all the polling locations and that is due in the paper by next april 3rd i believe but i mean is it going to be in the for kavazo's paper also besides the colleen daily paper also besides the colleen daily herald no i can check into that i do not i do not know that

i thought the herald controls that yeah it is a sub part other questions i do not think we have had a motion is there a motion to approve this request for revising the board document 440 so move second motion made and second all in favor say i made and second all in favor say i thank you item

eleven mr gains as he comes to speak to this one let me just for transparency and clarification at the workshop we went into executive session to discuss this particular item the nature of its security was significant that the board felt we need to talk about it behind closed doors and we did and now mr gains brings it
