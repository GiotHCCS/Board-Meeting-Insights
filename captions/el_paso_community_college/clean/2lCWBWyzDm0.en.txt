[00:02:37 - 00:02:37] do i need to do
[00:02:51 - 00:02:58] aha okay all right um
[00:03:00 - 00:03:00] and just so you guys
[00:03:00 - 00:03:01] know there's a lot going
[00:03:01 - 00:03:01] on in the market right
[00:03:02 - 00:03:03] now there's a lot going
[00:03:03 - 00:03:06] on in the economy right
[00:03:06 - 00:03:06] now um there was some
[00:03:06 - 00:03:08] concern rightfully so that inflation
[00:03:08 - 00:03:12] was going to spike and
[00:03:12 - 00:03:12] uh yields moved a little
[00:03:14 - 00:03:14] bit higher on that and
[00:03:14 - 00:03:16] the fed is on hold
[00:03:16 - 00:03:16] because there's so much uncertainty
[00:03:20 - 00:03:20] and there's been a real
[00:03:20 - 00:03:22] turn in terms of expectations
[00:03:22 - 00:03:25] for the economy now investors
[00:03:25 - 00:03:25] in the market are positioning
[00:03:27 - 00:03:27] themselves for recession and that
[00:03:28 - 00:03:32] is related entirely to the
[00:03:32 - 00:03:32] the tariff threat to be
[00:03:32 - 00:03:34] honest with you uh nothing
[00:03:34 - 00:03:36] nothing else there's a lot
[00:03:36 - 00:03:38] of uncertainty with businesses right
[00:03:38 - 00:03:38] now if you were a
[00:03:40 - 00:03:40] business you would be disincined
[00:03:40 - 00:03:42] to spend and invest and
[00:03:42 - 00:03:45] buy new equipment as a
[00:03:45 - 00:03:45] consumer you're worried about your
[00:03:48 - 00:03:48] job you are concerned uh
[00:03:48 - 00:03:51] basically about the economy going
[00:03:51 - 00:03:53] forward so you're not spending
[00:03:53 - 00:03:55] there's there's a lot going
[00:03:55 - 00:03:55] on we also have the
[00:03:58 - 00:03:58] businesses have imported a tremendous
[00:04:00 - 00:04:00] amount in front of tariffs
[00:04:00 - 00:04:02] and and exports have also
[00:04:02 - 00:04:04] fallen and all of those
[00:04:04 - 00:04:04] together and of course government
[00:04:05 - 00:04:05] spending has also been reduced
[00:04:05 - 00:04:07] in the first quarter all
[00:04:07 - 00:04:09] those together mean that economic
[00:04:09 - 00:04:11] growth right now is trending
[00:04:11 - 00:04:11] according to the atlanta fed
[00:04:15 - 00:04:15] gdp now measure at negative
[00:04:15 - 00:04:16] 1 8 i don't think
[00:04:16 - 00:04:16] it's going to be negative
[00:04:18 - 00:04:18] for the first quarter when
[00:04:18 - 00:04:20] all said and done when
[00:04:20 - 00:04:20] all the numbers are in
[00:04:20 - 00:04:22] but definitely has been a
[00:04:22 - 00:04:26] slowdown in the economy so
[00:04:26 - 00:04:26] um interest rates are not
[00:04:29 - 00:04:29] too far off from where
[00:04:29 - 00:04:31] they were u the fed
[00:04:31 - 00:04:31] again is on hold the
[00:04:31 - 00:04:36] expectation is at some point
[00:04:36 - 00:04:36] they will more likely cut
[00:04:36 - 00:04:38] rates in the second half
[00:04:38 - 00:04:40] of the year than raise
[00:04:40 - 00:04:40] rates but the fed doesn't
[00:04:40 - 00:04:42] know what it's going to
[00:04:42 - 00:04:42] do so it's going to
[00:04:43 - 00:04:43] have to take a cue
[00:04:43 - 00:04:46] from the administration as will
[00:04:46 - 00:04:49] the rest of the world
[00:04:49 - 00:04:49] um as far as the
[00:04:49 - 00:04:56] endowment is me uh this
[00:04:56 - 00:04:56] is um this is this
[00:04:56 - 00:04:57] is actually helpful there's a
[00:04:57 - 00:04:59] there's a bloomberg survey that
[00:04:59 - 00:05:02] comes out once a month
[00:05:02 - 00:05:02] where they survey 80 odd
[00:05:04 - 00:05:04] economists well 80 economists not
[00:05:04 - 00:05:07] odd economists um and i
[00:05:07 - 00:05:09] think it's really interesting if
[00:05:09 - 00:05:12] you look at gdp expectations
[00:05:12 - 00:05:12] for the next six quarters
[00:05:14 - 00:05:14] the economists don't know either
[00:05:14 - 00:05:16] so they're all gluming around
[00:05:16 - 00:05:19] this central tendency of 2
[00:05:19 - 00:05:19] growth um and and that
[00:05:21 - 00:05:21] goes out for almost two
[00:05:21 - 00:05:23] years the unemployment rate they
[00:05:23 - 00:05:25] expect it's currently at 4
[00:05:25 - 00:05:27] 1 they expect it'll move
[00:05:27 - 00:05:27] up to 4 2 that
[00:05:27 - 00:05:27] really is kind of a
[00:05:29 - 00:05:29] bailout in my opinion they're
[00:05:29 - 00:05:32] basically not wanting to make
[00:05:32 - 00:05:34] a prediction um they believe
[00:05:34 - 00:05:34] the fed will cut rates
[00:05:35 - 00:05:35] starting in the summer and
[00:05:35 - 00:05:37] cut by a quarter point
[00:05:37 - 00:05:37] in the third quarter and
[00:05:37 - 00:05:40] a quarter point in the
[00:05:40 - 00:05:42] fourth quarter um and then
[00:05:42 - 00:05:42] it'll basically stay near three
[00:05:45 - 00:05:45] and a half i think
[00:05:45 - 00:05:49] all of that could change
[00:05:49 - 00:05:49] within a day or a
[00:05:49 - 00:05:50] week um so i wouldn't
[00:05:50 - 00:05:50] put a whole lot of
[00:05:50 - 00:05:52] stock in that i do
[00:05:53 - 00:05:57] think that holy smokes get
[00:05:57 - 00:05:59] into the investment strategy what
[00:05:59 - 00:05:59] we want to do even
[00:05:59 - 00:06:01] though rates have been generally
[00:06:01 - 00:06:03] staying put uh and we
[00:06:03 - 00:06:03] have had some issues with
[00:06:03 - 00:06:05] the safekeeping agent getting everything
[00:06:05 - 00:06:07] set up i believe that
[00:06:07 - 00:06:08] things are set up at
[00:06:09 - 00:06:09] this point so this is
[00:06:09 - 00:06:10] going to look somewhat similar
[00:06:10 - 00:06:10] to what i presented the
[00:06:14 - 00:06:14] last time what i would
[00:06:14 - 00:06:14] like to do is is
[00:06:17 - 00:06:17] invest these monies out along
[00:06:17 - 00:06:20] the curve so that we
[00:06:20 - 00:06:20] can lock in the cash
[00:06:20 - 00:06:22] flow to to be able
[00:06:22 - 00:06:24] to fund your scholarships going
[00:06:24 - 00:06:24] forward and to the extent
[00:06:24 - 00:06:26] that is possible i i
[00:06:26 - 00:06:26] would like to see most
[00:06:26 - 00:06:30] of that placed out longer
[00:06:30 - 00:06:34] on the curve so retaining
[00:06:34 - 00:06:34] 1 5 million in investment
[00:06:36 - 00:06:36] pools or liquid products i
[00:06:36 - 00:06:41] i understand that that that
[00:06:41 - 00:06:41] liquid pool rate will generally
[00:06:43 - 00:06:43] fall but i like the
[00:06:43 - 00:06:45] idea of having some of
[00:06:45 - 00:06:45] this liquid because we're not
[00:06:45 - 00:06:46] going to know where things
[00:06:46 - 00:06:48] are going to go and
[00:06:48 - 00:06:48] obviously you're going to have
[00:06:48 - 00:06:51] some uh scholarships to fund
[00:06:51 - 00:06:54] initially 12 million out in
[00:06:54 - 00:06:54] in 2 million blocks uh
[00:06:56 - 00:06:56] going out six to seven
[00:06:56 - 00:06:58] years the estimated yield there
[00:06:58 - 00:07:01] is about four and a
[00:07:01 - 00:07:01] quarter uh 12 million out
[00:07:01 - 00:07:02] in the 5 to sixyear
[00:07:02 - 00:07:02] range estimated yield of about
[00:07:05 - 00:07:05] 415 3 million out in
[00:07:05 - 00:07:07] the four to five year
[00:07:07 - 00:07:07] range with an estimated yield
[00:07:07 - 00:07:10] of four and 3 million
[00:07:10 - 00:07:10] out in the 3 to
[00:07:10 - 00:07:12] four year range with an
[00:07:12 - 00:07:16] estimated yield of just about
[00:07:16 - 00:07:16] 4 this moves around a
[00:07:16 - 00:07:17] lot it's actually a little
[00:07:17 - 00:07:19] bit higher today than it
[00:07:19 - 00:07:19] was when i put this
[00:07:19 - 00:07:21] together obviously the higher yields
[00:07:21 - 00:07:23] the more you're going to
[00:07:23 - 00:07:23] have uh in terms of
[00:07:25 - 00:07:25] income spun off of that
[00:07:25 - 00:07:28] that will allow you to
[00:07:28 - 00:07:28] fund scholarships this is a
[00:07:30 - 00:07:30] conservative approach you're not going
[00:07:32 - 00:07:32] to be in full faith
[00:07:32 - 00:07:35] in credit treasuries instead of
[00:07:35 - 00:07:35] you know other things we
[00:07:37 - 00:07:37] feel like this is the
[00:07:37 - 00:07:39] best approach we don't believe
[00:07:39 - 00:07:39] that this this puts the
[00:07:42 - 00:07:42] principle at risk in any
[00:07:42 - 00:07:46] way um and all of
[00:07:46 - 00:07:49] these treasuries will have coupons
[00:07:49 - 00:07:49] that pay every six months
[00:07:49 - 00:07:50] so despite the fact that
[00:07:50 - 00:07:54] the securities will be placed
[00:07:54 - 00:07:54] out in a ladder going
[00:07:54 - 00:07:58] out from roughly 3 to
[00:07:58 - 00:08:00] seven years you'll get coupon
[00:08:00 - 00:08:02] payments regularly that will allow
[00:08:02 - 00:08:02] you to be able to
[00:08:02 - 00:08:04] fund the scholarships that you're
[00:08:04 - 00:08:09] intending to fund so um
[00:08:09 - 00:08:09] i think that pretty much
[00:08:09 - 00:08:11] wraps it up i i
[00:08:11 - 00:08:11] i recognize that you guys
[00:08:11 - 00:08:13] might have some questions this
[00:08:13 - 00:08:16] is generally a pretty simple
[00:08:16 - 00:08:19] straightforward conservative as it should
[00:08:19 - 00:08:19] be for your conservative as
[00:08:19 - 00:08:20] it should be for your
[00:08:20 - 00:08:23] your your your endowment endowment
[00:08:25 - 00:08:28] strategy yes sir okay let's
[00:08:28 - 00:08:28] take the first the third
[00:08:30 - 00:08:30] point purchase 12 million us
[00:08:30 - 00:08:32] traders securities in blocks of
[00:08:32 - 00:08:35] pro now you don't mean
[00:08:35 - 00:08:35] that you're going to make
[00:08:35 - 00:08:38] one bond purchase for 2
[00:08:38 - 00:08:40] million is this you're you're
[00:08:40 - 00:08:40] going to make an aggregate
[00:08:44 - 00:08:44] of of uh bonds that
[00:08:44 - 00:08:44] will work up to 2
[00:08:45 - 00:08:45] million are you going to
[00:08:45 - 00:08:48] is does this say i'm
[00:08:48 - 00:08:48] going to make one 2
[00:08:48 - 00:08:51] million purchase they would be
[00:08:51 - 00:08:53] 2 million blocks so you
[00:08:53 - 00:08:53] would have that would be
[00:08:55 - 00:08:55] one purchase so in the
[00:08:55 - 00:08:57] case of this six to
[00:08:57 - 00:08:57] seven years we'd make six
[00:08:57 - 00:09:01] purchases in that sector um
[00:09:01 - 00:09:03] probably you know roughly every
[00:09:03 - 00:09:03] two months so that would
[00:09:05 - 00:09:05] be spread out but yes
[00:09:05 - 00:09:07] that's that's the intent so
[00:09:07 - 00:09:07] they would be they would
[00:09:10 - 00:09:10] be a 2 million i
[00:09:10 - 00:09:12] mean a single single bond
[00:09:12 - 00:09:12] of of 2 million so
[00:09:12 - 00:09:14] that when you say a
[00:09:14 - 00:09:14] block that's essentially the size
[00:09:23 - 00:09:23] do we have any other
[00:09:23 - 00:09:25] questions no we're good thank
[00:09:25 - 00:09:27] you okay thank you sir

[00:23:57 - 00:23:57] um earlier this semester an
[00:23:59 - 00:23:59] issue came up i'm not
[00:23:59 - 00:24:01] going to go into the
[00:24:01 - 00:24:01] details of it but it's
[00:24:01 - 00:24:03] a rather controversial issue among
[00:24:03 - 00:24:04] the faculty a lot of
[00:24:04 - 00:24:07] faculty felt very passionate about
[00:24:07 - 00:24:07] it i myself included i
[00:24:07 - 00:24:10] felt it was something we
[00:24:10 - 00:24:11] didn't need but something that
[00:24:11 - 00:24:11] was going to happen and
[00:24:13 - 00:24:13] when it came up i
[00:24:13 - 00:24:15] encouraged faculty to send their
[00:24:15 - 00:24:17] comments in to institutional effectiveness
[00:24:17 - 00:24:19] during the 21-day review period
[00:24:19 - 00:24:19] and a lot of faculty
[00:24:19 - 00:24:21] did and they were very
[00:24:21 - 00:24:21] very very very excuse me
[00:24:23 - 00:24:23] they were very passionate about
[00:24:23 - 00:24:24] it and they had some
[00:24:24 - 00:24:27] good suggestions and uh eventually
[00:24:27 - 00:24:28] just suggestions and uh eventually
[00:24:29 - 00:24:31] just recently recently uh administration

[00:24:36 - 00:24:38] the classified and professional staff

[00:27:14 - 00:27:17] support our enrollment and student
[00:27:17 - 00:27:19] success goals i'm going to
[00:27:19 - 00:27:21] note because i'm coming from
[00:27:21 - 00:27:23] student enrollment services that this
[00:27:23 - 00:27:26] work is a collegewide work
[00:27:26 - 00:27:29] right enrollment we we refer
[00:27:29 - 00:27:29] to your messaging a lot
[00:27:29 - 00:27:30] dr graham that we're all
[00:27:30 - 00:27:33] recruiters we're all responsible for
[00:27:33 - 00:27:36] uh enrollment at the college
[00:27:36 - 00:27:36] so it's the daily work
[00:27:36 - 00:27:40] of the faculty staff leadership
[00:27:40 - 00:27:43] my cabinet colleagues their respective
[00:27:43 - 00:27:45] division leadership dr sarata's leadership
[00:27:45 - 00:27:46] and support and guidance provided
[00:27:46 - 00:27:49] by the board of trustees
[00:27:49 - 00:27:51] that contribute to the results
[00:27:51 - 00:27:55] we see today so dr
[00:27:55 - 00:27:59] saratas just spoiled my surprise
[00:27:59 - 00:27:59] but i'm just kidding uh
[00:27:59 - 00:28:01] so i i figured i
[00:28:01 - 00:28:01] was going to start with
[00:28:02 - 00:28:02] this right we're going to
[00:28:02 - 00:28:04] kick off by sharing this
[00:28:04 - 00:28:08] great news this spring enrollment
[00:28:08 - 00:28:08] is showing a 5 increase
[00:28:08 - 00:28:11] over 2024 we're up over
[00:28:11 - 00:28:13] 24 000 student students as
[00:28:13 - 00:28:13] of last week which is
[00:28:15 - 00:28:15] really great and i put
[00:28:15 - 00:28:18] that little applause emoji not
[00:28:18 - 00:28:21] expecting the audience to applaud
[00:28:21 - 00:28:24] or anything but uh or
[00:28:24 - 00:28:28] to think about that right
[00:28:28 - 00:28:28] i i thank you you're
[00:28:28 - 00:28:30] you're applauding for yourselves and
[00:28:30 - 00:28:32] all the good work that
[00:28:32 - 00:28:32] you're doing so uh if
[00:28:34 - 00:28:34] you look at the the
[00:28:34 - 00:28:36] enrollment figure up there what
[00:28:36 - 00:28:36] you can see is this
[00:28:36 - 00:28:39] is showing the different student
[00:28:39 - 00:28:42] types our continuing students represent
[00:28:42 - 00:28:44] 54 of our enrollment and
[00:28:44 - 00:28:48] then early college high school
[00:28:48 - 00:28:48] pek and dual credit enrollment
[00:28:51 - 00:28:51] represent another 39 so the
[00:28:51 - 00:28:53] majority of our enrollment goes
[00:28:53 - 00:28:57] to continuing students and uh
[00:28:57 - 00:28:58] early college pek and dual
[00:28:59 - 00:29:01] credit enrollment if we continue
[00:29:01 - 00:29:04] looking at student type you
[00:29:04 - 00:29:04] could see we we have
[00:29:07 - 00:29:07] significant gains in continuing educa
[00:29:09 - 00:29:09] continuing students which is a
[00:29:09 - 00:29:12] marker that we always look
[00:29:12 - 00:29:13] at so those are students
[00:29:13 - 00:29:13] that are already enrolled at
[00:29:16 - 00:29:16] the college and what they're
[00:29:16 - 00:29:19] doing is they're showing us
[00:29:19 - 00:29:22] that the good work that
[00:29:22 - 00:29:22] our faculty and staff are
[00:29:22 - 00:29:25] doing merits them returning so
[00:29:25 - 00:29:27] up you know almost 400
[00:29:27 - 00:29:30] students over the previous semester
[00:29:30 - 00:29:30] we also see strong enrollment
[00:29:32 - 00:29:32] in dual credit early college
[00:29:32 - 00:29:35] high school petac etc so
[00:29:35 - 00:29:37] we're doing uh really well
[00:29:37 - 00:29:39] in in these individual areas
[00:29:39 - 00:29:39] and we continue to see
[00:29:39 - 00:29:41] that we're providing great opportunities
[00:29:41 - 00:29:44] for the students out at
[00:29:44 - 00:29:45] the isds if we just
[00:29:45 - 00:29:47] look at what spring enrollment
[00:29:47 - 00:29:47] has looked like over the
[00:29:47 - 00:29:50] past four four semesters we
[00:29:50 - 00:29:53] can look at this trend
[00:29:53 - 00:29:53] and see that from spring
[00:29:53 - 00:29:55] 2022 up till now we
[00:29:55 - 00:29:55] keep seeing that increased till
[00:29:56 - 00:29:57] now we keep seeing that
[00:29:57 - 00:30:02] increased enrollment enrollment 22 46
[00:30:02 - 00:30:02] in 22 up to 24
[00:30:02 - 00:30:02] 06 students as of 22
[00:30:02 - 00:30:03] 46 in 22 up to
[00:30:03 - 00:30:03] 24 06 students as of
[00:30:03 - 00:30:06] spring spring 2025 we had
[00:30:06 - 00:30:06] just started our new uh
[00:30:06 - 00:30:08] or we're just starting our
[00:30:08 - 00:30:10] new semester so the number
[00:30:10 - 00:30:12] has increased a little bit
[00:30:12 - 00:30:15] since then breaking this down
[00:30:15 - 00:30:17] by campus enrollment likewise we're
[00:30:17 - 00:30:19] looking at this this spring
[00:30:19 - 00:30:19] and you could see for
[00:30:19 - 00:30:22] the most part our campuses
[00:30:22 - 00:30:24] are showing great improvement look
[00:30:24 - 00:30:28] at trans mountain at 12
[00:30:28 - 00:30:28] up mission el paso at
[00:30:28 - 00:30:30] 7 up and then dual
[00:30:30 - 00:30:30] credit early college pek at
[00:30:34 - 00:30:34] 14 up so we're seeing
[00:30:34 - 00:30:37] significant and online also growing
[00:30:37 - 00:30:38] so up 1 we're seeing
[00:30:38 - 00:30:39] significant improvement across seeing significant
[00:30:39 - 00:30:43] improvement across our our campuses
[00:30:43 - 00:30:43] in looking at how our
[00:30:43 - 00:30:46] students are enrolling full-time enrollment
[00:30:46 - 00:30:48] grew by over 4 in
[00:30:48 - 00:30:51] 2024 those are the shorter
[00:30:51 - 00:30:51] the bars the teal bars
[00:30:51 - 00:30:53] that's a great indicator because
[00:30:53 - 00:30:55] we want our students to
[00:30:55 - 00:30:55] try to attend full-time we
[00:30:57 - 00:30:57] know that that full-time enrollment
[00:30:59 - 00:30:59] contributes to student success we
[00:31:00 - 00:31:01] also know that the majority
[00:31:01 - 00:31:03] of our students attend are
[00:31:03 - 00:31:03] part-time and we still see
[00:31:12 - 00:31:12] 2024 our uh major type
[00:31:12 - 00:31:14] we're seeing this is really
[00:31:14 - 00:31:16] concurrent this is this is
[00:31:16 - 00:31:16] a great example we have
[00:31:16 - 00:31:18] 5 increase in both academic
[00:31:18 - 00:31:22] and technical enrollment which matches
[00:31:22 - 00:31:26] our 5 growth and then
[00:31:26 - 00:31:28] by degree type we're seeing
[00:31:28 - 00:31:28] gains in associate of applied
[00:31:31 - 00:31:31] science which is on the
[00:31:31 - 00:31:34] far left associate of arts
[00:31:34 - 00:31:34] up by 9 because we
[00:31:36 - 00:31:36] continue to see that growth
[00:31:36 - 00:31:38] in the early college area
[00:31:38 - 00:31:38] and those are the awards
[00:31:39 - 00:31:39] those stu or those are
[00:31:39 - 00:31:43] the majors those students are
[00:31:43 - 00:31:43] are uh signing up for
[00:31:45 - 00:31:45] associate of arts and teaching
[00:31:46 - 00:31:46] associate of science you can
[00:31:46 - 00:31:48] see continues to decrease it's
[00:31:48 - 00:31:50] been a steady decrease 10
[00:31:50 - 00:31:53] over the last year over
[00:31:53 - 00:31:53] the last four years certificate
[00:31:53 - 00:31:55] of completions continue to increase
[00:31:56 - 00:31:58] and that undeclared is up
[00:31:58 - 00:32:01] by a few students so
[00:32:01 - 00:32:01] it's very few students so
[00:32:01 - 00:32:04] a small number makes that
[00:32:04 - 00:32:06] percentage grow so we try
[00:32:06 - 00:32:06] to get the students to
[00:32:06 - 00:32:07] declare to say what they're
[00:32:07 - 00:32:07] going to want to study
[00:32:09 - 00:32:09] but i always think those
[00:32:09 - 00:32:11] students have a lot of
[00:32:11 - 00:32:12] opportunities they're not quite sure
[00:32:12 - 00:32:12] what they're going to do
[00:32:12 - 00:32:14] and we'll get them on
[00:32:14 - 00:32:17] a pathway shortly in instructional
[00:32:17 - 00:32:19] mode i think this is
[00:32:19 - 00:32:19] a really great one and
[00:32:19 - 00:32:21] that the deans can attest
[00:32:21 - 00:32:23] to and anybody who's been
[00:32:23 - 00:32:23] on the campuses is that
[00:32:23 - 00:32:26] you see the parking lots
[00:32:26 - 00:32:26] a lot fuller you see
[00:32:28 - 00:32:28] people walking around you see
[00:32:28 - 00:32:29] a lot more life and
[00:32:29 - 00:32:32] the students are voting that
[00:32:32 - 00:32:32] way in those face-to-face classes
[00:32:36 - 00:32:36] so we see up 6
[00:32:36 - 00:32:38] face toface and 6 hybrid
[00:32:38 - 00:32:38] and that's a testament to
[00:32:38 - 00:32:40] the work that's going on
[00:32:40 - 00:32:42] at the mission daso campus
[00:32:42 - 00:32:42] with the 8week sections the
[00:32:44 - 00:32:44] increase in hybrid classes and
[00:32:44 - 00:32:46] then online you could see
[00:32:46 - 00:32:48] not as high as where
[00:32:48 - 00:32:48] we were in 22 but
[00:32:48 - 00:32:51] a slight increase over the
[00:32:51 - 00:32:54] previous year and then in
[00:32:54 - 00:32:54] age groups this is a
[00:32:55 - 00:32:55] really interesting one too that
[00:32:55 - 00:32:58] we get to see that
[00:32:58 - 00:32:58] this is also a very
[00:32:58 - 00:33:00] recent phenomenon where we see
[00:33:00 - 00:33:02] all the age groups you
[00:33:02 - 00:33:02] can see our bread and
[00:33:02 - 00:33:05] butter is on the far
[00:33:05 - 00:33:05] left side of the of
[00:33:05 - 00:33:07] the figure but we did
[00:33:07 - 00:33:07] see a gain in uh
[00:33:10 - 00:33:10] enrollment in all the age
[00:33:10 - 00:33:14] groups to all the for
[00:33:14 - 00:33:14] all the students that we
[00:33:14 - 00:33:17] serve and then wrapping up
[00:33:17 - 00:33:20] this enrollment report is what's
[00:33:20 - 00:33:23] the most challenging item for
[00:33:23 - 00:33:23] students it's how to pay
[00:33:23 - 00:33:25] for school and one of
[00:33:25 - 00:33:26] the things that you're going
[00:33:26 - 00:33:26] to notice is well let's
[00:33:28 - 00:33:28] think back last year last
[00:33:28 - 00:33:31] year there was the big
[00:33:31 - 00:33:34] fafsa issue delays challenges with
[00:33:34 - 00:33:34] when it was going to
[00:33:35 - 00:33:35] come out and not understanding
[00:33:35 - 00:33:37] the new processes it was
[00:33:37 - 00:33:40] the new form this past
[00:33:40 - 00:33:40] year a little bit of
[00:33:40 - 00:33:41] a delay but i'm going
[00:33:41 - 00:33:41] to give a lot of
[00:33:41 - 00:33:43] credit here we've have a
[00:33:43 - 00:33:45] great leader in our financial
[00:33:45 - 00:33:45] aid and veteran affairs area
[00:33:47 - 00:33:47] missy nes lopez who steered
[00:33:47 - 00:33:49] the ship made sure that
[00:33:49 - 00:33:52] we served our students properly
[00:33:52 - 00:33:52] and they never had those
[00:33:52 - 00:33:55] big hiccups and you can
[00:33:55 - 00:33:58] see that in that table
[00:33:58 - 00:33:58] there's two uh rows that
[00:33:58 - 00:34:00] pell grants offered you can
[00:34:00 - 00:34:03] see continues to grow all
[00:34:03 - 00:34:06] students graduating from high school
[00:34:06 - 00:34:06] are required to complete a
[00:34:06 - 00:34:09] fafsa as a as a
[00:34:09 - 00:34:11] graduation requirement and then they
[00:34:11 - 00:34:11] submit a tpcc and utp
[00:34:11 - 00:34:13] as well so we get
[00:34:13 - 00:34:13] a lot of students submitting
[00:34:15 - 00:34:15] them to us the important
[00:34:15 - 00:34:18] line is the second one
[00:34:18 - 00:34:18] the pel grants paid and
[00:34:18 - 00:34:21] you can see it increasing
[00:34:21 - 00:34:24] every year a significant jump
[00:34:24 - 00:34:27] this past year almost 23
[00:34:27 - 00:34:27] million paid out which represents
[00:34:27 - 00:34:30] a 3 million over 3
[00:34:30 - 00:34:32] million increase from the previous
[00:34:32 - 00:34:35] year 16 difference from the
[00:34:35 - 00:34:37] previous year which far exceeds
[00:34:37 - 00:34:41] the 5 enrollment increase so
[00:34:41 - 00:34:43] our students need this aid
[00:34:43 - 00:34:43] we can see 88 of
[00:34:43 - 00:34:46] our students receive financial aid
[00:34:46 - 00:34:48] and this is demonstrating that
[00:34:48 - 00:34:50] we're helping them get that
[00:34:50 - 00:34:54] aid as they need it
[00:34:54 - 00:34:54] so that wraps up just
[00:34:54 - 00:34:57] the basic enrollment you can
[00:34:57 - 00:34:59] look at the numbers but
[00:34:59 - 00:34:59] then you would ask me
[00:34:59 - 00:35:00] i'll anticipate this right you
[00:35:00 - 00:35:02] would say so what do
[00:35:02 - 00:35:02] we do to support this
[00:35:03 - 00:35:03] enrollment and i told you
[00:35:03 - 00:35:06] you know it's it's a
[00:35:06 - 00:35:09] collegewide effort but i'll speak
[00:35:09 - 00:35:09] to a few things and
[00:35:09 - 00:35:10] this is division of student
[00:35:10 - 00:35:13] and enrollment services my division
[00:35:13 - 00:35:14] it's big but i'm not
[00:35:14 - 00:35:14] going to go through that
[00:35:14 - 00:35:16] whole list i'll just highlight
[00:35:16 - 00:35:16] a few of the areas
[00:35:19 - 00:35:19] that i think uh really
[00:35:19 - 00:35:20] stand out or or make
[00:35:20 - 00:35:23] a big impact i'll start
[00:35:23 - 00:35:24] since i ended with financial
[00:35:24 - 00:35:24] aid i'll start with financial
[00:35:28 - 00:35:28] aid so as i mentioned
[00:35:28 - 00:35:30] this area is directed by
[00:35:30 - 00:35:32] miss lopez executive director of
[00:35:32 - 00:35:35] student financial aid and veterans
[00:35:35 - 00:35:35] affairs and so we get
[00:35:35 - 00:35:37] out in the community and
[00:35:37 - 00:35:39] this is just one example
[00:35:39 - 00:35:39] this past spring we typically
[00:35:41 - 00:35:41] do it in the fall
[00:35:41 - 00:35:42] but because of the delay
[00:35:42 - 00:35:42] in the fafsa we did
[00:35:42 - 00:35:45] it in the spring we
[00:35:45 - 00:35:45] work along with our partners
[00:35:47 - 00:35:47] at the university of texas
[00:35:47 - 00:35:51] at el paso and texas
[00:35:51 - 00:35:51] tech and we hold 54
[00:35:51 - 00:35:53] different fafsa night events that
[00:35:53 - 00:35:56] means these are in the
[00:35:56 - 00:35:56] evening our we send teams
[00:35:56 - 00:35:58] out to these schools and
[00:35:58 - 00:36:01] they meet with the community
[00:36:01 - 00:36:01] directly so they are there
[00:36:01 - 00:36:03] to assist the students and
[00:36:03 - 00:36:05] their families importantly navigate the
[00:36:05 - 00:36:08] financial aid process it ran
[00:36:08 - 00:36:08] from the end of january
[00:36:11 - 00:36:11] to the end of february
[00:36:11 - 00:36:13] and then it all wraps
[00:36:13 - 00:36:13] up we just wrapped it
[00:36:13 - 00:36:15] up this past saturday and
[00:36:15 - 00:36:18] this is really excuse me
[00:36:18 - 00:36:18] also a story of partnerships
[00:36:18 - 00:36:21] i mentioned our higher ed
[00:36:21 - 00:36:24] partners also education service center
[00:36:24 - 00:36:27] region 19 we they host
[00:36:27 - 00:36:27] us at the boeing office
[00:36:27 - 00:36:30] this past saturday where we
[00:36:30 - 00:36:32] open up this financial aid
[00:36:32 - 00:36:32] workshop to the entire el
[00:36:36 - 00:36:36] paso community and our specialists
[00:36:36 - 00:36:37] and also from the other
[00:36:37 - 00:36:40] schools come together and assist
[00:36:40 - 00:36:41] these families so it was
[00:36:41 - 00:36:41] a great event and we're
[00:36:41 - 00:36:44] going to continue doing this
[00:36:44 - 00:36:46] and i'll let you know
[00:36:46 - 00:36:46] also is something happened that
[00:36:46 - 00:36:47] day where we have these
[00:36:47 - 00:36:50] financial aid experts from these
[00:36:50 - 00:36:53] three institutions sitting down looking
[00:36:53 - 00:36:55] at the data trying to
[00:36:55 - 00:36:55] solve these problems and see
[00:36:55 - 00:36:58] how we can better serve
[00:36:58 - 00:37:01] our students continuing with this
[00:37:01 - 00:37:04] uh this is the area
[00:37:04 - 00:37:04] that maybe most of you
[00:37:04 - 00:37:05] all are familiar with and
[00:37:05 - 00:37:08] that's the recruitment services led
[00:37:08 - 00:37:09] by our director of recruitment
[00:37:09 - 00:37:12] services mr michael talamantes who's
[00:37:12 - 00:37:14] done a fantastic job you
[00:37:14 - 00:37:14] can see the list of
[00:37:14 - 00:37:16] items under his area um
[00:37:16 - 00:37:16] i'm not going to even
[00:37:16 - 00:37:18] go through them all but
[00:37:18 - 00:37:20] i'll tell you he's brought
[00:37:20 - 00:37:20] the college together through the
[00:37:23 - 00:37:23] epcc recruitment network he's held
[00:37:23 - 00:37:26] our signature epcc roundup event
[00:37:26 - 00:37:28] which is our parent focused
[00:37:28 - 00:37:32] event hosted this past uh
[00:37:32 - 00:37:32] year this past spring uh
[00:37:32 - 00:37:34] at the sooto independent school
[00:37:34 - 00:37:35] district d district service center
[00:37:35 - 00:37:37] open to everybody so we
[00:37:37 - 00:37:39] give credit another example of
[00:37:39 - 00:37:42] our partnerships it's open to
[00:37:42 - 00:37:44] the entire el paso community
[00:37:44 - 00:37:44] where we bring all our
[00:37:47 - 00:37:49] services plus opportunities for students
[00:37:49 - 00:37:49] he's also run several open
[00:37:52 - 00:37:52] houses so you can talk
[00:37:52 - 00:37:54] to the deans uh uh
[00:37:54 - 00:37:54] health and cte earlier this
[00:37:54 - 00:37:57] year nursing uh the steam
[00:37:57 - 00:37:59] open house at vay verde
[00:37:59 - 00:37:59] the welcome days as students
[00:38:02 - 00:38:02] return every semester so we
[00:38:02 - 00:38:04] are out and about as
[00:38:04 - 00:38:04] well as messaging students so
[00:38:06 - 00:38:06] we have the ability to
[00:38:06 - 00:38:08] text message students through student
[00:38:08 - 00:38:10] bridge and have a call
[00:38:10 - 00:38:10] center for uh making calls
[00:38:10 - 00:38:13] to reach out to them
[00:38:13 - 00:38:15] as well our admissions and
[00:38:15 - 00:38:18] registration department run by executive
[00:38:18 - 00:38:20] director cassandra lachica chavez dr
[00:38:20 - 00:38:23] lachica chavez does an amazing
[00:38:23 - 00:38:25] job because she not only
[00:38:25 - 00:38:25] oversees that area but also
[00:38:25 - 00:38:27] the dual credit early college
[00:38:27 - 00:38:30] and pek enrollment on the
[00:38:30 - 00:38:32] student services side likewise students
[00:38:32 - 00:38:36] have a requirement to submit
[00:38:36 - 00:38:39] an apply texas uh application
[00:38:39 - 00:38:41] upon graduation before graduation so
[00:38:41 - 00:38:41] we you can see i
[00:38:41 - 00:38:43] just gave you some numbers
[00:38:43 - 00:38:46] of the amount of applications
[00:38:46 - 00:38:46] that we process and what
[00:38:46 - 00:38:48] we do we're we're that
[00:38:48 - 00:38:50] front-facing direct connection with the
[00:38:50 - 00:38:52] student and processing their application
[00:38:52 - 00:38:55] and their enrollment so customer
[00:38:55 - 00:38:57] service is number one but
[00:38:57 - 00:38:57] really in this area what
[00:38:59 - 00:38:59] i wanted to do is
[00:38:59 - 00:38:59] focus on some of the
[00:39:01 - 00:39:01] work that we're doing internally
[00:39:01 - 00:39:04] so we've worked with ap
[00:39:04 - 00:39:07] fernandez and his team to
[00:39:07 - 00:39:07] develop this epcc uh dual
[00:39:07 - 00:39:10] credit early college k through
[00:39:10 - 00:39:13] 12 app we have a
[00:39:13 - 00:39:15] relatively small team five specialists
[00:39:15 - 00:39:19] admission specialists dedicated to processing
[00:39:19 - 00:39:20] the 39 of enrollment that
[00:39:20 - 00:39:22] we have from dual credit
[00:39:22 - 00:39:22] early college and pek and
[00:39:22 - 00:39:24] so you can imagine the
[00:39:24 - 00:39:26] school districts have to send
[00:39:26 - 00:39:26] us rosters and it's a
[00:39:26 - 00:39:30] lot of manual processes we're
[00:39:30 - 00:39:30] working to automate processes we're
[00:39:30 - 00:39:31] working to automate that that
[00:39:33 - 00:39:33] have the team from it
[00:39:33 - 00:39:36] assisting with that so we're
[00:39:36 - 00:39:36] in version 2 0 version
[00:39:38 - 00:39:38] 3 0 is coming up
[00:39:38 - 00:39:39] very quickly that's going to
[00:39:39 - 00:39:43] connect everything to banner and
[00:39:43 - 00:39:43] let students register so we're
[00:39:44 - 00:39:46] seeing good things happen and
[00:39:46 - 00:39:46] then finally i'm going to
[00:39:48 - 00:39:48] wrap it up here which
[00:39:48 - 00:39:52] is what's going on right
[00:39:52 - 00:39:52] now our signature uh premier
[00:39:55 - 00:39:55] enrollment uh initiative for firsttime

[00:39:58 - 00:40:00] presented to the board before

[00:40:02 - 00:40:04] shared this when i in
[00:40:04 - 00:40:06] the during the board orientation
[00:40:06 - 00:40:06] but this is when we
[00:40:06 - 00:40:08] get out to all the
[00:40:08 - 00:40:10] school districts so we're going
[00:40:10 - 00:40:10] to have 22 events we

[00:41:35 - 00:41:35] don't have much of a
[00:41:35 - 00:41:37] question but i'd like to
[00:41:37 - 00:41:37] congratulate you all it's an
[00:41:40 - 00:41:40] excellent teamwork i i seeing
[00:41:40 - 00:41:43] it as a team and
[00:41:43 - 00:41:43] i know mr talamantes and
[00:41:43 - 00:41:44] you know i'll call him
[00:41:44 - 00:41:48] with a short notice and
[00:41:48 - 00:41:48] he'll show up with his
[00:41:48 - 00:41:51] with his team you know
[00:41:51 - 00:41:51] to certain events that i
[00:41:51 - 00:41:54] didn't realize nobody had mentioned
[00:41:54 - 00:41:57] but that's that's great to
[00:41:57 - 00:41:57] see the the effort one
[00:42:01 - 00:42:01] question i do have is
[00:42:01 - 00:42:05] um are we sending any
[00:42:05 - 00:42:05] letters like to the juniors
[00:42:05 - 00:42:08] uh or the sophomores to
[00:42:08 - 00:42:11] let them know that because
[00:42:11 - 00:42:11] again we are all recruiters
[00:42:11 - 00:42:12] but i think we need
[00:42:12 - 00:42:16] to start recruiting at prek
[00:42:16 - 00:42:16] kinder so that you know
[00:42:16 - 00:42:19] they can be headed in
[00:42:19 - 00:42:19] our direction um but because
[00:42:21 - 00:42:21] some of the people that
[00:42:21 - 00:42:23] i talked to get all
[00:42:23 - 00:42:23] excited because they get a
[00:42:23 - 00:42:25] letter from some college do
[00:42:25 - 00:42:25] we do any of those
[00:42:28 - 00:42:28] anymore well we have we
[00:42:28 - 00:42:29] don't send direct letters that's
[00:42:29 - 00:42:32] a great idea we do
[00:42:32 - 00:42:32] have communication with the schools
[00:42:33 - 00:42:33] in the high school because
[00:42:33 - 00:42:35] we work directly with their
[00:42:35 - 00:42:38] college and career readiness specialists
[00:42:38 - 00:42:41] or you know those that
[00:42:41 - 00:42:41] whole group uh we do
[00:42:41 - 00:42:42] have a crm coming on
[00:42:42 - 00:42:42] board you all approved that
[00:42:44 - 00:42:44] just recently so that's going
[00:42:44 - 00:42:46] to assist us with our
[00:42:46 - 00:42:49] messaging and direct messaging to
[00:42:49 - 00:42:49] the students so that is
[00:42:52 - 00:42:54] coming soon and we we
[00:42:54 - 00:42:54] you know i didn't share
[00:42:54 - 00:42:56] that right now you mentioned
[00:42:56 - 00:42:58] reaching out to students in
[00:42:58 - 00:43:01] kindergarten uh under our recruitment
[00:43:01 - 00:43:01] area we have our college
[00:43:01 - 00:43:03] uh readiness mentors and they
[00:43:03 - 00:43:06] work directly with the adopted
[00:43:06 - 00:43:08] schools so that group of
[00:43:08 - 00:43:08] adopted schools are really getting
[00:43:08 - 00:43:10] a lot of epcc and
[00:43:10 - 00:43:12] that's where i've seen some
[00:43:12 - 00:43:12] of the parents that that
[00:43:12 - 00:43:15] come in with uh you
[00:43:15 - 00:43:15] know saying that their kid
[00:43:18 - 00:43:18] is going to go to
[00:43:18 - 00:43:20] epcc and there's events there
[00:43:20 - 00:43:20] where they're coming in to
[00:43:22 - 00:43:22] sign up or something but
[00:43:22 - 00:43:24] they have the little ones
[00:43:24 - 00:43:24] with them and it's it's
[00:43:24 - 00:43:27] a great um connection there
[00:43:27 - 00:43:29] for the little ones to
[00:43:29 - 00:43:29] see that the older ones
[00:43:29 - 00:43:33] are signing up for epcc
[00:43:33 - 00:43:35] absolutely i have one question
[00:43:35 - 00:43:43] yes sir can you please
[00:43:43 - 00:43:43] what slide was i looking
[00:43:43 - 00:43:46] at you're looking at next
[00:43:46 - 00:43:47] one there was a you
[00:43:47 - 00:43:47] had some over to the
[00:43:47 - 00:43:49] side there was everything was
[00:43:49 - 00:43:49] a plus except i thought
[00:43:49 - 00:43:51] i saw a minus 12
[00:43:51 - 00:43:54] yeah there's a couple early
[00:43:54 - 00:43:54] admission you can see down
[00:43:54 - 00:43:57] one student and what's the
[00:43:57 - 00:43:59] reason what what's the reason
[00:43:59 - 00:43:59] for that i i don't
[00:44:01 - 00:44:01] know i mean it's it's
[00:44:01 - 00:44:03] one so the numbers on
[00:44:03 - 00:44:03] the side represent we're down
[00:44:05 - 00:44:05] one student so there are
[00:44:05 - 00:44:06] very few students on that
[00:44:06 - 00:44:08] side these are students that
[00:44:08 - 00:44:08] apply that are in high
[00:44:09 - 00:44:09] school and are going to
[00:44:09 - 00:44:13] apply for early admission uh
[00:44:13 - 00:44:13] outside of their their reg
[00:44:15 - 00:44:15] normal school district we have
[00:44:15 - 00:44:18] a few over here first
[00:44:18 - 00:44:22] time transfers that's a few
[00:44:22 - 00:44:22] students to 78 students down
[00:44:22 - 00:44:24] um i i wouldn't be
[00:44:24 - 00:44:24] able to tell you the
[00:44:24 - 00:44:26] the reason why we we
[00:44:26 - 00:44:28] were down in those little
[00:44:28 - 00:44:28] in those couple of areas
[00:44:28 - 00:44:28] and little in those couple
[00:44:28 - 00:44:29] of areas and what's what's
[00:44:32 - 00:44:32] undetermined uh those are students
[00:44:32 - 00:44:35] who we don't know what
[00:44:35 - 00:44:37] it is or don't declare
[00:44:37 - 00:44:37] what where they're going to
[00:44:37 - 00:44:40] be so or what type
[00:44:40 - 00:44:40] of student they are so
[00:44:43 - 00:44:43] we we fix that later
[00:44:43 - 00:44:44] on we're able to identify
[00:44:44 - 00:44:44] these students but in this
[00:44:47 - 00:44:47] initial report they end up
[00:44:47 - 00:44:49] right there you got to
[00:44:49 - 00:44:49] put the first time transfer
[00:44:51 - 00:44:51] with the under and then
[00:44:51 - 00:44:51] it'll show a 12 with
[00:44:51 - 00:44:52] the under and then it'll
[00:44:52 - 00:44:53] show a 12 increase increase
[00:44:53 - 00:44:56] increase right right i was
[00:44:56 - 00:44:56] just wondering why it was
[00:44:56 - 00:44:57] a negative there and you
[00:44:57 - 00:45:00] have early admission minus six
[00:45:00 - 00:45:02] yeah one one student down
[00:45:02 - 00:45:02] yes sir there are very
[00:45:04 - 00:45:04] few that's why it has

[00:53:26 - 00:53:26] yeah i'll ask mr flores

[00:53:27 - 00:53:30] vice president flores sure thank
[00:53:30 - 00:53:33] you dr sarata so uh
[00:53:33 - 00:53:33] weaver tidwell was employed in
[00:53:33 - 00:53:36] july of uh 26 of
[00:53:39 - 00:53:39] 2024 and so their first
[00:53:39 - 00:53:43] assignment was to test our
[00:53:43 - 00:53:45] compliance with sb17 they completed
[00:53:45 - 00:53:48] that audit and presented to
[00:53:48 - 00:53:48] the board at the february
[00:53:48 - 00:53:50] board meeting uh the results
[00:53:50 - 00:53:54] of the sp17 uh audit
[00:53:54 - 00:53:54] uh there was still a
[00:53:56 - 00:53:59] remaining balance in the 75
[00:53:59 - 00:53:59] 000 annual budget amount so
[00:53:59 - 00:54:04] they began uh a study
[00:54:04 - 00:54:06] of risk assessment from which
[00:54:06 - 00:54:06] future audit plans would be
[00:54:08 - 00:54:08] derived so they've conducted some
[00:54:11 - 00:54:11] initial training in january they
[00:54:15 - 00:54:15] provided a webinar to the
[00:54:15 - 00:54:16] uh cabinet members a one-hour
[00:54:16 - 00:54:18] webinar on risk assessment then
[00:54:18 - 00:54:21] in february they conducted a
[00:54:21 - 00:54:25] 4-hour workshop to the cabinet
[00:54:25 - 00:54:28] on developing risk assessment to
[00:54:28 - 00:54:28] complete that uh assignment for
[00:54:28 - 00:54:30] risk assessment evaluation we anticipate
[00:54:33 - 00:54:33] that there will be uh
[00:54:33 - 00:54:37] some more expenses which 13
[00:54:37 - 00:54:37] 000 would cover one of
[00:54:39 - 00:54:39] there so they're completing the
[00:54:39 - 00:54:42] risk assessment and then they
[00:54:42 - 00:54:45] are going to make a
[00:54:45 - 00:54:45] presentation to the board on
[00:54:45 - 00:54:47] the risk assessment review that
[00:54:47 - 00:54:50] they did and the audit
[00:54:50 - 00:54:50] plan which will guide the
[00:54:50 - 00:54:54] next three years of audits
[00:54:56 - 00:54:56] so hopefully there'll be savings
[00:54:56 - 00:55:00] there to recover the 13
[00:55:00 - 00:55:02] 000 additional hopefully as a
[00:55:02 - 00:55:06] result of their audits yes
[00:55:06 - 00:55:06] ma'am i i have a
[00:55:06 - 00:55:08] question i i guess i
[00:55:08 - 00:55:08] don't understand we had an
[00:55:10 - 00:55:10] initial project was approved for
[00:55:10 - 00:55:12] 75 000 and it was
[00:55:12 - 00:55:15] completed for less than 75
[00:55:15 - 00:55:15] 000 so we assumed a
[00:55:15 - 00:55:17] second responsibility that wasn't outlined
[00:55:17 - 00:55:19] and now we want to
[00:55:19 - 00:55:19] pay 13 000 more for
[00:55:21 - 00:55:21] something that wasn't in the
[00:55:21 - 00:55:23] original contract but we decided
[00:55:23 - 00:55:25] just to do it anyway
[00:55:25 - 00:55:25] did i miss something out
[00:55:25 - 00:55:28] of all this so the
[00:55:28 - 00:55:34] original contract runs from uh
[00:55:34 - 00:55:34] july 2024 to july 2025
[00:55:34 - 00:55:37] those bridge what was the
[00:55:37 - 00:55:37] objective of that 75 000
[00:55:38 - 00:55:38] what was that to cover
[00:55:38 - 00:55:41] to provide any audit services
[00:55:41 - 00:55:41] that the college may deem
[00:55:44 - 00:55:44] necessary okay and risk assessment
[00:55:44 - 00:55:46] so you're piggybacking a new
[00:55:46 - 00:55:47] def an additional requirement of
[00:55:47 - 00:55:50] risk assessment onto the original
[00:55:50 - 00:55:54] contract that's correct sir yes
[00:55:57 - 00:55:57] i i do have a
[00:55:57 - 00:55:57] question uh this is all
[00:55:59 - 00:55:59] put out to bid right
[00:55:59 - 00:56:01] these automatically you were awarded
[00:56:01 - 00:56:04] a 5-year contract with one-year
[00:56:04 - 00:56:07] annual renewals based upon satisfactory
[00:56:07 - 00:56:08] performance they did bid for
[00:56:08 - 00:56:10] it yes sir absolutely all
[00:56:10 - 00:56:11] right just checking okay and
[00:56:11 - 00:56:11] there were a lot of
[00:56:14 - 00:56:17] respondents to that did you
[00:56:17 - 00:56:17] have any like areas that
[00:56:17 - 00:56:19] you were surprised when they
[00:56:19 - 00:56:22] did the risk assessment well
[00:56:22 - 00:56:25] the risk assessment is hugely
[00:56:25 - 00:56:27] comprehensive i think the cabinet
[00:56:27 - 00:56:27] members would attest to that
[00:56:31 - 00:56:31] it's a about eight-page uh
[00:56:31 - 00:56:33] document that identifies all the
[00:56:33 - 00:56:36] key areas based upon weaver
[00:56:36 - 00:56:39] tidwell's experience in auditing that
[00:56:39 - 00:56:39] are potential areas for audit
[00:56:39 - 00:56:43] re risk and the cabinet
[00:56:43 - 00:56:46] rated them on probability and
[00:56:46 - 00:56:46] inherent risk and so as
[00:56:49 - 00:56:49] a result of all of
[00:56:49 - 00:56:51] those areas being rated dr
[00:56:51 - 00:56:55] graham over those seven pages
[00:56:55 - 00:56:55] they are working on a
[00:56:55 - 00:56:58] report as a result of
[00:56:58 - 00:56:58] that that will inform the
[00:57:00 - 00:57:00] administration where the highest areas
[00:57:03 - 00:57:03] of risk are uh the
[00:57:03 - 00:57:08] the the classic areas of
[00:57:08 - 00:57:08] course are security on in
[00:57:08 - 00:57:11] it um security surrounding funds
[00:57:11 - 00:57:13] revenues those kind of things
[00:57:13 - 00:57:16] but their their risk assessment
[00:57:16 - 00:57:19] is hugely comprehensive it's it
[00:57:19 - 00:57:19] was it was a 4-hour
[00:57:19 - 00:57:23] workshop each cabinet member uh
[00:57:23 - 00:57:25] provided input onto the weights
[00:57:25 - 00:57:28] associated with each of those
[00:57:28 - 00:57:28] each of those categories and
[00:57:28 - 00:57:31] so this is how weaver
[00:57:31 - 00:57:33] tidwell um is able to
[00:57:33 - 00:57:35] assess the institutional risk as
[00:57:35 - 00:57:38] a whole resulting from that
[00:57:38 - 00:57:41] uh based upon those weights
[00:57:41 - 00:57:41] then future audits will be
[00:57:41 - 00:57:43] those weights then future audits
[00:57:43 - 00:57:46] will be identified identified where
[00:57:46 - 00:57:46] did facilities fall into that
[00:57:46 - 00:57:49] risk management it was one
[00:57:49 - 00:57:52] of the areas uh so
[00:57:52 - 00:57:53] facilities presents its own challenges
[00:57:53 - 00:57:56] because of deferred maintenance that's
[00:57:56 - 00:57:56] one of uh u there
[00:57:57 - 00:57:57] there were about eight or
[00:57:58 - 00:58:01] nine categories under facilities uh
[00:58:01 - 00:58:06] contract and construction management uh
[00:58:06 - 00:58:06] is a it was a
[00:58:06 - 00:58:07] big item facilities maintenance deferred
[00:58:07 - 00:58:11] maintenance uh plans in the
[00:58:11 - 00:58:11] future how you maintain the
[00:58:14 - 00:58:14] grounds it's pretty extensive and
[00:58:14 - 00:58:15] we're going to get a
[00:58:15 - 00:58:15] report on that when they
[00:58:18 - 00:58:18] come back in so uh
[00:58:18 - 00:58:21] that that report uh chair
[00:58:21 - 00:58:21] hagerty is expected to be
[00:58:24 - 00:58:24] delivered to the board at
[00:58:24 - 00:58:27] the end of april okay
[00:58:27 - 00:58:30] provided that the board approves
[00:58:30 - 00:58:31] the increase uh today but
[00:58:31 - 00:58:34] it but it's you know
[00:58:34 - 00:58:34] i'm not a i'm not
[00:58:34 - 00:58:36] a contract specialist but it
[00:58:36 - 00:58:38] seems to me that if
[00:58:38 - 00:58:38] risk estimate is as you
[00:58:38 - 00:58:42] said such a huge uh
[00:58:42 - 00:58:42] element it it seems to
[00:58:43 - 00:58:43] me that it should have
[00:58:43 - 00:58:46] been identified there and if
[00:58:46 - 00:58:46] it if it's such a
[00:58:46 - 00:58:48] huge element and it hasn't
[00:58:48 - 00:58:51] been identified then i wonder
[00:58:51 - 00:58:54] how they're cap how capable
[00:58:54 - 00:58:54] they are of then not
[00:58:54 - 00:58:56] being able to forecast the
[00:58:56 - 00:58:57] need for something like an
[00:58:57 - 00:59:01] additional 13 000 only six
[00:59:01 - 00:59:01] months ago it all of
[00:59:01 - 00:59:02] a sudden something huge all
[00:59:02 - 00:59:05] of a sudden comes up
[00:59:05 - 00:59:05] we need 13 000 that
[00:59:05 - 00:59:07] we didn't anticipate but we're
[00:59:07 - 00:59:09] going to evaluate you on
[00:59:09 - 00:59:09] risk adjustment because we know
[00:59:12 - 00:59:12] what risks are but they
[00:59:12 - 00:59:14] couldn't risk their own program
[00:59:14 - 00:59:16] i don't i don't understand
[00:59:16 - 00:59:16] all of it so a
[00:59:16 - 00:59:19] a lot of that was
[00:59:19 - 00:59:19] dependent on how much the
[00:59:19 - 00:59:22] sb17 audit would come out
[00:59:22 - 00:59:23] to had okay so we're
[00:59:23 - 00:59:23] saying that maybe they didn't
[00:59:25 - 00:59:25] understand the sbc audit in
[00:59:25 - 00:59:27] the first place and so
[00:59:27 - 00:59:30] they weren't able to properly
[00:59:30 - 00:59:33] risk that ultimately the sb17
[00:59:33 - 00:59:36] cost of that audit was
[00:59:36 - 00:59:36] uh dependent on the extent
[00:59:36 - 00:59:39] of their review of our
[00:59:39 - 00:59:41] uh college and unique policies
[00:59:41 - 00:59:41] and procedures so isn't that
[00:59:43 - 00:59:43] a risk that's defined as
[00:59:43 - 00:59:45] a risk and they missed
[00:59:45 - 00:59:45] it so how good are
[00:59:45 - 00:59:46] they at risk adjustment if
[00:59:46 - 00:59:47] they can't even figure out
[00:59:47 - 00:59:48] how much they're going to
[00:59:49 - 00:59:49] need to do what it
[00:59:49 - 00:59:51] is they said they were
[00:59:51 - 00:59:51] going to do i mean
[00:59:51 - 00:59:58] how much how i don't
[00:59:58 - 00:59:58] know i don't have any
[00:59:58 - 00:59:59] more questions if they don't
[00:59:59 - 01:00:01] know what they're doing i
[01:00:01 - 01:00:01] don't know if i want
[01:00:01 - 01:00:03] to vote for 13 000
[01:00:03 - 01:00:03] for them to pay more
[01:00:03 - 01:00:04] to do something they couldn't
[01:00:04 - 01:00:08] do in the first place
[01:00:08 - 01:00:09] nor could they identify yeah
[01:00:09 - 01:00:09] the only thing i would
[01:00:10 - 01:00:13] respond mr structure is that
[01:00:13 - 01:00:13] sb17 was um a new
[01:00:15 - 01:00:15] law that passed in in
[01:00:15 - 01:00:19] the 88th legislative session um
[01:00:19 - 01:00:22] all institutions um are conducting
[01:00:22 - 01:00:22] um compliance audits um are
[01:00:22 - 01:00:23] conducting um compliance audits with
[01:00:23 - 01:00:27] with sb17 uh i think
[01:00:27 - 01:00:29] it's dependent on uh it's
[01:00:29 - 01:00:29] something new that auditors were
[01:00:32 - 01:00:32] not familiar with um and
[01:00:32 - 01:00:35] the level and depth of
[01:00:35 - 01:00:35] of what is required with
[01:00:38 - 01:00:38] regards to sb17 um was
[01:00:38 - 01:00:41] surprising to even even some
[01:00:41 - 01:00:41] of us in the field
[01:00:41 - 01:00:44] as a new law and
[01:00:44 - 01:00:44] and that would be the
[01:00:44 - 01:00:47] the explanation that i'd provide
[01:00:47 - 01:00:50] for them um on the
[01:00:50 - 01:00:50] extent and how extensive uh
[01:00:50 - 01:00:52] they got into reviewing sb17
[01:00:52 - 01:00:56] if you'll recall um they
[01:00:56 - 01:00:59] provided some examples of where
[01:00:59 - 01:00:59] initially um there was evidence
[01:01:02 - 01:01:02] of non-compliance with sb17 that
[01:01:02 - 01:01:06] we then had to um
[01:01:06 - 01:01:06] remove or change language to
[01:01:08 - 01:01:08] some of our websites um
[01:01:08 - 01:01:12] some of our postings around
[01:01:12 - 01:01:12] campus um in some of
[01:01:12 - 01:01:14] the areas then they'd have
[01:01:14 - 01:01:17] to determine whether it was
[01:01:17 - 01:01:20] in conflict with federal law
[01:01:20 - 01:01:20] versus state law so i
[01:01:20 - 01:01:23] i do give them a
[01:01:23 - 01:01:23] tiny bit of leeway with
[01:01:23 - 01:01:27] regards to sb17 sir well
[01:01:27 - 01:01:27] and it's a good thing
[01:01:27 - 01:01:29] that it took place because
[01:01:29 - 01:01:29] you'll have a better idea
[01:01:31 - 01:01:31] the next time that there's
[01:01:31 - 01:01:35] the same type of audit
[01:01:35 - 01:01:37] but move to approve i
[01:01:37 - 01:01:37] think we already did that
[01:01:37 - 01:01:39] didn't we already do we
[01:01:39 - 01:01:40] did you had a second

[01:02:04 - 01:02:04] action to affirm a three-year
[01:02:04 - 01:02:07] contract with education to go

[01:02:13 - 01:02:16] exceed 80 000 per year

[01:02:18 - 01:02:21] of courses did we have
[01:02:21 - 01:02:28] these services dr graham we've
[01:02:28 - 01:02:30] had the uh contract with
[01:02:30 - 01:02:30] ediggo for quite a while
[01:02:30 - 01:02:33] uh i believe we started
[01:02:33 - 01:02:35] that in um 2018 don't
[01:02:35 - 01:02:35] quote me on that but
[01:02:37 - 01:02:37] we've had it for a
[01:02:37 - 01:02:39] very long time and it
[01:02:39 - 01:02:39] gives us the opportunity to
[01:02:39 - 01:02:41] they added more courses to
[01:02:41 - 01:02:44] it absolutely that's what i
[01:02:44 - 01:02:46] meant that now there's comprehensive
[01:02:46 - 01:02:46] like a lot more than
[01:02:46 - 01:02:48] comprehensive like a lot more
[01:02:48 - 01:02:50] than before before and it
[01:02:50 - 01:02:50] allows us to offer any
[01:02:50 - 01:02:53] number of courses that we
[01:02:53 - 01:02:54] do not have the capacity
[01:02:57 - 01:03:06] internally to offer mrs rob

[01:06:23 - 01:06:27] continuing education ce tuition rates
[01:06:27 - 01:06:31] for revised courses i have
[01:06:31 - 01:06:31] a motion move to approve
[01:06:35 - 01:06:35] second any discussion i have
[01:06:35 - 01:06:37] a quick question can you
[01:06:37 - 01:06:40] just tell what what are
[01:06:40 - 01:06:40] these tuition rates how do
[01:06:40 - 01:06:43] they compare to you know
[01:06:43 - 01:06:46] inerson classes that kind of
[01:06:46 - 01:06:49] thing i guess generally mr
[01:06:49 - 01:06:49] these are much lower tuition
[01:06:49 - 01:06:51] rates than we would charge
[01:06:51 - 01:06:54] for credit courses at the
[01:06:54 - 01:06:54] institution a lot of them
[01:06:54 - 01:06:56] are personal enrichment courses and
[01:06:56 - 01:07:01] we base that on um
[01:07:01 - 01:07:01] we we don't necessarily make
[01:07:03 - 01:07:03] money on these so we
[01:07:03 - 01:07:05] attempt to break even for
[01:07:05 - 01:07:07] the instructor costs and supplies
[01:07:07 - 01:07:07] etc and that's why you'll
[01:07:07 - 01:07:10] see in in some of
[01:07:10 - 01:07:10] the um notes uh that
[01:07:12 - 01:07:12] there's a break even number
[01:07:12 - 01:07:14] of students that we need
[01:07:14 - 01:07:14] okay so the the the
[01:07:17 - 01:07:17] purpose of this is uh
[01:07:17 - 01:07:19] community outreach as much as
[01:07:19 - 01:07:19] anything else uh yes sir
[01:07:21 - 01:07:21] and i say generally because
[01:07:21 - 01:07:24] oftentimes we'll bring to the
[01:07:24 - 01:07:26] board um new courses or
[01:07:26 - 01:07:26] revised courses that are applicable
[01:07:29 - 01:07:29] to training by twwc etc
[01:07:29 - 01:07:30] those are charged at a
[01:07:30 - 01:07:34] little bit different rate okay
[01:07:34 - 01:07:34] how do we determine like
[01:07:34 - 01:07:36] which courses are going to
[01:07:36 - 01:07:39] be off offered in the
[01:07:39 - 01:07:42] children's college area because like
[01:07:42 - 01:07:42] like robotics and you know
[01:07:42 - 01:07:46] some of the more innovative
[01:07:46 - 01:07:46] things yeah we try to
[01:07:50 - 01:07:50] monitor uh industry or community
[01:07:50 - 01:07:53] trends um and mirror those
[01:07:53 - 01:07:53] and so we have a
[01:07:55 - 01:07:55] vast history of what's made
[01:07:55 - 01:07:57] in the past and what
[01:07:57 - 01:07:57] sorts of things that students
[01:07:59 - 01:07:59] are interested in uh of
[01:07:59 - 01:08:01] course we have great partnerships
[01:08:01 - 01:08:03] with the isds as well
[01:08:03 - 01:08:03] so we we kind of
[01:08:03 - 01:08:04] keep our finger on the
[01:08:04 - 01:08:04] pulse of what the community
[01:08:04 - 01:08:08] would like to see in
[01:08:08 - 01:08:13] regards to those things okay
[01:08:13 - 01:08:13] thank you any other questions
