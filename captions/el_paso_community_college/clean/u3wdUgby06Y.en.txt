[00:11:11 - 00:11:13] okay okay go ahead doc
[00:11:18 - 00:11:18] on 37 so um obviously
[00:11:18 - 00:11:22] the um senate passed senate
[00:11:22 - 00:11:22] bill 37 um which passed
[00:11:22 - 00:11:23] senate bill 37 um which
[00:11:23 - 00:11:26] essentially essentially abolishes the faculty
[00:11:26 - 00:11:30] senate as it is known
[00:11:30 - 00:11:30] um today as of september
[00:11:30 - 00:11:31] 1st um we have been
[00:11:31 - 00:11:35] working closely with our faculty
[00:11:35 - 00:11:35] senate dr and i dr
[00:11:35 - 00:11:37] penley has has been instrumental
[00:11:37 - 00:11:40] in helping us with this
[00:11:40 - 00:11:40] as well as well as
[00:11:40 - 00:11:43] legal counsel um this institution
[00:11:43 - 00:11:45] has long recognize shared governance
[00:11:45 - 00:11:47] we believe in shared governance
[00:11:47 - 00:11:47] um so we have to
[00:11:47 - 00:11:49] move forward with the resolution
[00:11:49 - 00:11:53] in order to be in
[00:11:53 - 00:11:53] compliance with the state um
[00:11:53 - 00:11:55] and we are also moving
[00:11:55 - 00:11:59] forward with all of the
[00:11:59 - 00:11:59] areas that we have to
[00:11:59 - 00:12:02] uh implement by the 1
[00:12:02 - 00:12:02] of september um this includes
[00:12:05 - 00:12:05] uh the board um i
[00:12:05 - 00:12:08] will have to appoint members
[00:12:08 - 00:12:08] of faculty senate including all
[00:12:11 - 00:12:11] the officers um not something
[00:12:11 - 00:12:13] that i was eager to
[00:12:13 - 00:12:13] do but it's what the
[00:12:13 - 00:12:16] law is and so i
[00:12:16 - 00:12:16] will comply with the law
[00:12:16 - 00:12:17] and we will ensure that
[00:12:17 - 00:12:19] we're in full compliance again
[00:12:19 - 00:12:22] legal counsel has provided excellence
[00:12:22 - 00:12:25] guidance for us as we
[00:12:25 - 00:12:25] continue to move forward i
[00:12:25 - 00:12:28] ask miss as well as
[00:12:28 - 00:12:28] as well as her colleague
[00:12:28 - 00:12:31] to provide any insight that
[00:12:31 - 00:12:33] they have regards to the
[00:12:33 - 00:12:36] resolution i have a question
[00:12:36 - 00:12:36] out of this in the
[00:12:36 - 00:12:39] re the reappoint is the
[00:12:39 - 00:12:41] structure the organizational structure the
[00:12:41 - 00:12:43] line the chart organizational chart
[00:12:43 - 00:12:46] for the senate will it
[00:12:46 - 00:12:46] remain the same are you
[00:12:50 - 00:12:52] designating new positions reigning responsibilities
[00:12:52 - 00:12:54] whatever your responsibility with the
[00:12:54 - 00:12:56] or you going to say
[00:12:56 - 00:12:56] the sin is now organized
[00:12:56 - 00:12:59] and composed as previously we
[00:12:59 - 00:13:00] would have loved to have
[00:13:00 - 00:13:00] done it that way we're
[00:13:02 - 00:13:02] not allowed to do it
[00:13:02 - 00:13:04] that way so um miss
[00:13:04 - 00:13:04] maren myself other members of
[00:13:04 - 00:13:05] the miss maren myself other
[00:13:05 - 00:13:06] members of the institution institution
[00:13:09 - 00:13:09] um went to uh austin
[00:13:09 - 00:13:13] this past friday um to
[00:13:13 - 00:13:13] hear from tasby um tech
[00:13:14 - 00:13:14] association of school boards who
[00:13:17 - 00:13:17] provides um our legal policies
[00:13:17 - 00:13:19] um and get insight from
[00:13:19 - 00:13:22] them they made it very
[00:13:22 - 00:13:22] clear um that the reading
[00:13:22 - 00:13:24] is that i am responsible
[00:13:24 - 00:13:26] of appointing approximately a third
[00:13:26 - 00:13:29] of the faculty senate it
[00:13:29 - 00:13:29] can be comprised of up
[00:13:29 - 00:13:32] to 60 members of which
[00:13:32 - 00:13:35] um each of the respective
[00:13:35 - 00:13:35] um divisions will appoint a
[00:13:38 - 00:13:38] member or elect a member
[00:13:38 - 00:13:42] rather and then i appoint
[00:13:42 - 00:13:42] um so the constitution of
[00:13:42 - 00:13:44] the composition of faculty senate
[00:13:44 - 00:13:47] will will change the officers
[00:13:47 - 00:13:49] i am responsible for appointing
[00:13:49 - 00:13:49] they can serve up to
[00:13:49 - 00:13:52] six one-year terms and then
[00:13:52 - 00:13:54] they have to sit out
[00:13:54 - 00:13:54] for a two-year period those
[00:13:57 - 00:13:57] senators that are elected can
[00:13:57 - 00:13:59] be elected for one two-year
[00:13:59 - 00:13:59] term and then they have
[00:14:01 - 00:14:01] to sit out for two
[00:14:01 - 00:14:05] years after that term um
[00:14:05 - 00:14:05] and we obviously are working
[00:14:07 - 00:14:07] with faculty senate so that
[00:14:07 - 00:14:11] they can have their elections
[00:14:11 - 00:14:13] and have one they're looking
[00:14:13 - 00:14:14] at one-year terms and two-year
[00:14:14 - 00:14:14] terms so they're not all
[00:14:17 - 00:14:17] rolling over at the same
[00:14:17 - 00:14:19] time um as far as
[00:14:19 - 00:14:19] the organization of the faculty
[00:14:21 - 00:14:21] senate that will it can
[00:14:21 - 00:14:23] be no more than 60
[00:14:23 - 00:14:23] members we anticipate that ours
[00:14:23 - 00:14:26] will be approximately 42 members
[00:14:26 - 00:14:26] if i'm not be approximately
[00:14:26 - 00:14:27] 42 members if i'm not
[00:14:27 - 00:14:30] mistaken mistaken um and again
[00:14:30 - 00:14:31] we're moving forward in that
[00:14:31 - 00:14:32] direction is that a significant
[00:14:32 - 00:14:34] change from what we had
[00:14:36 - 00:14:36] i mean what what exists
[00:14:36 - 00:14:36] today is the i mean
[00:14:36 - 00:14:37] what what exists today is
[00:14:37 - 00:14:40] the old old um what
[00:14:40 - 00:14:40] exists today is the faculty
[00:14:41 - 00:14:43] center as was elected september
[00:14:43 - 00:14:45] one yeah as september 2nd
[00:14:45 - 00:14:48] is there a significant change
[00:14:48 - 00:14:51] in the organization the the
[00:14:51 - 00:14:52] leadership of the senate the
[00:14:52 - 00:14:52] the leadership of the senate
[00:14:53 - 00:14:58] okay okay any other questions
[00:15:01 - 00:15:01] m do you have any
[00:15:01 - 00:15:04] anything to add um just
[00:15:04 - 00:15:04] that we we need to
[00:15:04 - 00:15:08] adopt this the the law
[00:15:08 - 00:15:08] requires that the college if
[00:15:11 - 00:15:11] it's going to recognize a
[00:15:11 - 00:15:15] faculty senate that it be
[00:15:15 - 00:15:20] done by september 1st there
[00:15:20 - 00:15:20] is uh tasby is working
[00:15:20 - 00:15:22] on a a permanent policy
[00:15:22 - 00:15:24] with regard to that that
[00:15:24 - 00:15:24] you'll have and receive at
[00:15:24 - 00:15:26] some point in the probably
[00:15:26 - 00:15:29] late fall early winter the
[00:15:29 - 00:15:32] policy that we've attached is
[00:15:32 - 00:15:32] an interim policy it follows
[00:15:32 - 00:15:34] this the very closely the
[00:15:34 - 00:15:36] language of the statute and
[00:15:36 - 00:15:36] the requirements of what the
[00:15:37 - 00:15:37] college has to do with
[00:15:37 - 00:15:40] regard to the faculty senate
[00:15:40 - 00:15:40] uh but it is a
[00:15:40 - 00:15:43] temporary policy for all intents
[00:15:43 - 00:15:46] and purposes because the pol
[00:15:46 - 00:15:47] the college uses tasby for
[00:15:47 - 00:15:47] all of its policies it's
[00:15:47 - 00:15:51] just not ready so we've
[00:15:51 - 00:15:56] drafted together with administration the
[00:15:56 - 00:15:56] board policy 2 01 02
[00:15:59 - 00:15:59] 2 actually administration drafted it
[00:15:59 - 00:16:02] and we reviewed this policy
[00:16:02 - 00:16:04] and and that's what we're
[00:16:04 - 00:16:07] proposing it's important that you
[00:16:07 - 00:16:10] have also a resolution that
[00:16:10 - 00:16:10] i've given you today uh
[00:16:10 - 00:16:13] and that that become part
[00:16:13 - 00:16:17] of the board's record along
[00:16:17 - 00:16:17] with the policy so that
[00:16:17 - 00:16:20] it's clear in the pol
[00:16:20 - 00:16:20] in the minutes of the
[00:16:20 - 00:16:22] board that this resolution has
[00:16:22 - 00:16:25] been adopted and that the
[00:16:25 - 00:16:27] board has recognized the continuation
[00:16:27 - 00:16:30] of the faculty senate do
[00:16:30 - 00:16:30] we need to read the
[00:16:30 - 00:16:32] resolution i think it's best
[00:16:32 - 00:16:32] judge to have a clear
[00:16:33 - 00:16:36] record in the minutes okay
[00:16:36 - 00:16:39] got a bill do we
[00:16:39 - 00:16:39] need to vote or you
[00:16:39 - 00:16:40] have a first and a
[00:16:40 - 00:16:42] second you'll read it first
[00:16:42 - 00:16:44] and then and then the
[00:16:44 - 00:16:44] board will vote to adopt
[00:16:44 - 00:16:45] or not the board will
[00:16:45 - 00:16:46] vote to adopt or not
[00:16:46 - 00:16:48] adopt adopt resolution authorizing the
[00:16:48 - 00:16:51] continuation and ratification of the
[00:16:51 - 00:16:53] faculty senate whereas during the
[00:16:53 - 00:16:55] 89th texas legislative session in
[00:16:55 - 00:16:58] 2025 the texas legislature passed
[00:16:58 - 00:17:00] senate bill 37 which was
[00:17:00 - 00:17:00] subsequently signed into law by
[00:17:03 - 00:17:03] governor greg abbott on june
[00:17:03 - 00:17:06] 20 2025 whereas senate bill
[00:17:06 - 00:17:07] 37 relates to the governance
[00:17:07 - 00:17:10] of public institutions of higher
[00:17:10 - 00:17:12] education including review of curriculum

[00:19:15 - 00:19:17] paso county community college district
[00:19:19 - 00:19:20] anybody have any other questions
[00:19:23 - 00:19:23] if i understand this 33
[00:19:25 - 00:19:28] 51 3522 acknowledges that that
[00:19:28 - 00:19:30] it's discretionary at each institution
[00:19:32 - 00:19:32] whether it will have effect
[00:19:35 - 00:19:35] or not but if they
[00:19:35 - 00:19:35] do they they set out
[00:19:38 - 00:19:40] organizational structure which you identify
[00:19:40 - 00:19:40] is that correct because there's
[00:19:42 - 00:19:42] some i guess there's some
[00:19:42 - 00:19:45] institutions some colleges or that
[00:19:45 - 00:19:46] don't have a is that
[00:19:46 - 00:19:48] correct that's correctum it spells
[00:19:48 - 00:19:51] out very clearly that the
[00:19:51 - 00:19:54] faculty senate is purely an
[00:19:54 - 00:19:54] advisory board that they have
[00:19:56 - 00:19:56] no authority in any of
[00:19:56 - 00:20:00] the actions of the institution
[00:20:00 - 00:20:02] it's very specific um but
[00:20:02 - 00:20:03] again from my perspective and
[00:20:03 - 00:20:05] from the administration's perspective we
[00:20:05 - 00:20:07] believe in shared governance and
[00:20:07 - 00:20:09] we believe that it's important
[00:20:09 - 00:20:10] for the institution to continue
[00:20:10 - 00:20:12] but it's discretionary whether we
[00:20:12 - 00:20:12] have one or not that's
[00:20:12 - 00:20:13] correct we have one or
[00:20:14 - 00:20:15] not that's correct okay okay
[00:20:17 - 00:20:17] okay by by voting on

[00:21:05 - 00:21:07] julie penley vice president of
[00:21:07 - 00:21:08] research accreditation and planning will
[00:21:08 - 00:21:10] make a presentation on the
[00:21:10 - 00:21:10] update of the college district's
[00:21:38 - 00:21:38] um this presentation is a
[00:21:38 - 00:21:42] quick overview of where uh
[00:21:42 - 00:21:44] we have been and and
[00:21:44 - 00:21:44] where you have as a
[00:21:44 - 00:21:47] board uh where we are
[00:21:47 - 00:21:47] as of today and where
[00:21:47 - 00:21:49] we are moving forward with
[00:21:49 - 00:21:52] our next strategic plan before
[00:21:52 - 00:21:52] i get started a huge
[00:21:52 - 00:21:56] shout out to rachel baes
[00:21:56 - 00:21:59] in dr smith's office for
[00:21:59 - 00:21:59] drafting the visuals there is
[00:21:59 - 00:22:03] no way i could have
[00:22:03 - 00:22:05] done this myself so um
[00:22:05 - 00:22:05] so this is the crux
[00:22:05 - 00:22:07] of the presentation um and
[00:22:07 - 00:22:08] and if you're crunched for
[00:22:08 - 00:22:08] time we can stop here
[00:22:08 - 00:22:11] and and we can move
[00:22:11 - 00:22:11] on but uh you might
[00:22:15 - 00:22:15] remember last summer um i
[00:22:15 - 00:22:18] came to you during your
[00:22:18 - 00:22:18] uh summer retreat and i
[00:22:20 - 00:22:20] presented at that time the
[00:22:20 - 00:22:23] current mission and vision statement
[00:22:23 - 00:22:25] and uh i asked you
[00:22:25 - 00:22:25] to put your thinking caps
[00:22:25 - 00:22:28] on and make some decisions
[00:22:28 - 00:22:31] whether those statements were still
[00:22:31 - 00:22:33] uh accurate in in the
[00:22:33 - 00:22:33] next five years or whether
[00:22:33 - 00:22:38] you might want to revise
[00:22:38 - 00:22:38] them um after that uh
[00:22:40 - 00:22:44] cabinet uh began talking about
[00:22:44 - 00:22:44] um the the structure of
[00:22:47 - 00:22:47] our work in the near
[00:22:47 - 00:22:50] future uh taking a page
[00:22:50 - 00:22:50] out of dr saja's book
[00:22:50 - 00:22:51] uh with the four pillars
[00:22:51 - 00:22:54] of student success that that
[00:22:54 - 00:22:54] we talked about at the
[00:22:54 - 00:22:56] retreat uh with entry progress
[00:22:56 - 00:22:58] completion and career so while
[00:22:58 - 00:23:00] you were doing your homework
[00:23:00 - 00:23:00] with the mission and vision
[00:23:00 - 00:23:02] we were doing our homework
[00:23:02 - 00:23:05] uh beginning to craft some
[00:23:05 - 00:23:07] general statements um and general
[00:23:07 - 00:23:09] goals and outcomes that hopefully
[00:23:09 - 00:23:09] would align with that mission
[00:23:11 - 00:23:11] and vision so we were
[00:23:11 - 00:23:14] we were working together during
[00:23:14 - 00:23:14] uh during that part of
[00:23:18 - 00:23:18] 2024 um earlier this year
[00:23:18 - 00:23:22] uh the board came together
[00:23:22 - 00:23:24] and uh finalized and ultimately
[00:23:24 - 00:23:24] approved the new mission and
[00:23:28 - 00:23:28] mission statement and uh at
[00:23:28 - 00:23:38] that time i didn't know
[00:23:38 - 00:23:38] if i needed to use
[00:23:38 - 00:23:41] my teacher voice um once
[00:23:41 - 00:23:42] we had the green light
[00:23:42 - 00:23:42] in terms of mission and
[00:23:42 - 00:23:46] vision then we were able
[00:23:46 - 00:23:48] to begin finalizing uh the
[00:23:48 - 00:23:48] goals and outcomes that together
[00:23:50 - 00:23:50] with your statements created the
[00:23:53 - 00:23:53] skeleton of our strategic plan
[00:23:57 - 00:23:57] that plan is uh in
[00:23:57 - 00:24:00] its very final stages uh
[00:24:00 - 00:24:00] with dr mo and uh
[00:24:00 - 00:24:03] director christy frescus on the
[00:24:03 - 00:24:04] uh visuals that will be
[00:24:05 - 00:24:05] presented and provided to the
[00:24:05 - 00:24:07] college employees and and to
[00:24:07 - 00:24:08] you as well as to
[00:24:10 - 00:24:10] our external stakeholders uh the

[00:24:22 - 00:24:22] college will be creating their
[00:24:22 - 00:24:26] new uh annual area plan
[00:24:26 - 00:24:28] for 2526 in alignment and

[00:26:07 - 00:26:11] a student success um and

[00:27:08 - 00:27:12] holistic college experience um to
[00:27:12 - 00:27:12] help not only the individual
[00:27:14 - 00:27:14] student but their families the
[00:27:17 - 00:27:17] community uh and the the
[00:27:17 - 00:27:24] region that we and this
[00:27:24 - 00:27:24] uh is not a statement
[00:27:24 - 00:27:28] that you all um have
[00:27:28 - 00:27:28] approved your your uh focus
[00:27:29 - 00:27:29] is on the mission and
[00:27:29 - 00:27:35] vision as it should be
[00:27:35 - 00:27:35] uh but we took that
[00:27:35 - 00:27:37] um vision if you will
[00:27:37 - 00:27:37] that that philosophy of epcc
[00:27:40 - 00:27:40] a step further by generating
[00:27:40 - 00:27:42] a student success statement uh
[00:27:42 - 00:27:42] we used to have an
[00:27:45 - 00:27:45] equity statement for reasons that
[00:27:45 - 00:27:47] we will not discuss we
[00:27:47 - 00:27:50] are not uh touting it
[00:27:50 - 00:27:50] as an equity statement the
[00:27:50 - 00:27:52] spirit of this is is
[00:27:52 - 00:27:52] very similar though we we
[00:27:55 - 00:27:55] see students as individuals uh
[00:27:55 - 00:27:57] and and the heart of
[00:27:57 - 00:27:57] this statement is in the
[00:27:59 - 00:27:59] last sentence uh we are
[00:27:59 - 00:28:04] committed to success for every
[00:28:04 - 00:28:06] student and um for creating
[00:28:06 - 00:28:09] opportunities for that student and
[00:28:09 - 00:28:09] providing resources and support for
[00:28:13 - 00:28:13] that student um so again
[00:28:13 - 00:28:15] your role as a board
[00:28:15 - 00:28:15] is to uh give us
[00:28:15 - 00:28:17] direction through the mission and
[00:28:17 - 00:28:20] vision you did that beautifully
[00:28:20 - 00:28:20] we uh added the student
[00:28:22 - 00:28:22] success statement to double down
[00:28:22 - 00:28:25] on our commitment to uh
[00:28:25 - 00:28:27] supporting every student meeting them
[00:28:27 - 00:28:30] where they are and now
[00:28:30 - 00:28:30] we're ready to go back
[00:28:30 - 00:28:32] to the goals and outcomes
[00:28:32 - 00:28:33] again this is something that
[00:28:33 - 00:28:35] cabinet worked on there was
[00:28:35 - 00:28:35] a lot of back and
[00:28:35 - 00:28:38] forth a lot of intentional
[00:28:38 - 00:28:40] conversations um how we would
[00:28:40 - 00:28:43] support those four pillars that
[00:28:43 - 00:28:43] dr sata has mentioned um
[00:28:46 - 00:28:46] in multiple presentations and how
[00:28:46 - 00:28:48] we can get a little
[00:28:48 - 00:28:48] bit more specific in what
[00:28:52 - 00:28:52] it means to meet a
[00:28:52 - 00:28:52] goal of progress or a
[00:28:55 - 00:28:55] goal of completion so this
[00:28:55 - 00:28:57] is what we will be
[00:28:57 - 00:28:57] rolling out with our strategic
[00:29:00 - 00:29:00] plan um what you may
[00:29:00 - 00:29:02] notice um particularly for returning
[00:29:02 - 00:29:05] trustees is we now have
[00:29:05 - 00:29:08] some quantifiable metrics associated with
[00:29:08 - 00:29:11] these outcomes uh to better
[00:29:11 - 00:29:11] provide budget heads uh and
[00:29:13 - 00:29:13] everyone at the college with
[00:29:13 - 00:29:16] some um clear tracking if
[00:29:16 - 00:29:16] you will uh of of
[00:29:16 - 00:29:18] how we are doing towards
[00:29:18 - 00:29:22] achieving these goals many of
[00:29:22 - 00:29:22] these goals uh align with
[00:29:24 - 00:29:24] what the support what the
[00:29:24 - 00:29:27] state has identified as valuable
[00:29:27 - 00:29:30] in terms of funding formulas
[00:29:30 - 00:29:30] um it also aligns with
[00:29:32 - 00:29:32] some of our existing work
[00:29:32 - 00:29:35] with our quality enhancement plan
[00:29:35 - 00:29:37] so although the words maybe
[00:29:37 - 00:29:38] some of the metrics may
[00:29:41 - 00:29:41] appear new to employees or
[00:29:41 - 00:29:43] or perhaps to you they're
[00:29:43 - 00:29:45] really a continuation and an
[00:29:45 - 00:29:45] explication of the work we've
[00:29:45 - 00:29:48] been doing for for years
[00:29:50 - 00:29:50] um some of you have
[00:29:50 - 00:29:52] probably noticed there's an asterisk
[00:29:52 - 00:29:54] at the very bottom uh
[00:29:54 - 00:29:54] that one does not have
[00:29:54 - 00:29:56] a metric associated with it
[00:29:56 - 00:29:56] i will come back to
[00:29:59 - 00:29:59] that because you'll see that
[00:29:59 - 00:30:04] um outcome on each of
[00:30:04 - 00:30:04] our goals so um any
[00:30:04 - 00:30:05] on each of our goals
[00:30:05 - 00:30:05] so um any questions questions
[00:30:08 - 00:30:08] uh or comments about the
[00:30:08 - 00:30:17] outcomes okay uh moving on
[00:30:17 - 00:30:18] to progress uh as students
[00:30:18 - 00:30:18] not only have come to
[00:30:18 - 00:30:22] the college and and identified
[00:30:22 - 00:30:24] their area of concentration how
[00:30:24 - 00:30:24] we can get them to
[00:30:25 - 00:30:25] successfully complete that first half
[00:30:26 - 00:30:29] of their program uh so
[00:30:29 - 00:30:31] we identified some some key
[00:30:31 - 00:30:31] metrics that we have found
[00:30:31 - 00:30:33] to be important in that
[00:30:33 - 00:30:36] student success during those critical
[00:30:36 - 00:30:38] uh first semesters a lot
[00:30:38 - 00:30:38] of this is supported by
[00:30:41 - 00:30:41] national research um uh you
[00:30:41 - 00:30:43] may have heard dr set
[00:30:43 - 00:30:43] out to talk about uh
[00:30:45 - 00:30:45] gateway courses in english and
[00:30:45 - 00:30:47] math tend to be bottlenecks
[00:30:47 - 00:30:47] for students so we we
[00:30:50 - 00:30:50] brought that to the forefront
[00:30:50 - 00:30:52] of some of our focus
[00:30:55 - 00:30:55] um dual credit is also
[00:30:55 - 00:30:59] a growing uh population and
[00:30:59 - 00:30:59] is something that is uh
[00:31:02 - 00:31:02] you heard from dean bado
[00:31:02 - 00:31:03] uh last week about the
[00:31:03 - 00:31:03] growth in dual credit so
[00:31:04 - 00:31:06] we we want to uh
[00:31:06 - 00:31:09] bring that to the forefront
[00:31:09 - 00:31:09] as well and again you'll
[00:31:09 - 00:31:13] see that uh catchall final
[00:31:13 - 00:31:21] outcome of so once we
[00:31:21 - 00:31:23] uh have students and supported
[00:31:23 - 00:31:24] students successfully through their first
[00:31:24 - 00:31:24] half of the program our
[00:31:26 - 00:31:26] work is obviously not done
[00:31:26 - 00:31:29] and so our completion goal
[00:31:29 - 00:31:32] focuses on getting students to
[00:31:32 - 00:31:35] complete their reward um and
[00:31:35 - 00:31:35] so these types of outcomes
[00:31:35 - 00:31:37] focus on that second half
[00:31:37 - 00:31:40] of a student's program uh
[00:31:40 - 00:31:43] obviously the total awards um
[00:31:43 - 00:31:43] not just an award for
[00:31:43 - 00:31:46] an award's sake but an
[00:31:46 - 00:31:46] award in a meaningful high
[00:31:46 - 00:31:50] demand uh high wage program
[00:31:50 - 00:31:50] in our area uh we
[00:31:54 - 00:31:54] we obviously don't want students
[00:31:54 - 00:31:57] to um rack up a
[00:31:57 - 00:31:57] lot of of credits or
[00:31:57 - 00:31:59] a lot of hours that
[00:31:59 - 00:31:59] are not going to meet
[00:31:59 - 00:32:01] their needs and so we
[00:32:01 - 00:32:01] we brought that in as
[00:32:02 - 00:32:06] a fourth outcome and then
[00:32:06 - 00:32:06] that last outcome uh which
[00:32:06 - 00:32:07] is beginning to look familiar
[00:32:07 - 00:32:09] to you i'm sure supporting
[00:32:09 - 00:32:13] other departments in their goal
[00:32:13 - 00:32:18] efforts and then our last
[00:32:18 - 00:32:18] goal um is um that
[00:32:20 - 00:32:23] continuation in their educational journey
[00:32:23 - 00:32:23] or for students that are
[00:32:23 - 00:32:25] focused more on direct work
[00:32:25 - 00:32:27] uh credentials supporting them in
[00:32:27 - 00:32:31] that arena as well so
[00:32:31 - 00:32:31] this is sort of a
[00:32:31 - 00:32:33] split goal for us um
[00:32:33 - 00:32:33] continuing to work with our
[00:32:33 - 00:32:35] regional uh partners through our
[00:32:35 - 00:32:37] advisory committees and other outlets
[00:32:37 - 00:32:39] to make sure that we
[00:32:39 - 00:32:42] are meeting the community's demand
[00:32:42 - 00:32:46] for highquality program uh training
[00:32:46 - 00:32:46] um lensure rates for many
[00:32:46 - 00:32:47] of our programs is an
[00:32:47 - 00:32:51] important part of getting students
[00:32:51 - 00:32:51] into the workforce um getting
[00:32:52 - 00:32:53] students into the workforce um
[00:32:53 - 00:33:00] transfer transfer so far so
[00:33:00 - 00:33:05] good all right so that
[00:33:05 - 00:33:05] fifth goal um it is
[00:33:09 - 00:33:09] uh designed to help um
[00:33:09 - 00:33:13] divisions such as mine um
[00:33:13 - 00:33:13] perhaps uh such as uh
[00:33:15 - 00:33:17] information technology finance and administrative
[00:33:17 - 00:33:20] operations we don't have many
[00:33:20 - 00:33:23] opportunities to directly interact interact
[00:33:23 - 00:33:23] with students um our role
[00:33:23 - 00:33:27] is more of a support
[00:33:27 - 00:33:27] um function and so in
[00:33:30 - 00:33:30] order for us to see
[00:33:30 - 00:33:33] ourselves in our strategic plan
[00:33:33 - 00:33:33] and to make um important
[00:33:37 - 00:33:37] and meaningful area plans we
[00:33:37 - 00:33:41] added this uh this outcome
[00:33:41 - 00:33:41] as a way to provide
[00:33:41 - 00:33:44] that support whether it's uh
[00:33:44 - 00:33:47] by partnering with the education
[00:33:47 - 00:33:48] workforce division or partnering with
[00:33:48 - 00:33:51] student and enrollment services or
[00:33:51 - 00:33:56] partnering with one another um
[00:33:56 - 00:33:56] to create ways to fulfill
[00:33:56 - 00:33:59] the strategic plan goals and
[00:33:59 - 00:34:02] outcomes um for example um
[00:34:02 - 00:34:04] my uh the institutional research
[00:34:04 - 00:34:04] department which is in my
[00:34:07 - 00:34:07] division the director uh came
[00:34:07 - 00:34:09] to me yesterday and said
[00:34:09 - 00:34:13] what do you think about
[00:34:13 - 00:34:13] creating some better dashboards to
[00:34:15 - 00:34:15] track each one of these
[00:34:15 - 00:34:18] outcomes and i said that
[00:34:18 - 00:34:18] would be terrific and maybe
[00:34:21 - 00:34:21] you could work with it
[00:34:21 - 00:34:23] to help um that department
[00:34:23 - 00:34:23] we can come together and
[00:34:26 - 00:34:26] create a really powerful um
[00:34:26 - 00:34:29] dashboard uh whether it's in
[00:34:29 - 00:34:30] enhancing our current structure or
[00:34:30 - 00:34:33] creating something new so that
[00:34:33 - 00:34:33] everybody can easily track this
[00:34:36 - 00:34:36] work and not get um
[00:34:36 - 00:34:39] lost in the wilderness if
[00:34:39 - 00:34:41] you will so that's why
[00:34:41 - 00:34:41] that's why that outcome is
[00:34:45 - 00:34:45] there and that is all
[00:34:45 - 00:34:46] i had i am happy
[00:34:48 - 00:34:48] to answer any questions we
[00:34:48 - 00:34:50] we are so excited about
[00:34:50 - 00:34:50] this strategic plan or or
[00:34:52 - 00:34:52] i am so excited about
[00:34:52 - 00:34:54] this strategic plan um and
[00:34:54 - 00:34:54] i hope that that comes
[00:34:54 - 00:34:55] plan um and i hope
[00:34:55 - 00:34:56] that that comes through through
[00:34:57 - 00:34:57] i i have a question
[00:34:58 - 00:35:03] yes sir how did we
[00:35:03 - 00:35:03] do uh up to 2024
[00:35:03 - 00:35:04] on our past strategic plan
[00:35:07 - 00:35:07] did we meet every goal
[00:35:07 - 00:35:08] 100 did we meet every
[00:35:08 - 00:35:12] goal 100 um um i
[00:35:12 - 00:35:12] do not have that number
[00:35:12 - 00:35:16] with me i would say
[00:35:16 - 00:35:16] um likely not because we
[00:35:16 - 00:35:18] did not have specific numbers
[00:35:18 - 00:35:19] for the for the current
[00:35:19 - 00:35:20] strategic plan that still is
[00:35:22 - 00:35:22] in place until august 31st
[00:35:22 - 00:35:24] we are gathering some baseline
[00:35:24 - 00:35:27] data right now which will
[00:35:27 - 00:35:27] serve not only to guide
[00:35:27 - 00:35:29] us on this incoming strategic
[00:35:29 - 00:35:32] plan but it will tell
[00:35:32 - 00:35:32] us where we are on
[00:35:32 - 00:35:32] the current tell us where
[00:35:32 - 00:35:33] we are on the current
[00:35:33 - 00:35:36] plan plan so uh maybe
[00:35:36 - 00:35:36] in one of the upcoming
[00:35:36 - 00:35:38] board meetings you can bring
[00:35:38 - 00:35:38] us up to date and
[00:35:40 - 00:35:40] let us know how we
[00:35:40 - 00:35:40] did on the past or
[00:35:43 - 00:35:43] sure sure absolutely happy to
[00:35:43 - 00:35:46] do that so that we
[00:35:46 - 00:35:50] don't skip something we missed
[00:35:50 - 00:35:50] in our next five years
[00:35:50 - 00:35:50] missed in our next five
[00:35:51 - 00:35:53] years absolutely absolutely no i
[00:35:53 - 00:35:53] think that's um a great
[00:35:56 - 00:35:56] suggestion judge um we had
[00:35:56 - 00:35:58] some in our strategic plan
[00:35:58 - 00:35:58] which at the time that
[00:35:58 - 00:36:01] we voted made sense for
[00:36:01 - 00:36:03] the institution it was prior
[00:36:03 - 00:36:03] to certain laws passing um
[00:36:06 - 00:36:06] and so some of them
[00:36:06 - 00:36:06] it's not in our best
[00:36:10 - 00:36:10] interest to um to report
[00:36:10 - 00:36:12] on i'll give an example
[00:36:12 - 00:36:12] so our goals and outcomes
[00:36:15 - 00:36:15] goal two is drive student
[00:36:15 - 00:36:17] success but is absolutely correct
[00:36:17 - 00:36:20] we have specific metrics um
[00:36:20 - 00:36:20] but we can provide data
[00:36:20 - 00:36:22] on those but for instance
[00:36:22 - 00:36:24] one of the goals under
[00:36:24 - 00:36:26] driving student success was close
[00:36:26 - 00:36:26] equity gaps in student outcomes
[00:36:29 - 00:36:29] uh that in today's uh
[00:36:29 - 00:36:31] body politic is not something
[00:36:31 - 00:36:31] that we would be reporting
[00:36:34 - 00:36:34] on which is based on
[00:36:34 - 00:36:37] senate bill 17 that passed
[00:36:37 - 00:36:37] in 2023 um but there's
[00:36:37 - 00:36:38] others that we can you
[00:36:38 - 00:36:41] know facilitating college transitions preparing
[00:36:41 - 00:36:42] students with marketable skills for
[00:36:42 - 00:36:45] gainful employment um but we
[00:36:45 - 00:36:50] can we can bring um
[00:36:50 - 00:36:50] a report to the board
[00:36:50 - 00:36:52] and and show you as
[00:36:52 - 00:36:52] as we launch this one
[00:36:52 - 00:36:55] this one will launch uh
[00:36:55 - 00:36:55] the 1 of september and
[00:36:55 - 00:36:56] we can bring we can
[00:36:56 - 00:36:56] make sure that we have
[00:36:59 - 00:36:59] time in the fall to
[00:36:59 - 00:37:02] report to the board where
[00:37:02 - 00:37:02] we were on meeting those
[00:37:02 - 00:37:05] at the same time i
[00:37:05 - 00:37:06] remind the board that that
[00:37:08 - 00:37:08] strategic plan was during the
[00:37:08 - 00:37:09] um strategic plan was during
[00:37:09 - 00:37:12] the um pandmic pandmic i
[00:37:12 - 00:37:12] give dr pley a whole
[00:37:12 - 00:37:14] lot of credit for getting
[00:37:14 - 00:37:14] that strategic plan up and
[00:37:17 - 00:37:17] running and through during the
[00:37:17 - 00:37:20] pandemic but i'm i'm sure
[00:37:20 - 00:37:20] there are goals that we
[00:37:24 - 00:37:24] didn't meet with enrollment goals
[00:37:24 - 00:37:26] etc that the pandmic affected
[00:37:28 - 00:37:28] and remind me again how
[00:37:28 - 00:37:31] do how do we monitor
[00:37:31 - 00:37:35] the progress we're making so
[00:37:35 - 00:37:35] the the um excellent question
[00:37:35 - 00:37:38] mrs moy and the the
[00:37:38 - 00:37:41] strategic plan is so exciting
[00:37:41 - 00:37:41] because it is going to
[00:37:41 - 00:37:43] be how the budget heads
[00:37:43 - 00:37:46] are going to create their
[00:37:46 - 00:37:46] area plan so uh myself
[00:37:46 - 00:37:47] my colleagues in the room
[00:37:47 - 00:37:50] any budget head at the
[00:37:50 - 00:37:50] college will be generating a
[00:37:50 - 00:37:52] new area plan for the
[00:37:52 - 00:37:54] academic year they will pick
[00:37:54 - 00:37:54] one of these metrics to
[00:37:54 - 00:37:59] focus on we will have
[00:37:59 - 00:37:59] the baselines um for uh
[00:38:02 - 00:38:02] at the aggregate level they
[00:38:02 - 00:38:02] can uh try at the
[00:38:02 - 00:38:03] aggregate level they can uh
[00:38:03 - 00:38:08] try to to say for
[00:38:08 - 00:38:08] example uh number one on
[00:38:08 - 00:38:10] the screen i'm going to
[00:38:10 - 00:38:10] focus on a an area
[00:38:13 - 00:38:13] plan targeting career exploration in
[00:38:13 - 00:38:14] and out of the classroom
[00:38:14 - 00:38:17] by 5 so we'll have
[00:38:17 - 00:38:17] that baseline number they may
[00:38:17 - 00:38:18] uh they're going to outline
[00:38:18 - 00:38:20] how they're going to do
[00:38:20 - 00:38:23] it they have quarterly updates
[00:38:23 - 00:38:23] that they provide and so
[00:38:23 - 00:38:26] by the end of the
[00:38:26 - 00:38:26] year by um next september
[00:38:29 - 00:38:29] october of 26 they'll have
[00:38:29 - 00:38:31] their baseline data they'll have
[00:38:31 - 00:38:33] where they ended up they'll
[00:38:33 - 00:38:35] have the interim steps along
[00:38:35 - 00:38:35] the way they can say
[00:38:35 - 00:38:39] you know i i did
[00:38:39 - 00:38:39] it yay me or they
[00:38:39 - 00:38:41] can say i didn't quite
[00:38:41 - 00:38:41] hit that mark i want
[00:38:41 - 00:38:43] to extend the plan and
[00:38:43 - 00:38:44] double up my efforts so
[00:38:44 - 00:38:44] it's more at the individual
[00:38:47 - 00:38:47] level but it is uh
[00:38:47 - 00:38:50] accountability through our um actually
[00:38:50 - 00:38:52] through the software that you
[00:38:52 - 00:38:52] all were were so kind
[00:38:54 - 00:38:54] to approve uh at last
[00:38:54 - 00:38:56] week's board meeting that that
[00:38:56 - 00:38:59] software was to document the
[00:38:59 - 00:38:59] planning efforts at the document
[00:38:59 - 00:38:59] the planning efforts at the
[00:38:59 - 00:39:01] college college at any point
[00:39:01 - 00:39:01] they can re-trigger at any
[00:39:01 - 00:39:02] point they can re-trigger evaluation
[00:39:02 - 00:39:04] evaluation absolutely absolutely they don't
[00:39:04 - 00:39:06] have to generate a new
[00:39:06 - 00:39:08] plan every year they are
[00:39:08 - 00:39:08] welcome to or they can
[00:39:08 - 00:39:10] extend the plan sometimes work
[00:39:10 - 00:39:13] takes a little bit more
[00:39:13 - 00:39:13] than a year to to
[00:39:13 - 00:39:15] achieve so when we're doing
[00:39:15 - 00:39:15] any type of expenses do
[00:39:15 - 00:39:17] we point back to how
[00:39:17 - 00:39:20] is this expense going to
[00:39:20 - 00:39:20] tie to this specific action
[00:39:22 - 00:39:22] yes well we we tie
[00:39:22 - 00:39:25] um the planning into the
[00:39:25 - 00:39:26] budget development process so uh
[00:39:26 - 00:39:30] our director of institutional planning
[00:39:30 - 00:39:30] uh comes to the budget
[00:39:30 - 00:39:32] workshop presentations in february to
[00:39:32 - 00:39:34] to align that because it
[00:39:34 - 00:39:38] it is resource allocation and
[00:39:38 - 00:39:38] it it um justifies to
[00:39:38 - 00:39:40] our stakeholders not only how
[00:39:40 - 00:39:42] we're using those resources but
[00:39:42 - 00:39:44] if we might need additional
[00:39:44 - 00:39:47] resources for a specific purpose
[00:39:47 - 00:39:47] not just i i need
[00:39:50 - 00:39:50] more money for xyz but
[00:39:50 - 00:39:52] you know tying everything we
[00:39:52 - 00:39:52] do back to that strategic
[00:39:53 - 00:39:53] plan in support of the
[00:39:53 - 00:39:54] mission and plan in support
[00:39:54 - 00:39:55] of the mission and vision

[00:42:20 - 00:42:23] had said that the main
[00:42:23 - 00:42:25] goal is developing a sustainable
[00:42:25 - 00:42:25] budget well that has not
[00:42:27 - 00:42:27] changed it is still the
[00:42:27 - 00:42:31] main goal to produce a
[00:42:31 - 00:42:33] sustainable budget the other thing
[00:42:33 - 00:42:33] that we talked about were
[00:42:33 - 00:42:37] that on june 25th many
[00:42:37 - 00:42:37] of the numbers that were
[00:42:37 - 00:42:42] presented were preliminary so we're
[00:42:42 - 00:42:42] a little bit over a
[00:42:42 - 00:42:45] month later and the numbers
[00:42:45 - 00:42:47] have firmed up quite a
[00:42:47 - 00:42:47] bit we have better numbers
[00:42:51 - 00:42:54] better estimates for expenditures and
[00:42:54 - 00:42:54] so today we're going to
[00:42:54 - 00:42:57] look at the numbers of
[00:42:57 - 00:42:57] the as they've rolled forward
[00:42:59 - 00:42:59] and uh go over that
[00:42:59 - 00:42:59] in a little bit more
[00:42:59 - 00:43:00] and uh go over that
[00:43:00 - 00:43:01] in a little bit more
[00:43:01 - 00:43:05] detail detail so our agenda
[00:43:05 - 00:43:05] today is is um just
[00:43:05 - 00:43:08] to say that one budget
[00:43:08 - 00:43:11] workshop is under our belt
[00:43:11 - 00:43:11] it's provided on june the
[00:43:11 - 00:43:13] 25th and so now we
[00:43:13 - 00:43:18] have updated the baseline budget
[00:43:18 - 00:43:18] as of june 30th at
[00:43:18 - 00:43:20] the june 25th presentation it
[00:43:20 - 00:43:24] was updated through may the
[00:43:24 - 00:43:24] 31st it is advanced by
[00:43:24 - 00:43:26] one month and we've updated
[00:43:26 - 00:43:29] the revenues for fiscal year
[00:43:29 - 00:43:32] 2425 which become the basis
[00:43:32 - 00:43:35] for the 2526 budget so
[00:43:35 - 00:43:35] it's very important to update
[00:43:38 - 00:43:38] the current revenues to predict
[00:43:38 - 00:43:41] what the revenues might be
[00:43:41 - 00:43:43] for next year in addition
[00:43:43 - 00:43:43] uh dr sat has vetted
[00:43:43 - 00:43:45] the additional request with the
[00:43:45 - 00:43:48] vice presidents that are uh
[00:43:48 - 00:43:49] in attendance presidents that are
[00:43:49 - 00:43:50] uh in attendance today today
[00:43:53 - 00:43:53] and so you're going to
[00:43:53 - 00:43:57] see revised funding strategies based
[00:43:57 - 00:43:59] upon revenue projections and this
[00:43:59 - 00:44:02] will help in your decision-
[00:44:02 - 00:44:02] making later as you consider
[00:44:02 - 00:44:07] a salary increase so then
[00:44:07 - 00:44:07] we will at the end
[00:44:07 - 00:44:09] of the presentation talk about
[00:44:09 - 00:44:12] next steps towards developing a
[00:44:12 - 00:44:15] fiscal year 2526 operating budget
[00:44:18 - 00:44:18] so how does the current
[00:44:18 - 00:44:19] year budget so how does
[00:44:19 - 00:44:20] the current year budget revenues
[00:44:20 - 00:44:22] revenues how do the current
[00:44:22 - 00:44:22] budget year revenues how do
[00:44:23 - 00:44:24] the current budget year revenues
[00:44:24 - 00:44:26] look look so for state
[00:44:26 - 00:44:30] appropriations we see we have
[00:44:30 - 00:44:30] a positive variance of 4
[00:44:30 - 00:44:31] have a positive variance of
[00:44:32 - 00:44:35] 4 million million that is
[00:44:35 - 00:44:37] about 175 that that is
[00:44:37 - 00:44:37] about close to the number
[00:44:40 - 00:44:40] we predicted at the june
[00:44:40 - 00:44:44] 25th budget workshop up 11
[00:44:44 - 00:44:48] 11 uh overhead recovery is
[00:44:48 - 00:44:52] slightly down uh 84 000
[00:44:52 - 00:44:52] a minimal amount and so
[00:44:52 - 00:44:55] when we look at local
[00:44:55 - 00:45:03] funds tuition and fees at
[00:45:03 - 00:45:03] the june 25th presentation they
[00:45:03 - 00:45:07] were up about 3 5
[00:45:07 - 00:45:09] million they were predicted much
[00:45:09 - 00:45:11] higher we have since looked
[00:45:11 - 00:45:12] at our revenue projections and
[00:45:14 - 00:45:14] gotten a better view of
[00:45:14 - 00:45:17] what the summer exemptions are
[00:45:17 - 00:45:20] which exemptions are a contra
[00:45:20 - 00:45:20] revenue account so we adjusted
[00:45:23 - 00:45:23] the tuition and fees we
[00:45:23 - 00:45:26] expect for this year down
[00:45:26 - 00:45:26] uh so that is a
[00:45:26 - 00:45:28] significant difference from what we
[00:45:28 - 00:45:31] reported june the 25th this
[00:45:31 - 00:45:33] is a more accurate prediction
[00:45:33 - 00:45:33] of where the revenues will
[00:45:37 - 00:45:37] be and so uh property
[00:45:37 - 00:45:45] taxes are coming that's a
[00:45:45 - 00:45:46] positive variance of 2 7
[00:45:50 - 00:45:50] million approximately uh 3 6
[00:45:50 - 00:45:51] 65 million approximately uh 3
[00:45:51 - 00:45:54] 6 65 higher higher other
[00:45:54 - 00:45:54] other income is still trending
[00:45:57 - 00:45:57] higher that the large component
[00:45:57 - 00:46:02] of that is interest income
[00:46:02 - 00:46:02] so uh that is 4
[00:46:02 - 00:46:04] 8 million higher it there's
[00:46:04 - 00:46:07] such a large variance because
[00:46:07 - 00:46:11] interest income is uh something
[00:46:11 - 00:46:11] that is hard to predict
[00:46:11 - 00:46:13] and uh very variable so
[00:46:13 - 00:46:16] we budget conservatively for interest
[00:46:16 - 00:46:19] income but interest rates have
[00:46:19 - 00:46:23] remained fairly high the fed
[00:46:23 - 00:46:23] has not changed rates yet
[00:46:25 - 00:46:25] but the world is very
[00:46:25 - 00:46:27] dynamic and that can happen
[00:46:27 - 00:46:27] very quickly so we do
[00:46:27 - 00:46:30] not rely on interest income
[00:46:30 - 00:46:33] as a stable revenue source
[00:46:33 - 00:46:33] but at the moment it's
[00:46:37 - 00:46:37] yielding a nice variance 4
[00:46:37 - 00:46:41] 8 million uh dollars positive
[00:46:41 - 00:46:41] so we come down to
[00:46:44 - 00:46:44] the self-supporting line item it
[00:46:44 - 00:46:47] shows self-supporting shows a budget
[00:46:47 - 00:46:49] of 3 million and we
[00:46:49 - 00:46:53] have revenues predicted of 1
[00:46:53 - 00:46:53] 6 million that shows a
[00:46:53 - 00:46:56] decrease on here but really
[00:46:56 - 00:46:59] because we're showing actual revenues
[00:46:59 - 00:46:59] to budget um it shows
[00:46:59 - 00:47:02] a decrease but the self-supporting
[00:47:04 - 00:47:04] accounts we do not spend
[00:47:04 - 00:47:07] more than the revenue that
[00:47:07 - 00:47:07] comes into them that's a
[00:47:09 - 00:47:09] very important aspect to keep
[00:47:09 - 00:47:11] in mind we are not
[00:47:11 - 00:47:11] going to go into any
[00:47:11 - 00:47:12] kind of deficit when it
[00:47:12 - 00:47:15] comes to self-supporting we only
[00:47:15 - 00:47:17] spend and monitor those accounts
[00:47:17 - 00:47:22] very closely in uh in
[00:47:22 - 00:47:22] that area so overall the
[00:47:22 - 00:47:26] way that revenues look they
[00:47:26 - 00:47:26] we have a uh increase
[00:47:31 - 00:47:31] of 11 9 million almost
[00:47:31 - 00:47:34] 12 million over budgeted revenues
[00:47:34 - 00:47:37] yes sir just because i'm
[00:47:37 - 00:47:40] old and i forget things
[00:47:40 - 00:47:40] can you just couple examples
[00:47:40 - 00:47:41] of what self-supporting really is
[00:47:41 - 00:47:43] i mean what are those
[00:47:46 - 00:47:46] sure sure so uh many
[00:47:46 - 00:47:48] times the workforce area is
[00:47:48 - 00:47:50] very dynamic it wants to
[00:47:50 - 00:47:50] respond to industry demand to
[00:47:50 - 00:47:50] respond to industry demand okay
[00:47:50 - 00:47:52] okay so they want to
[00:47:52 - 00:47:52] pilot a program to see
[00:47:55 - 00:47:55] if it's viable and if
[00:47:55 - 00:47:57] it's viable uh the rules
[00:47:57 - 00:47:57] call for them mainstreaming that
[00:48:00 - 00:48:00] account into the operating budget
[00:48:02 - 00:48:02] okay i understand i'm just
[00:48:03 - 00:48:03] misconception when you say supporting
[00:48:03 - 00:48:06] misconception when you say supporting
[00:48:06 - 00:48:09] program program yes sir are
[00:48:09 - 00:48:12] there any other questions about
[00:48:12 - 00:48:15] this slide so the takeaway
[00:48:15 - 00:48:15] from here is when we
[00:48:19 - 00:48:19] look at um budgeted revenue
[00:48:19 - 00:48:21] is 166 5 million compared
[00:48:21 - 00:48:23] to what actually we predict
[00:48:23 - 00:48:23] is going to come in
[00:48:23 - 00:48:26] there's a positive variance of
[00:48:26 - 00:48:26] almost 12 million positive variance
[00:48:27 - 00:48:28] of almost 12 million 719
[00:48:28 - 00:48:38] 719 719 increase so looking
[00:48:38 - 00:48:38] at the current year as
[00:48:38 - 00:48:42] well how that's going to
[00:48:42 - 00:48:42] uh wind up this is
[00:48:45 - 00:48:45] our prediction for how operations
[00:48:45 - 00:48:47] are going to finish this
[00:48:47 - 00:48:50] year this particular slide incorporates
[00:48:50 - 00:48:53] revenues and our projected re
[00:48:53 - 00:48:56] expenditures so we see that
[00:48:56 - 00:48:56] we have brought forward we
[00:48:56 - 00:48:58] have brought forward the projected
[00:48:58 - 00:49:04] revenues of 178 5 million
[00:49:04 - 00:49:04] which is a positive variance
[00:49:04 - 00:49:06] of almost 12 million we
[00:49:06 - 00:49:08] saw that on the previous
[00:49:08 - 00:49:10] slide so now what we
[00:49:10 - 00:49:10] do over here we estimate
[00:49:13 - 00:49:13] expenditures and we estimate our
[00:49:16 - 00:49:16] expenditures to come in at
[00:49:16 - 00:49:17] 148 6 expenditures to come
[00:49:17 - 00:49:18] in at 148 6 million
[00:49:18 - 00:49:20] million resulting in a positive
[00:49:20 - 00:49:24] variance of 29 8 8
[00:49:24 - 00:49:24] million for the year that's
[00:49:24 - 00:49:27] our prediction uh the surplus
[00:49:27 - 00:49:30] that is resulting from this
[00:49:30 - 00:49:32] uh helps to bolster fund
[00:49:32 - 00:49:32] balance which is looked on
[00:49:32 - 00:49:36] very positively by sac coc
[00:49:36 - 00:49:39] rating agencies and also allows
[00:49:39 - 00:49:41] us to continue the practice
[00:49:41 - 00:49:44] of supporting deferred maintenance projects
[00:49:44 - 00:49:47] in the plant funds so
[00:49:47 - 00:49:47] we have a lot of
[00:49:47 - 00:49:47] uh need in the area
[00:49:50 - 00:49:50] of maintaining buildings and grounds
[00:49:50 - 00:49:53] so forth so the college
[00:49:53 - 00:49:56] uh is very fortunate this
[00:49:56 - 00:49:56] year and and last year
[00:49:56 - 00:49:59] as well to contribute to
[00:49:59 - 00:50:04] addressing deferred maintenance needs um
[00:50:04 - 00:50:08] so this is the result
[00:50:08 - 00:50:08] of what we expect for
[00:50:08 - 00:50:18] for so looking forward towards
[00:50:18 - 00:50:21] next year's budget development this
[00:50:21 - 00:50:24] is a strategic plan for
[00:50:24 - 00:50:24] that so as a review
[00:50:24 - 00:50:27] planning for revenues the appropriation
[00:50:27 - 00:50:29] that we're going to talk
[00:50:29 - 00:50:29] about is a result of
[00:50:33 - 00:50:33] the 89th legislative session which
[00:50:33 - 00:50:36] i think is been extended
[00:50:36 - 00:50:40] dr sata and so uh
[00:50:40 - 00:50:40] a result also of the
[00:50:40 - 00:50:42] 88th legislature where the house
[00:50:42 - 00:50:46] bill historic house bill 8
[00:50:46 - 00:50:49] uh was greatly impacted and
[00:50:49 - 00:50:49] so our revenues for the
[00:50:51 - 00:50:51] appropriation have changed greatly they
[00:50:54 - 00:50:54] are based upon performance measures
[00:50:54 - 00:50:57] and the payment methods that
[00:50:57 - 00:50:59] uh they have implemented are
[00:50:59 - 00:51:01] different from the past in
[00:51:01 - 00:51:01] the past we'd be funded
[00:51:01 - 00:51:03] on a bienium basis we
[00:51:03 - 00:51:06] get an appropriation we usually
[00:51:06 - 00:51:06] be good for two years
[00:51:06 - 00:51:09] so now that static model
[00:51:09 - 00:51:09] has changed to a more
[00:51:12 - 00:51:12] dynamic one it's based upon
[00:51:12 - 00:51:15] about 17 different performance measures
[00:51:15 - 00:51:17] and so uh very different
[00:51:17 - 00:51:19] and also the payment system
[00:51:19 - 00:51:22] that they've implemented is different
[00:51:22 - 00:51:24] as well so that is
[00:51:24 - 00:51:27] the model that we're currently
[00:51:27 - 00:51:27] operating under tuition and currently
[00:51:27 - 00:51:28] operating under tuition and fees
[00:51:28 - 00:51:33] fees the tuition and fees
[00:51:33 - 00:51:35] um line item here we've
[00:51:35 - 00:51:35] we've uh reviewed our tuition
[00:51:35 - 00:51:39] and fees estimate and as
[00:51:39 - 00:51:41] i mentioned uh the tuition
[00:51:41 - 00:51:41] and fees from the current
[00:51:41 - 00:51:43] year largely go to predict
[00:51:43 - 00:51:45] what we're going to receive
[00:51:45 - 00:51:45] next year and we budget
[00:51:45 - 00:51:47] that way it's a very
[00:51:47 - 00:51:49] conservative way of budgeting what
[00:51:49 - 00:51:51] you're receiving now and then
[00:51:51 - 00:51:51] you budget that way expect
[00:51:51 - 00:51:55] that in the future so
[00:51:55 - 00:51:55] that is typically what we
[00:51:58 - 00:51:58] do but um what we
[00:51:58 - 00:51:58] also do we keep an
[00:51:58 - 00:52:02] eye on enrollment and as
[00:52:02 - 00:52:02] a result we've been looking
[00:52:05 - 00:52:05] almost every day at our
[00:52:05 - 00:52:07] enrollment numbers for the fall
[00:52:07 - 00:52:10] and that is trending lower
[00:52:10 - 00:52:14] our fall enrollment is showing
[00:52:14 - 00:52:14] some decreases and so we
[00:52:14 - 00:52:16] have to consider the risk
[00:52:16 - 00:52:19] of that into our budgeting
[00:52:19 - 00:52:19] so we have lowered our
[00:52:22 - 00:52:22] expectation for tuition and fees
[00:52:22 - 00:52:27] by 1 1 million as
[00:52:27 - 00:52:27] a result of what we're
[00:52:27 - 00:52:30] seeing for enrollment for this
[00:52:30 - 00:52:32] fall now that does not
[00:52:32 - 00:52:34] mean that that's the ultimate
[00:52:34 - 00:52:34] number we're going to use
[00:52:37 - 00:52:37] because as you know the
[00:52:37 - 00:52:39] budget is presented on august
[00:52:39 - 00:52:42] the 27th to the board
[00:52:42 - 00:52:46] for approval so between now
[00:52:46 - 00:52:46] and august 27th our enrollment
[00:52:46 - 00:52:49] may get better to the
[00:52:49 - 00:52:52] extent where we adjust our
[00:52:52 - 00:52:55] revenue estimates what is our
[00:52:55 - 00:52:58] past uh information show that
[00:52:58 - 00:52:58] it does increase between those
[00:53:01 - 00:53:01] those weeks the the past
[00:53:01 - 00:53:03] information shows that we had
[00:53:03 - 00:53:05] a slight increase at this
[00:53:05 - 00:53:05] point in time and at
[00:53:05 - 00:53:08] this point in time we
[00:53:08 - 00:53:08] have a very small decrease
[00:53:11 - 00:53:11] predicted but at this point
[00:53:11 - 00:53:14] in time last year we
[00:53:14 - 00:53:14] we show that we were
[00:53:14 - 00:53:14] we had a year we
[00:53:14 - 00:53:15] we show that we were
[00:53:15 - 00:53:15] we had a positive positive
[00:53:20 - 00:53:22] uh increase in enrollment so
[00:53:22 - 00:53:22] right now it is not
[00:53:22 - 00:53:25] positive it is showing a
[00:53:25 - 00:53:28] negative number so we consider
[00:53:28 - 00:53:28] that as we develop our
[00:53:28 - 00:53:31] tuition and fees prediction and
[00:53:31 - 00:53:34] we'll continue to do that
[00:53:34 - 00:53:34] all the way up until
[00:53:34 - 00:53:36] we finalize and present a
[00:53:36 - 00:53:39] final budget for you so
[00:53:39 - 00:53:39] it may go up or
[00:53:39 - 00:53:41] if it needs to go
[00:53:41 - 00:53:41] down a little bit it'll
[00:53:41 - 00:53:45] be it'll be decreased as
[00:53:45 - 00:53:45] well the nice thing about
[00:53:46 - 00:53:46] um what the college has
[00:53:46 - 00:53:49] done historically to budget for
[00:53:49 - 00:53:51] this to mitigate that risk
[00:53:51 - 00:53:53] of enrollment declining the college
[00:53:53 - 00:53:59] maintains a bianium reserve that
[00:53:59 - 00:53:59] bianium reserve is meant for
[00:53:59 - 00:54:05] just such a situation we're
[00:54:05 - 00:54:05] currently flat judge we're at
[00:54:08 - 00:54:08] 18810 right now we were
[00:54:08 - 00:54:11] at 18857 last year we've
[00:54:11 - 00:54:14] seen the enrollment process tighten
[00:54:14 - 00:54:14] as we've gotten closer to
[00:54:14 - 00:54:15] fall tighten as we've gotten
[00:54:15 - 00:54:15] closer to fall semester semester
[00:54:16 - 00:54:19] semester in in contradiction with
[00:54:19 - 00:54:19] what we saw in the
[00:54:22 - 00:54:22] spring we saw a very
[00:54:22 - 00:54:24] healthy spring 5 increase in
[00:54:24 - 00:54:24] the spring uh the summer
[00:54:27 - 00:54:27] was very healthy as well
[00:54:27 - 00:54:29] um significant increase this summer
[00:54:29 - 00:54:32] um all of those are
[00:54:32 - 00:54:32] indications that we expect to
[00:54:32 - 00:54:36] see a strong fall um
[00:54:36 - 00:54:36] but it is um weakening
[00:54:39 - 00:54:39] as we get closer so
[00:54:39 - 00:54:41] i asked vice president flores
[00:54:41 - 00:54:43] to adjust the budget accordingly
[00:54:43 - 00:54:43] i didn't want there to
[00:54:43 - 00:54:46] be any surprises and so
[00:54:46 - 00:54:47] it's we're much more conservative
[00:54:47 - 00:54:51] with the budgeting process so
[00:54:51 - 00:54:51] i ask that he um
[00:54:51 - 00:54:53] adjust the budget in particular
[00:54:56 - 00:54:56] accordingly um i if anyone
[00:54:56 - 00:54:59] has specific questions i ask
[00:54:59 - 00:55:00] dr maya for questions i
[00:55:00 - 00:55:02] ask dr maya for dr
[00:55:02 - 00:55:04] dr just real quick you
[00:55:04 - 00:55:06] mentioned something about the the
[00:55:06 - 00:55:10] current session is there any
[00:55:10 - 00:55:10] realistic or expectation or the
[00:55:12 - 00:55:12] current special sessions for budget
[00:55:12 - 00:55:16] or is that really set
[00:55:16 - 00:55:18] the special sessions going to
[00:55:18 - 00:55:18] deal with other things so
[00:55:18 - 00:55:19] the special session it's a
[00:55:19 - 00:55:22] great question mr lots of
[00:55:22 - 00:55:24] different items on special session
[00:55:24 - 00:55:24] which essentially we know that
[00:55:26 - 00:55:26] our many of our legislators
[00:55:26 - 00:55:28] not in austin and so
[00:55:28 - 00:55:28] we'll see what ends up
[00:55:30 - 00:55:30] happening i would imagine the
[00:55:30 - 00:55:32] governor will call a second
[00:55:32 - 00:55:35] special session and potentially more
[00:55:35 - 00:55:35] until um the maps come
[00:55:38 - 00:55:38] to completion there is an
[00:55:38 - 00:55:40] item on the special agenda
[00:55:40 - 00:55:43] that pertains to us specifically
[00:55:43 - 00:55:43] and it is tax rate
[00:55:43 - 00:55:45] um now that won't affect
[00:55:45 - 00:55:46] this current year's budget but
[00:55:46 - 00:55:49] that could affect the college
[00:55:49 - 00:55:51] budget going forward um i
[00:55:51 - 00:55:51] don't know if you have
[00:55:51 - 00:55:53] any judge or any other
[00:55:53 - 00:55:53] member has any other questions
[00:55:56 - 00:55:56] on enrollment um again we're
[00:55:58 - 00:55:58] continuing to run enrollment and
[00:55:58 - 00:56:01] we will run enrollment through
[00:56:01 - 00:56:05] um the first week of
[00:56:05 - 00:56:05] class um we allow some
[00:56:05 - 00:56:07] uh scheduled adjustments and then
[00:56:07 - 00:56:09] obviously dual credit early college
[00:56:09 - 00:56:10] high school will continue to
[00:56:10 - 00:56:13] work with our district partners
[00:56:13 - 00:56:13] um all the way up
[00:56:13 - 00:56:15] until census date and actually
[00:56:15 - 00:56:18] i'd remind the board that
[00:56:18 - 00:56:18] we have um many meers
[00:56:18 - 00:56:21] throughout so even on census
[00:56:21 - 00:56:21] date when we report an
[00:56:22 - 00:56:22] enrollment that's not the final
[00:56:24 - 00:56:28] enrollment because we have that
[00:56:28 - 00:56:28] go out throughout the fall
[00:56:28 - 00:56:32] term sure uh so point
[00:56:32 - 00:56:34] in time as dr mentioned
[00:56:34 - 00:56:34] we're basically flat we're 47
[00:56:38 - 00:56:38] students down from last semester
[00:56:38 - 00:56:42] at the same date uh
[00:56:42 - 00:56:44] classes start august 25th we
[00:56:44 - 00:56:44] have several campaigns going on
[00:56:44 - 00:56:46] right now where we are
[00:56:46 - 00:56:50] reaching out to students who
[00:56:50 - 00:56:50] have uh enrolled uh but
[00:56:53 - 00:56:53] haven't completed their fafsa or
[00:56:53 - 00:56:56] need to complete their fafsa
[00:56:56 - 00:56:59] so we have internal campaigns
[00:56:59 - 00:57:01] going on trellis is one
[00:57:01 - 00:57:01] of our partners as well
[00:57:03 - 00:57:03] they're assisting us with those
[00:57:03 - 00:57:05] students seeking assistance with financial
[00:57:05 - 00:57:08] aid so we continue to
[00:57:08 - 00:57:10] add students also as dr
[00:57:10 - 00:57:10] sata mentioned through dual credit
[00:57:12 - 00:57:12] early college high school enrollment
[00:57:14 - 00:57:14] because we still receive those
[00:57:14 - 00:57:17] rosters from our isd partners
[00:57:17 - 00:57:19] so we are working to
[00:57:19 - 00:57:19] get our enrollment keep our
[00:57:23 - 00:57:23] enrollment up and also uh
[00:57:23 - 00:57:25] wherever we end up today
[00:57:25 - 00:57:28] the really important number is
[00:57:28 - 00:57:28] where we end up at
[00:57:28 - 00:57:31] census date which is september
[00:57:31 - 00:57:31] 10 so we work really
[00:57:31 - 00:57:33] hard to get our students
[00:57:33 - 00:57:35] to get our students enrolled
[00:57:35 - 00:57:38] enrolled and sorry yeah uh
[00:57:38 - 00:57:38] we work hard to get
[00:57:42 - 00:57:42] our students enrolled and paid
[00:57:42 - 00:57:45] uh by the by census
[00:57:45 - 00:57:45] date so we try to
[00:57:45 - 00:57:47] reduce the number of students
[00:57:47 - 00:57:47] that we end up having
[00:57:50 - 00:57:50] to drop for a non-payment
[00:57:54 - 00:57:54] uh so lots of campaigns
[00:57:54 - 00:57:58] going on and uh we
[00:57:58 - 00:57:58] still have extended hours uh
[00:58:03 - 00:58:03] coming up this saturday uh
[00:58:03 - 00:58:07] august 16th 10 00 a
[00:58:07 - 00:58:07] m to 2 00 p
[00:58:07 - 00:58:09] m august 23rd 10 00
[00:58:09 - 00:58:09] a m to 2 00
[00:58:09 - 00:58:09] p m as well as
[00:58:12 - 00:58:12] extended hours the week before
[00:58:12 - 00:58:15] classes start and the first
[00:58:15 - 00:58:18] two days of enrollment as
[00:58:18 - 00:58:20] dr about that mentioned we
[00:58:20 - 00:58:20] still allow students to enroll
[00:58:20 - 00:58:23] as long as a class
[00:58:23 - 00:58:23] hasn't met or via a
[00:58:25 - 00:58:28] petition through a dean have
[00:58:28 - 00:58:28] we done any analysis on
[00:58:28 - 00:58:32] how many students are not
[00:58:32 - 00:58:34] returning or how many we
[00:58:34 - 00:58:34] expected to return but are
[00:58:34 - 00:58:38] not um i can look
[00:58:38 - 00:58:38] at we do see what
[00:58:38 - 00:58:40] our uh continuing student enrollment
[00:58:40 - 00:58:44] looks like so we all
[00:58:44 - 00:58:46] summer long we're looking very
[00:58:46 - 00:58:46] healthy it's been the past
[00:58:47 - 00:58:47] couple of weeks that we've
[00:58:47 - 00:58:49] seen this slowdown and one
[00:58:49 - 00:58:49] of the markers that we
[00:58:52 - 00:58:52] do look at is our
[00:58:52 - 00:58:54] continuing students so that's where
[00:58:54 - 00:58:54] we've seen a little bit
[00:58:57 - 00:58:57] of decline so uh there
[00:58:57 - 00:59:01] are there are captive audience
[00:59:01 - 00:59:03] so we're reaching out to
[00:59:03 - 00:59:03] those students as well if
[00:59:03 - 00:59:03] they to those students as
[00:59:04 - 00:59:04] well if they enrolled enrolled
[00:59:07 - 00:59:07] haven't graduated enrolled in spring
[00:59:07 - 00:59:09] or summer and not enrolled
[00:59:09 - 00:59:27] in fall we're so we're
[00:59:27 - 00:59:27] going to continue looking at
[00:59:29 - 00:59:29] tuition and fees and adjust
[00:59:29 - 00:59:32] accordingly up until we present
[00:59:32 - 00:59:34] you a final budget on
[00:59:34 - 00:59:37] august the 27th the next
[00:59:37 - 00:59:38] item are property taxes this
[00:59:40 - 00:59:40] is a number that has
[00:59:40 - 00:59:43] been finalized in the budget
[00:59:43 - 00:59:43] on july the 25th we
[00:59:43 - 00:59:49] received the certified valuations uh
[00:59:49 - 00:59:49] from the cad and our
[00:59:49 - 00:59:52] valuations went up about 4
[00:59:52 - 00:59:55] 6 billion to 73 46
[00:59:55 - 00:59:57] to 73 46 billion billion
[01:00:00 - 01:00:00] uh and also we had
[01:00:00 - 01:00:03] new property valued at 1
[01:00:03 - 01:00:06] 5 billion and resulting in
[01:00:06 - 01:00:06] a no new revenue rate
[01:00:09 - 01:00:12] of 10 3563 cents per
[01:00:12 - 01:00:12] 100 valuation that is down
[01:00:14 - 01:00:17] from 10 77 almost half
[01:00:17 - 01:00:17] a penny down so that
[01:00:17 - 01:00:21] is driving our ability uh
[01:00:21 - 01:00:22] to raise tax revenue should
[01:00:22 - 01:00:26] the college ever need that
[01:00:26 - 01:00:26] uh as a reminder we
[01:00:26 - 01:00:29] are capped at 15 cents
[01:00:29 - 01:00:29] per 100 valuation so anything
[01:00:33 - 01:00:33] driving our rate lower is
[01:00:33 - 01:00:37] uh good for the future
[01:00:37 - 01:00:39] should it be needed now
[01:00:39 - 01:00:42] planning for additional funding request
[01:00:42 - 01:00:42] um today one of the
[01:00:42 - 01:00:45] items on the agenda is
[01:00:45 - 01:00:48] consideration of a salary increase
[01:00:48 - 01:00:52] so the presentation before that
[01:00:52 - 01:00:52] on the budget uh is
[01:00:52 - 01:00:55] to inform what the capacity
[01:00:55 - 01:00:55] is for the district to
[01:00:55 - 01:00:59] fund a salary increase and
[01:00:59 - 01:01:01] also additional funding requests that
[01:01:01 - 01:01:03] have been presented by the
[01:01:03 - 01:01:04] executive levels that you're going
[01:01:04 - 01:01:04] to see in just a
[01:01:04 - 01:01:07] little bit at this point
[01:01:07 - 01:01:07] in time uh what has
[01:01:10 - 01:01:10] changed from june the 25th
[01:01:10 - 01:01:13] is that dr zata has
[01:01:13 - 01:01:13] had a chance to vet
[01:01:13 - 01:01:16] the additional request and uh
[01:01:16 - 01:01:20] dropped them by close to
[01:01:20 - 01:01:20] half a million dollars so
[01:01:23 - 01:01:23] it is a significant decrease
[01:01:26 - 01:01:26] and so um there is
[01:01:26 - 01:01:30] going to be continued impact
[01:01:30 - 01:01:30] from the gazsby 68 and
[01:01:30 - 01:01:33] 75 on unrestricted net position
[01:01:33 - 01:01:35] that is a very variable
[01:01:35 - 01:01:35] amount we depend on the
[01:01:37 - 01:01:37] information from the state which
[01:01:37 - 01:01:39] we do not have yet
[01:01:39 - 01:01:41] but still it's something that
[01:01:41 - 01:01:41] needs to be considered it
[01:01:41 - 01:01:44] averages about 4 million impact
[01:01:44 - 01:01:47] to our fund balance every
[01:01:47 - 01:01:47] year and so an additional
[01:01:50 - 01:01:50] gazsby that u anna and
[01:01:50 - 01:01:53] her team are working on
[01:01:53 - 01:01:53] in accounting is gazsby 101
[01:01:56 - 01:01:56] compensated absences these are things
[01:01:58 - 01:01:58] that we are mandated to
[01:01:58 - 01:02:00] follow by the governmental accounting
[01:02:00 - 01:02:02] standards board otherwise we would
[01:02:02 - 01:02:05] get an unmodifi we would
[01:02:05 - 01:02:05] not get an unmodified opinion
[01:02:05 - 01:02:07] and the uh financial statements
[01:02:07 - 01:02:10] that the college produces are
[01:02:10 - 01:02:13] super important to receive the
[01:02:13 - 01:02:13] appropriation to get pel and
[01:02:16 - 01:02:16] are viewed by many granting
[01:02:16 - 01:02:19] agencies so a very important
[01:02:19 - 01:02:19] document to the a very
[01:02:20 - 01:02:22] important document to the district
[01:02:24 - 01:02:24] so looking at our uh
[01:02:24 - 01:02:26] performance tier this is our
[01:02:26 - 01:02:29] appropriation this is not changed
[01:02:29 - 01:02:30] from the june 25th presentation
[01:02:33 - 01:02:33] um uh looking at the
[01:02:33 - 01:02:34] terminology near final this is
[01:02:34 - 01:02:38] a terminology from the coordinating
[01:02:38 - 01:02:38] board so that implies that
[01:02:40 - 01:02:40] there might be some changes
[01:02:40 - 01:02:42] to that so but that's
[01:02:42 - 01:02:42] the best number that we
[01:02:42 - 01:02:45] have for our appropriation i
[01:02:45 - 01:02:48] will tell you that that
[01:02:48 - 01:02:48] 43 9 million is a
[01:02:48 - 01:02:51] projection by the coordinating board
[01:02:51 - 01:02:54] on what we're going to
[01:02:54 - 01:02:54] earn as appropriation once we
[01:02:57 - 01:02:57] report our actual enrollment numbers
[01:02:57 - 01:03:00] to the coordinating board it
[01:03:00 - 01:03:02] will be different from that
[01:03:02 - 01:03:04] but we don't know by
[01:03:04 - 01:03:07] how much so uh that
[01:03:07 - 01:03:08] number will change either a
[01:03:09 - 01:03:09] little bit or a lot
[01:03:09 - 01:03:11] we don't know at this
[01:03:11 - 01:03:11] point it's the best number
[01:03:11 - 01:03:14] that we have so far
[01:03:16 - 01:03:16] and so that's the cr
[01:03:16 - 01:03:19] some of the criteria that
[01:03:19 - 01:03:19] now go into the criteria
[01:03:20 - 01:03:21] that now go into the
[01:03:21 - 01:03:24] appropriation appropriation uh that is
[01:03:24 - 01:03:26] very different from the bienium
[01:03:26 - 01:03:26] funding that we used to
[01:03:26 - 01:03:35] receive so house bill 8
[01:03:35 - 01:03:35] also changed the way we
[01:03:38 - 01:03:41] receive that particular appropriation and
[01:03:41 - 01:03:41] any future appropriations in coming
[01:03:46 - 01:03:46] years so we just have
[01:03:46 - 01:03:46] to um uh be aware
[01:03:48 - 01:03:48] of how the funding for
[01:03:48 - 01:03:50] appropriation comes in it comes
[01:03:50 - 01:03:52] in in three installments now
[01:03:52 - 01:03:54] which is different from the
[01:03:54 - 01:03:54] past used to come in
[01:03:54 - 01:03:57] in 10 installments uh so
[01:03:57 - 01:03:59] the the state has changed
[01:03:59 - 01:04:02] not only the performance measures
[01:04:02 - 01:04:02] but how they distribute the
[01:04:11 - 01:04:11] other state funding the financial
[01:04:11 - 01:04:15] aid for swift transfer fast
[01:04:19 - 01:04:19] is budgeted at 5 6
[01:04:19 - 01:04:21] million so that has gone
[01:04:21 - 01:04:24] up 175 000 from the
[01:04:24 - 01:04:24] presentation on june the 25th
[01:04:26 - 01:04:26] the reason that that has
[01:04:26 - 01:04:29] gone up is because now
[01:04:29 - 01:04:29] we have received the uh
[01:04:33 - 01:04:33] allocation for the fall of
[01:04:33 - 01:04:36] 2024 we know what that
[01:04:36 - 01:04:36] amount is and then also
[01:04:36 - 01:04:38] we num we know what
[01:04:38 - 01:04:40] the numbers that were reported
[01:04:40 - 01:04:40] for the spring so since
[01:04:40 - 01:04:43] miss zuma had that information
[01:04:43 - 01:04:46] she was up to able
[01:04:46 - 01:04:46] to update her revenue projection
[01:04:50 - 01:04:50] for the fast also um
[01:04:50 - 01:04:53] keep in mind that the
[01:04:53 - 01:04:53] state increased the funding from
[01:04:53 - 01:04:53] the state increased the funding
[01:04:54 - 01:04:54] from 56 87 56 87
[01:04:57 - 01:04:57] cents per per semester credit
[01:04:57 - 01:04:58] hour to cents per per
[01:04:58 - 01:04:59] semester credit hour to 58
[01:04:59 - 01:05:03] 52 58 52 cents per
[01:05:03 - 01:05:06] semester credit hour as far
[01:05:06 - 01:05:06] as benefits are concerned um
[01:05:06 - 01:05:09] for the first time in
[01:05:09 - 01:05:12] several years the state has
[01:05:12 - 01:05:12] raised uh the premium rates
[01:05:13 - 01:05:13] for health insurance they raised
[01:05:13 - 01:05:20] them by 8 and so
[01:05:20 - 01:05:20] um the state currently funds
[01:05:20 - 01:05:23] our health insurance at about
[01:05:23 - 01:05:25] close to 50 they don't
[01:05:25 - 01:05:28] provise funding for physical plant
[01:05:28 - 01:05:28] personnel however we have to
[01:05:31 - 01:05:31] budget for that and the
[01:05:31 - 01:05:33] grants uh pay for their
[01:05:33 - 01:05:37] own health insurance benefits however
[01:05:37 - 01:05:37] um due to the 8
[01:05:37 - 01:05:40] increase uh that is going
[01:05:40 - 01:05:40] to result in a must
[01:05:40 - 01:05:42] be funded or critical item
[01:05:42 - 01:05:44] that you're going to see
[01:05:44 - 01:05:47] on the additional funding request
[01:05:47 - 01:05:48] of 74 000 you're going
[01:05:48 - 01:05:48] to see in a little
[01:05:48 - 01:05:51] while the reason is the
[01:05:51 - 01:05:56] state increased our rate by
[01:05:56 - 01:05:56] 8 we incur close to
[01:05:56 - 01:06:00] 7 7 million of um
[01:06:00 - 01:06:03] health insurance costs that we
[01:06:03 - 01:06:03] fund and so uh you
[01:06:03 - 01:06:06] can do the extension on
[01:06:06 - 01:06:06] that uh there's no change
[01:06:17 - 01:06:17] so just as a reminder
[01:06:17 - 01:06:19] last presentation we talked about
[01:06:19 - 01:06:23] the change in the purchasing
[01:06:23 - 01:06:26] uh mandatory bidding requirement from
[01:06:26 - 01:06:29] 50 to 100 000 and
[01:06:29 - 01:06:29] uh the board discussed this
[01:06:33 - 01:06:33] particular item and uh agreed
[01:06:33 - 01:06:35] that for the next coming
[01:06:35 - 01:06:39] fiscal year the board would
[01:06:39 - 01:06:39] also like to see uh
[01:06:39 - 01:06:40] competitive processes that are done
[01:06:40 - 01:06:43] for anything valued at 100
[01:06:43 - 01:06:43] 000 or more the college
[01:06:46 - 01:06:46] is working to update its
[01:06:46 - 01:06:48] uh procedures or purchasing procedures
[01:06:48 - 01:06:50] with regard to this and
[01:06:50 - 01:06:50] you'll see that in the
[01:06:50 - 01:06:51] august this and you'll see
[01:06:51 - 01:06:53] that in the august 27th
[01:06:56 - 01:06:56] board meeting so now we
[01:06:56 - 01:06:59] look at the projection for
[01:06:59 - 01:07:02] revenues for 2526 so as
[01:07:02 - 01:07:02] i mentioned the current year
[01:07:02 - 01:07:04] is the basis for projections
[01:07:04 - 01:07:07] going into the future and
[01:07:07 - 01:07:07] largely that's what this future
[01:07:07 - 01:07:08] and largely that's what this
[01:07:09 - 01:07:12] represents represents uh on the
[01:07:12 - 01:07:15] state appropriations line we show
[01:07:15 - 01:07:18] an uh increase to the
[01:07:18 - 01:07:22] appropriation compared to the current
[01:07:22 - 01:07:22] year um that is a
[01:07:22 - 01:07:24] result of the college performing
[01:07:24 - 01:07:27] better on its performing on
[01:07:27 - 01:07:30] its performance measures that were
[01:07:30 - 01:07:30] reported last year last year
[01:07:33 - 01:07:33] uh the college received a
[01:07:33 - 01:07:35] 4 7 million dynamic adjustment
[01:07:38 - 01:07:38] over what the coordinated board
[01:07:38 - 01:07:40] had predicted for us that
[01:07:40 - 01:07:43] was a very positive result
[01:07:43 - 01:07:46] for the year this appropriation
[01:07:46 - 01:07:49] increase largely reflects that and
[01:07:49 - 01:07:49] also the increase in the
[01:07:49 - 01:07:53] fast funding rate from 56
[01:07:53 - 01:07:56] to 58 per semester credit
[01:07:56 - 01:07:59] hours um overhead recovery we
[01:07:59 - 01:08:02] predict a small decrease of
[01:08:02 - 01:08:05] 84 000 there um on
[01:08:05 - 01:08:09] the local funds tuition and
[01:08:09 - 01:08:09] fees we have a small
[01:08:09 - 01:08:12] decrease predicted there we are
[01:08:12 - 01:08:14] continuing to look at this
[01:08:14 - 01:08:14] item this is item we
[01:08:16 - 01:08:16] talked about we're looking at
[01:08:16 - 01:08:18] the fall enrollment and we
[01:08:18 - 01:08:19] will adjust accordingly leading up
[01:08:19 - 01:08:22] to the final budget presentation
[01:08:22 - 01:08:24] either up or down we're
[01:08:24 - 01:08:24] going to adjust it the
[01:08:24 - 01:08:27] idea is to produce a
[01:08:27 - 01:08:27] sustainable budget and that is
[01:08:29 - 01:08:34] our key objective um and
[01:08:34 - 01:08:34] so property tax property taxes
[01:08:35 - 01:08:35] now that we have the
[01:08:35 - 01:08:38] certified valuations and the no
[01:08:38 - 01:08:42] new revenue rate we predict
[01:08:42 - 01:08:42] that we're going to receive
[01:08:46 - 01:08:46] at least 75 2 million
[01:08:46 - 01:08:49] in property tax revenue uh
[01:08:49 - 01:08:49] the property tax revenues we
[01:08:51 - 01:08:55] budget very conservative conservatively for
[01:08:55 - 01:08:55] those uh the big the
[01:08:55 - 01:08:58] big thing on that is
[01:08:58 - 01:08:58] that the certified values that
[01:09:01 - 01:09:01] the cad provides the taxing
[01:09:01 - 01:09:05] entities are discounted about 2
[01:09:05 - 01:09:06] 8 so when the college
[01:09:06 - 01:09:09] receives those values they're lower
[01:09:09 - 01:09:12] by 2 8 because they
[01:09:12 - 01:09:12] are they are predicting what
[01:09:16 - 01:09:16] refunds and lawsuits may result
[01:09:16 - 01:09:19] in so the the government
[01:09:19 - 01:09:20] agencies like that because it
[01:09:20 - 01:09:23] results in a more conservative
[01:09:23 - 01:09:23] budget just in case you
[01:09:25 - 01:09:25] have a large refund or
[01:09:25 - 01:09:28] a large lawsuit that may
[01:09:28 - 01:09:28] happen so our property tax
[01:09:31 - 01:09:31] revenue is based upon a
[01:09:31 - 01:09:34] certified rate 2 8 lower
[01:09:34 - 01:09:37] however when uh property tax
[01:09:37 - 01:09:37] owners are mailed their statements
[01:09:41 - 01:09:41] those do not contain that
[01:09:41 - 01:09:44] discount so generally we receive
[01:09:44 - 01:09:47] more revenue than what we
[01:09:47 - 01:09:47] budget because the cad is
[01:09:50 - 01:09:50] very good at resolving those
[01:09:50 - 01:09:54] protests um and so the
[01:09:54 - 01:09:54] the cad the the city
[01:09:57 - 01:09:57] collects uh 100 of the
[01:09:57 - 01:09:59] valuation that they mailed out
[01:09:59 - 01:10:01] but we budget conservatively and
[01:10:01 - 01:10:12] in doing so we're major
[01:10:12 - 01:10:12] other income we continue to
[01:10:14 - 01:10:17] budget interest income very conservatively
[01:10:17 - 01:10:19] at 5 million um as
[01:10:19 - 01:10:20] i said interest income is
[01:10:21 - 01:10:21] something that's unpredictable and not
[01:10:23 - 01:10:23] something that's sustainable so we
[01:10:26 - 01:10:26] don't build up our budget
[01:10:26 - 01:10:29] on that we feel 5
[01:10:29 - 01:10:29] million is very achievable even
[01:10:32 - 01:10:32] if the fed cut rates
[01:10:32 - 01:10:34] uh by more than half
[01:10:34 - 01:10:34] we would still be able
[01:10:34 - 01:10:37] to support our budget and
[01:10:37 - 01:10:40] the future does not predict
[01:10:40 - 01:10:40] that kind of uh decline
[01:10:40 - 01:10:43] in rates so we feel
[01:10:43 - 01:10:46] confident about what we budgeted
[01:10:46 - 01:10:52] for so we we see
[01:10:52 - 01:10:52] um overall the take the
[01:10:56 - 01:10:56] takeaway here is this 173
[01:10:56 - 01:10:59] 9 million is our total
[01:10:59 - 01:11:02] projected revenues uh for next
[01:11:02 - 01:11:02] year we cannot exceed that
[01:11:06 - 01:11:06] as we develop a budget
[01:11:06 - 01:11:09] so that's our uh line
[01:11:09 - 01:11:09] in the sand uh it's
[01:11:09 - 01:11:14] an increase of of 7
[01:11:14 - 01:11:14] 4 4 million over budgeted
[01:11:14 - 01:11:25] revenues so how do those
[01:11:25 - 01:11:27] budgeted revenues what do how
[01:11:27 - 01:11:27] do they look like in
[01:11:27 - 01:11:30] terms of source of funding
[01:11:30 - 01:11:32] property taxes continue to be
[01:11:32 - 01:11:35] the largest revenue source at
[01:11:35 - 01:11:37] 43 27 75 2 2
[01:11:37 - 01:11:41] million followed by appropriations almost
[01:11:41 - 01:11:45] 50 million tuition and fees
[01:11:45 - 01:11:45] those are the three uh
[01:11:45 - 01:11:47] largest revenue sources and then
[01:11:47 - 01:11:50] we have other income self-supporting
[01:11:50 - 01:11:52] and overhead recovery so this
[01:11:52 - 01:11:56] is showing the previous slide
[01:11:56 - 01:11:59] uh by percentage of revenue
[01:11:59 - 01:12:02] source and so we get
[01:12:02 - 01:12:04] to the baseline budget this
[01:12:04 - 01:12:04] is a result of all
[01:12:04 - 01:12:07] the budget submissions by the
[01:12:07 - 01:12:09] executive levels all the vice
[01:12:09 - 01:12:11] presidents and associate vice presidents
[01:12:11 - 01:12:11] so the budget office works
[01:12:13 - 01:12:13] to compile all of these
[01:12:13 - 01:12:17] budgets review them and so
[01:12:17 - 01:12:19] those budget submissions also uh
[01:12:19 - 01:12:21] include additional requests that we're
[01:12:21 - 01:12:21] going to talk about in
[01:12:21 - 01:12:23] a little bit but this
[01:12:23 - 01:12:26] is the baseline budget this
[01:12:26 - 01:12:26] is nothing above what they
[01:12:26 - 01:12:31] had the year before so
[01:12:31 - 01:12:31] u the baseline budget shows
[01:12:31 - 01:12:35] a decrease of uh 1
[01:12:35 - 01:12:37] million that reflects the movement
[01:12:37 - 01:12:40] of positions people leaving the
[01:12:40 - 01:12:40] college at a high salary
[01:12:40 - 01:12:42] and then the recruit the
[01:12:42 - 01:12:46] people recruited coming in at
[01:12:46 - 01:12:46] a lower salary so that
[01:12:46 - 01:12:49] largely is the result of
[01:12:49 - 01:12:49] that so you see a
[01:12:52 - 01:12:52] decrease in the baseline budget
[01:12:52 - 01:12:56] from 2425 to 2526 which
[01:12:56 - 01:12:56] is the middle column 2425
[01:12:56 - 01:12:57] to 2526 which is the
[01:12:57 - 01:13:04] middle column continue continue and
[01:13:04 - 01:13:04] so the other section in
[01:13:04 - 01:13:07] here is the self-supporting area
[01:13:07 - 01:13:10] and they always budget or
[01:13:10 - 01:13:10] break even they cannot exceed
[01:13:12 - 01:13:12] what they have budgeted for
[01:13:12 - 01:13:15] so that is budgeted at
[01:13:15 - 01:13:15] break even no effect on
[01:13:16 - 01:13:19] the baseline budget so then
[01:13:19 - 01:13:20] this baseline baseline budget so
[01:13:20 - 01:13:25] then this baseline budget reflected
[01:13:25 - 01:13:25] by functional area would be
[01:13:29 - 01:13:29] distributed like this uh so
[01:13:29 - 01:13:32] dr smith is still in
[01:13:32 - 01:13:32] the lead here is still
[01:13:32 - 01:13:33] in the lead here million
[01:13:33 - 01:13:38] million uh 33 11 of
[01:13:38 - 01:13:38] the budget and then uh
[01:13:38 - 01:13:40] he's followed by institutional support
[01:13:40 - 01:13:44] at almost 50 million 30
[01:13:44 - 01:13:48] academic support which also belongs
[01:13:48 - 01:13:48] to dr center uh 20
[01:13:48 - 01:13:55] 3 million 12 28 and
[01:13:55 - 01:13:57] operations and and maintenance physical
[01:13:57 - 01:14:00] plant 13 million student services
[01:14:00 - 01:14:04] 12 7 transfers 3 5
[01:14:07 - 01:14:07] public service 3 8 self
[01:14:07 - 01:14:09] 23 and research at 214
[01:14:09 - 01:14:13] 000 so this is the
[01:14:13 - 01:14:17] way that the baseline budget
[01:14:17 - 01:14:17] is allocated by functional area
[01:14:19 - 01:14:19] so you see the same
[01:14:19 - 01:14:22] baseline budget distributed by expense
[01:14:22 - 01:14:26] category so in here uh
[01:14:26 - 01:14:26] the largest category is uh
[01:14:29 - 01:14:29] faculty salaries at 34 13
[01:14:31 - 01:14:31] and then you can see
[01:14:31 - 01:14:33] in the block here how
[01:14:33 - 01:14:33] that details out between full-time
[01:14:36 - 01:14:36] and part-time faculty and then
[01:14:36 - 01:14:39] over here staff salaries close
[01:14:39 - 01:14:41] to 50 million you see
[01:14:41 - 01:14:41] the detail between full-time and
[01:14:44 - 01:14:44] part-time over here and overtime
[01:14:44 - 01:14:47] and then followed by supplies
[01:14:47 - 01:14:51] and services 28 million 17
[01:14:51 - 01:14:51] of the budget benefits 14
[01:14:56 - 01:14:56] million transfer 7 5 contingency
[01:14:56 - 01:15:01] 6 5 travel 1 3
[01:15:01 - 01:15:06] equipment 1 1 so this
[01:15:06 - 01:15:06] is how the expenses break
[01:15:06 - 01:15:08] out um for the baseline
[01:15:08 - 01:15:11] budget the interesting thing here
[01:15:11 - 01:15:13] if you add faculty salaries
[01:15:13 - 01:15:15] staff salaries and benefits you
[01:15:15 - 01:15:15] get close to 73 of
[01:15:16 - 01:15:18] the benefits you get close
[01:15:19 - 01:15:22] to 73 of the budget
[01:15:25 - 01:15:25] i real quick some time
[01:15:25 - 01:15:27] ago there was a question
[01:15:27 - 01:15:29] about having enough part-time to
[01:15:29 - 01:15:29] split between part-time and full-time
[01:15:32 - 01:15:32] faculty and i think is
[01:15:32 - 01:15:34] there any question about do
[01:15:34 - 01:15:34] we have to look at
[01:15:39 - 01:15:39] those kinds of t uh
[01:15:39 - 01:15:42] sachs evaluations are we still
[01:15:42 - 01:15:42] okay there we we are
[01:15:42 - 01:15:44] to date mr xer so
[01:15:44 - 01:15:49] what mr person is referencing
[01:15:49 - 01:15:49] is um gosh um 12
[01:15:49 - 01:15:51] years ago um we had
[01:15:51 - 01:15:51] a sax on-site visit our
[01:15:54 - 01:15:54] accrediting agency sax coc now
[01:15:54 - 01:15:56] um southern association of colleges
[01:15:56 - 01:15:58] and schools commission on colleges
[01:15:58 - 01:16:01] did a visit and they
[01:16:01 - 01:16:03] broke down our our faculty
[01:16:03 - 01:16:03] ratios in a different manner
[01:16:05 - 01:16:05] than they had ever done
[01:16:05 - 01:16:08] before we're one accreditation one
[01:16:08 - 01:16:11] college five campuses six sites
[01:16:11 - 01:16:13] total and what they did
[01:16:13 - 01:16:13] and this is more in
[01:16:13 - 01:16:15] particular for you is they
[01:16:15 - 01:16:15] came in and they said
[01:16:15 - 01:16:17] they looked at every single
[01:16:17 - 01:16:19] program on every single campus
[01:16:19 - 01:16:19] and deemed that we had
[01:16:19 - 01:16:22] to have full-time faculty at
[01:16:22 - 01:16:26] each of those programs and
[01:16:26 - 01:16:26] um and campuses um that
[01:16:28 - 01:16:28] caused the institution we were
[01:16:28 - 01:16:32] put on warning uh we
[01:16:32 - 01:16:32] had to raise taxes and
[01:16:35 - 01:16:35] hire 55 additional full-time faculty
[01:16:37 - 01:16:37] over the course of the
[01:16:37 - 01:16:39] year um prior to that
[01:16:39 - 01:16:39] they looked at us as
[01:16:39 - 01:16:43] a district and we covered
[01:16:43 - 01:16:45] between 47 and 52 full-time
[01:16:45 - 01:16:45] faculty in any one of
[01:16:45 - 01:16:47] those given terms during that
[01:16:47 - 01:16:50] the the five years preceding
[01:16:50 - 01:16:50] when they came we were
[01:16:53 - 01:16:53] just under 48 we turn
[01:16:53 - 01:16:55] around we hired those full-time
[01:16:55 - 01:16:56] faculty dr smith and his
[01:16:56 - 01:16:56] team did a tremendous job
[01:16:56 - 01:16:59] of hiring again 55 additional
[01:16:59 - 01:17:01] full-time faculty uh we were
[01:17:01 - 01:17:04] taken off morning the following
[01:17:04 - 01:17:04] summer uh and at one
[01:17:04 - 01:17:07] point i i believe that
[01:17:07 - 01:17:07] we had um 72 of
[01:17:07 - 01:17:10] our sections taught by full-time
[01:17:10 - 01:17:12] faculty despite the ratio so
[01:17:12 - 01:17:14] you see that the full-time
[01:17:14 - 01:17:14] faculty salaries are just over
[01:17:16 - 01:17:16] the part-time faculty but our
[01:17:16 - 01:17:19] full-time faculty teaches the bulk
[01:17:19 - 01:17:21] of the courses at the
[01:17:21 - 01:17:21] institution i don't recall where
[01:17:24 - 01:17:27] we are currently the last
[01:17:27 - 01:17:27] time i saw was 72
[01:17:27 - 01:17:28] i'm not sure where we
[01:17:28 - 01:17:32] are now yeah i think
[01:17:32 - 01:17:32] we're down around uh 68
[01:17:35 - 01:17:35] uh currently uh every position
[01:17:35 - 01:17:37] that becomes available or is
[01:17:37 - 01:17:40] requested for faculty uh gets
[01:17:40 - 01:17:43] discussed at leadership um our
[01:17:43 - 01:17:43] instructional deans and eps uh
[01:17:45 - 01:17:45] talked about every single position
[01:17:45 - 01:17:47] we look at the ratios
[01:17:47 - 01:17:49] that uh are being referred
[01:17:49 - 01:17:49] to across the district before
[01:17:53 - 01:17:53] we make a determination on
[01:17:53 - 01:17:56] the point we don't have
[01:17:56 - 01:17:56] any we're not concerned about
[01:17:58 - 01:17:58] that's a great great question
[01:17:58 - 01:18:00] structure bringing me back to
[01:18:00 - 01:18:02] the actual question we just
[01:18:02 - 01:18:02] had an accrediting site visit
[01:18:05 - 01:18:05] um we were in 23
[01:18:05 - 01:18:08] uh this was not anything
[01:18:08 - 01:18:08] that came up with um
[01:18:08 - 01:18:11] uh with the site visit
[01:18:11 - 01:18:11] or the offsite visit we
[01:18:14 - 01:18:14] were found in compliance with
[01:18:14 - 01:18:16] the ratio fulltime so you
[01:18:16 - 01:18:18] don't you don't worry about
[01:18:18 - 01:18:18] it the next time is
[01:18:18 - 01:18:20] in 2028 um where it'll
[01:18:20 - 01:18:20] come up and they'll look
[01:18:20 - 01:18:21] at that closely and we
[01:18:21 - 01:18:34] want to make sure so
[01:18:34 - 01:18:34] this is a look at
[01:18:34 - 01:18:37] what the additional funding requests
[01:18:37 - 01:18:40] for 2526 are under the
[01:18:40 - 01:18:43] critical needs uh overall there's
[01:18:43 - 01:18:43] a request for 1 7
[01:18:47 - 01:18:47] million what changed from the
[01:18:47 - 01:18:50] june 25th presentation is we
[01:18:50 - 01:18:54] had initially submitted a request
[01:18:54 - 01:18:56] for 264 000 in increase
[01:18:56 - 01:18:59] in insurance premiums well now
[01:18:59 - 01:18:59] the insurance carriers have provided
[01:19:01 - 01:19:01] uh what they're going to
[01:19:01 - 01:19:03] what they're going to ask
[01:19:03 - 01:19:03] for for insurance so we
[01:19:06 - 01:19:06] lowered that to what the
[01:19:06 - 01:19:08] increase is for insurance rates
[01:19:08 - 01:19:10] so that has been lowered
[01:19:10 - 01:19:10] and then as i mentioned
[01:19:10 - 01:19:13] earlier the increase of 8
[01:19:13 - 01:19:16] to the health insurance uh
[01:19:16 - 01:19:19] originally we had estimated 450
[01:19:19 - 01:19:19] 000 we were off on
[01:19:19 - 01:19:23] that we were too low
[01:19:23 - 01:19:23] uh we uh updated our
[01:19:23 - 01:19:25] numbers our projections for health
[01:19:25 - 01:19:31] insurance cost 8 of that
[01:19:31 - 01:19:31] cost has resulted in 74
[01:19:31 - 01:19:35] 000 that we need for
[01:19:35 - 01:19:37] health insurance the other must
[01:19:37 - 01:19:37] be funded items have not
[01:19:40 - 01:19:40] changed from the last presentation
[01:19:43 - 01:19:43] under the other funding requests
[01:19:43 - 01:19:46] from executive levels uh that
[01:19:46 - 01:19:50] is decreased from uh 2
[01:19:50 - 01:19:53] 4 million down to 1
[01:19:53 - 01:19:55] 956 a decrease of about
[01:19:55 - 01:19:59] 400 000 a little over
[01:19:59 - 01:19:59] 400 000 uh the main
[01:19:59 - 01:20:01] decrease came in the instruction
[01:20:01 - 01:20:05] and workforce education area um
[01:20:05 - 01:20:18] so that's the main so
[01:20:18 - 01:20:18] this slide is a compilation
[01:20:18 - 01:20:20] of the big numbers that
[01:20:20 - 01:20:23] we saw for total projected
[01:20:23 - 01:20:26] revenues the first row shows
[01:20:26 - 01:20:26] the number that we covered
[01:20:26 - 01:20:30] under total projected revenues 173
[01:20:30 - 01:20:33] 9 million so we cannot
[01:20:33 - 01:20:36] exceed that that's going to
[01:20:36 - 01:20:36] be our uh top of
[01:20:36 - 01:20:39] the top of the budget
[01:20:39 - 01:20:43] line and the baseline preliminary
[01:20:43 - 01:20:46] budget is 165 4 million
[01:20:46 - 01:20:46] i'm looking in the no
[01:20:46 - 01:20:50] salary increase column just to
[01:20:50 - 01:20:50] start a review of this
[01:20:53 - 01:20:53] particular slide uh it results
[01:20:53 - 01:20:56] in a budget surplus of
[01:20:56 - 01:20:56] 8 point around 8 5
[01:20:56 - 01:20:57] budget surplus of 8 point
[01:20:57 - 01:20:57] around 8 5 million million
[01:21:00 - 01:21:00] so how is that allocated
[01:21:00 - 01:21:03] well we have must be
[01:21:03 - 01:21:03] funded the increases that are
[01:21:06 - 01:21:06] mandatory that we have to
[01:21:06 - 01:21:09] cover of 1 7 million
[01:21:09 - 01:21:09] and then recall at the
[01:21:09 - 01:21:13] june 25th budget presentation workshop
[01:21:13 - 01:21:15] uh we talked about the
[01:21:15 - 01:21:17] 6 adjustment to the salary
[01:21:17 - 01:21:18] tables where anybody making less
[01:21:20 - 01:21:20] than 10 an hour would
[01:21:20 - 01:21:24] be brought up to 10
[01:21:24 - 01:21:24] that was about 200 000
[01:21:24 - 01:21:27] of this particular line item
[01:21:27 - 01:21:29] request and the difference was
[01:21:29 - 01:21:29] a 6 increase to the
[01:21:32 - 01:21:32] entry levels on the tables
[01:21:32 - 01:21:34] which will allow for recruitment
[01:21:34 - 01:21:38] and retaining staff so uh
[01:21:38 - 01:21:38] that's what that 672 000
[01:21:42 - 01:21:42] is all about in the
[01:21:42 - 01:21:44] no salary increase column it
[01:21:44 - 01:21:48] results in surplus before additional
[01:21:48 - 01:21:48] request of 6 1 million
[01:21:50 - 01:21:50] and so uh we looked
[01:21:50 - 01:21:53] at the additional request of
[01:21:53 - 01:21:53] 1 9 million so if
[01:21:53 - 01:21:55] there was no salary increase
[01:21:55 - 01:21:58] there would be a surplus
[01:21:58 - 01:22:02] of 4 1 million so
[01:22:02 - 01:22:02] the way this slide is
[01:22:02 - 01:22:09] laid out a 1 this
[01:22:09 - 01:22:09] includes uh for the related
[01:22:09 - 01:22:10] this includes uh for the
[01:22:10 - 01:22:14] related benefits benefits for a
[01:22:14 - 01:22:17] salary increase as well so
[01:22:17 - 01:22:17] in the 1 column you
[01:22:17 - 01:22:20] then see when you plug
[01:22:20 - 01:22:20] that number in it results
[01:22:20 - 01:22:23] in a increase in bannual
[01:22:23 - 01:22:23] reserve of 3 1 increase
[01:22:23 - 01:22:24] in bannual reserve of 3
[01:22:24 - 01:22:28] 1 million million so as
[01:22:28 - 01:22:28] you move across the columns
[01:22:28 - 01:22:32] here and look at the
[01:22:32 - 01:22:32] 3 column you see that
[01:22:35 - 01:22:35] the value of a 3
[01:22:35 - 01:22:39] salary increase is a little
[01:22:39 - 01:22:39] over 3 million and results
[01:22:39 - 01:22:41] in an increase to the
[01:22:41 - 01:22:41] bianium reserve of 1 increase
[01:22:42 - 01:22:44] to the bianium reserve of
[01:22:44 - 01:22:48] 1 million if you continue
[01:22:48 - 01:22:48] across a 5 would result
[01:22:52 - 01:22:52] in a uh need to
[01:22:52 - 01:22:53] go into banning reserve a
[01:22:53 - 01:22:53] negative amount of almost a
[01:22:53 - 01:22:54] million a negative amount of
[01:22:54 - 01:22:55] almost a million dollars dollars
[01:22:58 - 01:22:58] what does the fed uh
[01:22:58 - 01:22:59] expect inflation to be this
[01:22:59 - 01:23:01] year the inflation rate right
[01:23:01 - 01:23:05] now is i think about
[01:23:05 - 01:23:09] 2 4 dr somewhere yeah
[01:23:09 - 01:23:09] it rose to 2 7
[01:23:09 - 01:23:09] um 2 7 but um
[01:23:09 - 01:23:11] i think the current ratio
[01:23:11 - 01:23:15] shows it trending down once
[01:23:15 - 01:23:17] again um it's a great
[01:23:17 - 01:23:20] question judge you and economists
[01:23:20 - 01:23:20] will continue to try and
[01:23:22 - 01:23:22] figure that out they do
[01:23:22 - 01:23:25] anticipate that inflation will will
[01:23:25 - 01:23:28] start to get closer to
[01:23:28 - 01:23:28] 2 um at the end
[01:23:28 - 01:23:34] of this year going yes
[01:23:34 - 01:23:36] sir looking at this the
[01:23:36 - 01:23:38] bottom line additional requests going
[01:23:38 - 01:23:40] to the previous page it
[01:23:40 - 01:23:44] said additional funding requests for
[01:23:44 - 01:23:44] 2025 it says critical needs
[01:23:47 - 01:23:47] must be funded 1 7
[01:23:47 - 01:23:50] million and when you said
[01:23:50 - 01:23:50] other funding requests and i
[01:23:50 - 01:23:52] i don't see as must
[01:23:52 - 01:23:57] be requested but the total
[01:23:57 - 01:23:57] of all that is uh
[01:23:57 - 01:24:00] 44 000 less under 2
[01:24:00 - 01:24:00] million but we take all
[01:24:00 - 01:24:03] of that do i take
[01:24:03 - 01:24:03] that to mean that even
[01:24:04 - 01:24:05] though it's not must be
[01:24:05 - 01:24:08] funded we're going to say
[01:24:08 - 01:24:08] we're going to fund all
[01:24:08 - 01:24:10] of those requests at the
[01:24:10 - 01:24:16] requested amount so in other
[01:24:16 - 01:24:16] words that 1 956 million
[01:24:16 - 01:24:18] is is is to accept
[01:24:18 - 01:24:18] it it's my recommendation to
[01:24:26 - 01:24:26] why would it be preliminary
[01:24:26 - 01:24:28] you mean just because whole
[01:24:28 - 01:24:34] budget's preliminary so are there
[01:24:34 - 01:24:37] any other questions relating related
[01:24:37 - 01:24:37] to the funding strategy relating
[01:24:38 - 01:24:44] related to the funding strategy
[01:24:45 - 01:24:47] options so what are the
[01:24:47 - 01:24:49] next steps the next steps
[01:24:49 - 01:24:49] are there's an item today
[01:24:49 - 01:24:51] to approve a salary enhancement

[01:27:04 - 01:27:07] my recommendation to the board

[01:27:07 - 01:27:08] your consideration to look at
[01:27:08 - 01:27:12] a salary enhancement of 3
[01:27:12 - 01:27:14] um that provides again um
[01:27:14 - 01:27:14] a cost of living adjustment
[01:27:14 - 01:27:17] as well as um dealing
[01:27:17 - 01:27:20] with inflation and at the
[01:27:20 - 01:27:20] same time not having a
[01:27:20 - 01:27:23] budget so tight that we're
[01:27:23 - 01:27:26] only seeing um a 48
[01:27:26 - 01:27:26] 000 bianual reserve uh this
[01:27:26 - 01:27:29] would allow us to a
[01:27:29 - 01:27:32] 3 enhancement would allow us
[01:27:32 - 01:27:32] to still maintain approximately a
[01:27:35 - 01:27:35] million dollar biium reserve i'd
[01:27:35 - 01:27:38] remind the board that uh
[01:27:38 - 01:27:42] based on an outcomes um
[01:27:42 - 01:27:42] model the the state appropriations
[01:27:43 - 01:27:44] will change annually we've been
[01:27:46 - 01:27:46] fortunate based on the good
[01:27:46 - 01:27:48] work of um everyone at
[01:27:48 - 01:27:48] the college led by my
[01:27:51 - 01:27:51] colleagues on my left um
[01:27:51 - 01:27:53] that we've been able to
[01:27:53 - 01:27:53] see state appropriations go up
[01:27:55 - 01:27:55] since we implemented this new
[01:27:55 - 01:27:58] funding model in 2023 and
[01:27:58 - 01:28:00] we've gone up annually there
[01:28:00 - 01:28:00] will come a time where
[01:28:03 - 01:28:03] we will see an adjustment
[01:28:03 - 01:28:05] downward based on um things
[01:28:05 - 01:28:05] that the state is putting
[01:28:07 - 01:28:07] in place i remind the
[01:28:07 - 01:28:10] board they're not funding all
[01:28:10 - 01:28:13] associate degrees any longer it
[01:28:13 - 01:28:13] went from 10 years to
[01:28:13 - 01:28:16] 5 years in one bienium
[01:28:16 - 01:28:16] uh we we are losing
[01:28:16 - 01:28:19] um funding for six associates
[01:28:19 - 01:28:20] degrees it doesn't mean we're
[01:28:20 - 01:28:21] going to stop providing those
[01:28:21 - 01:28:23] to students we're going to
[01:28:23 - 01:28:23] try to get them through
[01:28:23 - 01:28:25] faster and get them to
[01:28:25 - 01:28:27] transfer as quickly as possible
[01:28:27 - 01:28:27] uh but it's my recommendation
[01:28:29 - 01:28:29] that the board entertain a
[01:28:29 - 01:28:33] 3 salary enhancement for the
[01:28:33 - 01:28:37] institution okay have a motion
[01:28:37 - 01:28:37] move to approve 3 okay

[01:28:39 - 01:28:42] approve 3 second second any
