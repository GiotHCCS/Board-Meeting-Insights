[00:03:01 - 00:03:01] then co hit and then

[00:03:09 - 00:03:12] colleges throughout the state of
[00:03:12 - 00:03:12] texas as dr tarata said
[00:03:12 - 00:03:14] uh the first audit that
[00:03:14 - 00:03:14] we got to do for
[00:03:14 - 00:03:17] the college this year uh
[00:03:17 - 00:03:17] if we go to the
[00:03:17 - 00:03:25] next slide audit i'll keep
[00:03:25 - 00:03:25] going it'll show up here
[00:03:26 - 00:03:29] in a minute that internal
[00:03:29 - 00:03:29] audit uh as the the
[00:03:32 - 00:03:32] state auditor's office uh inquire
[00:03:32 - 00:03:33] was was sending inquiries through
[00:03:33 - 00:03:35] all the different oh thank
[00:03:35 - 00:03:37] you i didn't realize i
[00:03:37 - 00:03:39] had a pointer the state
[00:03:39 - 00:03:41] auditor office put out inquiries
[00:03:41 - 00:03:41] throughout some a lot of
[00:03:41 - 00:03:42] the community colleges and universities
[00:03:44 - 00:03:44] throughout the state of texas
[00:03:44 - 00:03:46] and essentially asked if they
[00:03:46 - 00:03:50] were going to do the
[00:03:50 - 00:03:50] uh an internal audit of
[00:03:50 - 00:03:52] s sp17 if not i
[00:03:52 - 00:03:52] believe that the the sao
[00:03:52 - 00:03:54] was going in and doing
[00:03:54 - 00:03:54] audits on a selected basis
[00:03:56 - 00:03:56] and so that was our
[00:03:56 - 00:03:59] first audit this year that
[00:03:59 - 00:03:59] internal audit included uh the
[00:04:02 - 00:04:02] compliance with sb17 as codified
[00:04:02 - 00:04:06] within the texas education code
[00:04:06 - 00:04:09] section 51 3525 um through
[00:04:09 - 00:04:11] our procedures uh ultimately you
[00:04:11 - 00:04:11] got a clean report we
[00:04:13 - 00:04:13] found no findings as part
[00:04:13 - 00:04:15] of the report uh so
[00:04:15 - 00:04:15] there was nothing really to
[00:04:15 - 00:04:17] bring you today we did
[00:04:17 - 00:04:19] however have some improvement opportunities
[00:04:19 - 00:04:22] that essentially um included different
[00:04:24 - 00:04:24] documents throughout the the college
[00:04:26 - 00:04:28] throughout the hiring procedures throughout
[00:04:28 - 00:04:30] the onboarding also throughout uh
[00:04:30 - 00:04:33] the website site that essentially
[00:04:33 - 00:04:35] could be enhanced or modified
[00:04:35 - 00:04:35] to be more clearly in
[00:04:37 - 00:04:37] compliance with sp7 there were
[00:04:37 - 00:04:39] a few things that were
[00:04:39 - 00:04:39] kind of in a gray
[00:04:39 - 00:04:40] area and so we brought
[00:04:40 - 00:04:42] those to the attention of
[00:04:42 - 00:04:44] college administration and they addressed
[00:04:44 - 00:04:46] those immediately and so ultimately
[00:04:46 - 00:04:46] uh that was the audit
[00:04:46 - 00:04:48] you got a clean audit
[00:04:48 - 00:04:50] report there were no findings
[00:04:50 - 00:04:52] just some opportunities for improvement
[00:04:52 - 00:04:52] and so i'm very happy
[00:04:52 - 00:04:54] to bring that to you
[00:04:54 - 00:04:57] tonight and let you know
[00:04:57 - 00:04:57] that through our audit um
[00:04:57 - 00:04:59] that again no findings so
[00:04:59 - 00:04:59] uh congratulations again no findings
[00:04:59 - 00:05:00] so uh congratulations to to
[00:05:03 - 00:05:03] uh dr zarata uh and
[00:05:03 - 00:05:05] all the college administration for
[00:05:05 - 00:05:10] administration for that that questions
[00:05:10 - 00:05:10] yes sir yeah i i
[00:05:10 - 00:05:13] i guess i i don't
[00:05:13 - 00:05:13] understand but it all that
[00:05:13 - 00:05:16] goes on i'm not in
[00:05:16 - 00:05:16] human resources but i see
[00:05:21 - 00:05:21] this as sbi 17 signed
[00:05:21 - 00:05:24] into law in 2023 and
[00:05:24 - 00:05:24] if you watch the news
[00:05:24 - 00:05:28] dei has become a a
[00:05:28 - 00:05:28] big subject to look at
[00:05:28 - 00:05:30] and there's a presidential order
[00:05:30 - 00:05:33] that addresses this concept and
[00:05:33 - 00:05:33] i and i say that
[00:05:33 - 00:05:35] only because i'm familiar with
[00:05:35 - 00:05:38] the idea that i heard
[00:05:38 - 00:05:38] the words but how does
[00:05:38 - 00:05:40] this relate to whatever is
[00:05:40 - 00:05:42] going on that's come out
[00:05:42 - 00:05:42] of washington and and whatever
[00:05:46 - 00:05:46] is being proposed what is
[00:05:46 - 00:05:47] s sp7 what is the
[00:05:47 - 00:05:47] current position that we should
[00:05:48 - 00:05:51] be looking at and how
[00:05:51 - 00:05:53] are we responding and do
[00:05:53 - 00:05:53] we have anything we need
[00:05:53 - 00:05:53] to do be do we
[00:05:53 - 00:05:54] have anything we need to
[00:05:54 - 00:05:58] do be concerned concerned about
[00:05:58 - 00:05:58] that's a big question have
[00:05:58 - 00:06:02] at it well as sb
[00:06:02 - 00:06:02] 17 and general counsel i
[00:06:03 - 00:06:03] don't know where they're they're
[00:06:03 - 00:06:04] at but they can correct
[00:06:04 - 00:06:04] me or step in at
[00:06:05 - 00:06:08] any moment um sb7 is
[00:06:08 - 00:06:10] is from the texas senate
[00:06:10 - 00:06:10] and so this is the
[00:06:10 - 00:06:12] texas legislature really doesn't have
[00:06:12 - 00:06:14] anything attached to what's going
[00:06:14 - 00:06:16] on nationally or federally uh
[00:06:16 - 00:06:16] at the moment this this
[00:06:18 - 00:06:18] actually came out before the
[00:06:18 - 00:06:21] the newest federal pronouncements and
[00:06:21 - 00:06:24] s sp17 essentially tells public
[00:06:24 - 00:06:27] colleges and universities that dei
[00:06:27 - 00:06:27] can't be a part of
[00:06:30 - 00:06:33] hiring practices differential treatment can't
[00:06:33 - 00:06:33] be part of any mandatory
[00:06:33 - 00:06:37] training uh it does not
[00:06:37 - 00:06:40] impact curriculum so curriculum is
[00:06:40 - 00:06:40] set aside it also does
[00:06:40 - 00:06:42] not impact what the college
[00:06:42 - 00:06:46] can do to apply for
[00:06:46 - 00:06:46] and demonstrate uh statistics as
[00:06:48 - 00:06:48] part of federal grants or
[00:06:48 - 00:06:48] to to apply part of
[00:06:48 - 00:06:49] federal grants or to to
[00:06:49 - 00:06:51] apply for for for grants
[00:06:51 - 00:06:54] grants um checking to see
[00:06:54 - 00:06:54] a couple other um checking
[00:06:54 - 00:06:55] to see a couple other
[00:06:56 - 00:06:58] things things um no anti-is
[00:06:58 - 00:07:01] it doesn't impact federal anti-is
[00:07:01 - 00:07:01] mination and what goes on
[00:07:01 - 00:07:02] in compliance with federal compliance
[00:07:03 - 00:07:07] with federal anti-discrimination anti-discrimination laws
[00:07:07 - 00:07:07] uh course instruction does not
[00:07:09 - 00:07:09] affect student organizations so there
[00:07:12 - 00:07:12] can be student organizations uh
[00:07:12 - 00:07:15] that have dei concepts associated
[00:07:15 - 00:07:17] with them does not impact
[00:07:17 - 00:07:17] those at all does also
[00:07:20 - 00:07:20] does not impact any guest
[00:07:20 - 00:07:23] speakers or performers uh student
[00:07:23 - 00:07:24] recruitment or performers uh student
[00:07:24 - 00:07:28] recruitment or admissions admissions um
[00:07:28 - 00:07:28] and it it really is
[00:07:28 - 00:07:31] centered around not spending in
[00:07:31 - 00:07:34] money related to those topics
[00:07:34 - 00:07:34] that are state funded so
[00:07:34 - 00:07:36] no no state money can
[00:07:36 - 00:07:36] be spent on that and
[00:07:36 - 00:07:40] so this report is impacted
[00:07:40 - 00:07:43] for what the what texas
[00:07:43 - 00:07:43] came out with prior to
[00:07:43 - 00:07:45] any federal uh any federal
[00:07:45 - 00:07:48] outlay and we haven't seen
[00:07:48 - 00:07:51] any direct impact other than
[00:07:51 - 00:07:51] from a federal standpoint yet
[00:07:51 - 00:07:53] on mandates for the the
[00:07:53 - 00:07:55] shells and shell nots other
[00:07:55 - 00:07:55] than you know things like
[00:07:55 - 00:07:55] the nots other than you
[00:07:55 - 00:07:56] know things like the the
[00:07:56 - 00:07:59] the ncaa uh rules that
[00:07:59 - 00:08:01] are coming out in being
[00:08:01 - 00:08:01] impacted by that but of
[00:08:01 - 00:08:04] course the ncja i'm sure
[00:08:04 - 00:08:08] will will follow suit so
[00:08:08 - 00:08:08] with respect to what our
[00:08:10 - 00:08:10] agreement is with you and
[00:08:10 - 00:08:13] your your organization we you've
[00:08:13 - 00:08:14] completed and and whatever is
[00:08:14 - 00:08:18] going on nationally subse you
[00:08:18 - 00:08:20] know subsequent to to uh
[00:08:20 - 00:08:20] the swearing of a new
[00:08:20 - 00:08:23] president a new administration that
[00:08:23 - 00:08:26] has no bear there's no
[00:08:26 - 00:08:28] reason to revisit anything that
[00:08:28 - 00:08:28] you have in your report
[00:08:28 - 00:08:29] here not yet it's yet
[00:08:30 - 00:08:33] it's as as far there's
[00:08:33 - 00:08:34] been nothing ferally that's been
[00:08:34 - 00:08:34] pushed down that impacts or
[00:08:36 - 00:08:36] anything that we'd have to
[00:08:36 - 00:08:37] revisit but if there did
[00:08:37 - 00:08:37] then we would need to
[00:08:39 - 00:08:39] rewrite our agreement with you
[00:08:39 - 00:08:41] because as far as we're
[00:08:41 - 00:08:44] concerned you have we're we're
[00:08:44 - 00:08:44] complete with this report as
[00:08:44 - 00:08:47] of what it applied to
[00:08:47 - 00:08:47] when when it you know
[00:08:49 - 00:08:49] correct yeah we've completed the
[00:08:49 - 00:08:51] scope and objectives of this
[00:08:51 - 00:08:54] report now as your your
[00:08:54 - 00:08:56] contracted internal auditor we have
[00:08:56 - 00:08:56] a contract i think i
[00:08:56 - 00:08:59] believe for 3 years plus
[00:08:59 - 00:08:59] renewal so we're we're in
[00:08:59 - 00:09:03] the process five years part
[00:09:03 - 00:09:05] of um my clicker went
[00:09:05 - 00:09:05] away if we could go
[00:09:05 - 00:09:09] back to the prior slide
[00:09:09 - 00:09:09] oh that's fine we we
[00:09:09 - 00:09:11] also there we go the
[00:09:11 - 00:09:13] the bottom section there we're
[00:09:13 - 00:09:13] also in the middle well
[00:09:13 - 00:09:15] actually we're at the tail
[00:09:15 - 00:09:17] end of our internal audit
[00:09:17 - 00:09:17] risk assessment and so what
[00:09:17 - 00:09:21] that is is we've performed
[00:09:21 - 00:09:24] u a facilitated entity-wide risk
[00:09:24 - 00:09:27] assessment that covers pretty much
[00:09:27 - 00:09:29] all of the college's operations
[00:09:29 - 00:09:32] and significant activities and we
[00:09:32 - 00:09:32] we went through we had

[00:09:34 - 00:09:36] the president and his cabinet
[00:09:36 - 00:09:39] and walked through those areas

[00:09:51 - 00:09:51] future to you and that
[00:09:51 - 00:09:53] will lay out a multi-year
[00:09:53 - 00:09:57] plan of other audits that
[00:09:57 - 00:09:57] we will do in subsequent
[00:09:57 - 00:10:00] years so we're c covered
[00:10:00 - 00:10:03] with respect to potential activities

[00:19:53 - 00:19:53] thank you to staffer sophia
[00:19:56 - 00:19:56] garcia from senator husman's office
[00:19:56 - 00:19:58] who took the time to
[00:19:58 - 00:19:58] meet with us and talk
[00:19:58 - 00:20:00] a little bit of how
[00:20:00 - 00:20:03] us students can be involved
[00:20:03 - 00:20:05] into the political process one
[00:20:05 - 00:20:05] thing she said that really
[00:20:08 - 00:20:08] stuck with me was that
[00:20:08 - 00:20:11] we as students have the
[00:20:11 - 00:20:14] power to accomplish anything hearing
[00:20:14 - 00:20:16] that from someone who working
[00:20:16 - 00:20:16] directly in the heart of
[00:20:16 - 00:20:18] our state government made me
[00:20:18 - 00:20:20] realize that the only limits
[00:20:20 - 00:20:20] we face are the ones
[00:20:20 - 00:20:23] we accept if we step
[00:20:23 - 00:20:23] up speak out and take
[00:20:25 - 00:20:25] action we are capable of
[00:20:25 - 00:20:25] creating a action we are
[00:20:26 - 00:20:26] capable of creating a lasting
[00:20:26 - 00:20:29] lasting change however this despite
[00:20:29 - 00:20:30] the inspiration and opportunities for
[00:20:32 - 00:20:32] representation i also faced a
[00:20:32 - 00:20:35] moment of harsh reality when
[00:20:35 - 00:20:36] walking to the streets of
[00:20:38 - 00:20:38] austin with my peers we
[00:20:38 - 00:20:42] encountered an act of racism
[00:20:42 - 00:20:44] from a homeless individual this
[00:20:44 - 00:20:46] moment made me realize that
[00:20:46 - 00:20:46] despite the progress in many
[00:20:46 - 00:20:48] ways human society has bias
[00:20:48 - 00:20:51] will exist and will continue
[00:20:51 - 00:20:54] to exist even though i
[00:20:54 - 00:20:54] it will be a moment
[00:20:57 - 00:20:57] to define my trip as
[00:20:57 - 00:20:59] something bad i took this
[00:20:59 - 00:20:59] as a learning opportunity and
[00:21:00 - 00:21:00] reason to continue raising my
[00:21:00 - 00:21:02] voice and advocating for my
[00:21:04 - 00:21:04] rights coming back from austin
[00:21:04 - 00:21:07] i am more driven than
[00:21:07 - 00:21:07] ever i saw firstand the
[00:21:09 - 00:21:09] impact that community colleges have
[00:21:09 - 00:21:10] in shaping lives and how
[00:21:10 - 00:21:12] important it is for students
[00:21:12 - 00:21:12] like us to be involved
[00:21:12 - 00:21:12] in for students like us
[00:21:13 - 00:21:13] to be involved in the
[00:21:13 - 00:21:15] the conversation i also learned
[00:21:15 - 00:21:17] that adversity will always be
[00:21:17 - 00:21:20] present but what matters is
[00:21:20 - 00:21:20] how we respond to it
[00:21:20 - 00:21:22] and i choose to respond
[00:21:22 - 00:21:26] with strength knowledge and action
[00:21:26 - 00:21:26] once again thank you for
[00:21:26 - 00:21:28] giving me this opportunity thank
[00:21:28 - 00:21:30] you for investing in students
[00:21:30 - 00:21:32] and believing our boys deserve
[00:21:32 - 00:21:32] to be heard this trip
[00:21:34 - 00:21:34] changed my life and i
[00:21:34 - 00:21:36] hope that my experience can
[00:21:36 - 00:21:36] serve as a testament why
[00:21:37 - 00:21:37] sur pring community colleges is
[00:21:37 - 00:21:40] not just an investment in
[00:21:40 - 00:21:42] education but an investment in
[00:21:42 - 00:21:42] a better more just society
[00:21:45 - 00:21:45] thank you and go thank
[00:21:46 - 00:21:52] you and go hanos good

[00:21:55 - 00:21:55] of the board i am
[00:21:55 - 00:21:58] isak diaz palma i'm vice
[00:21:58 - 00:21:58] president of epcc sgaa and
[00:21:58 - 00:22:00] this evening i would like
[00:22:00 - 00:22:00] to take a moment to
[00:22:02 - 00:22:02] share some of the insights
[00:22:02 - 00:22:03] that we gained during our
[00:22:03 - 00:22:06] recent trip to austin for
[00:22:06 - 00:22:06] community college day but before
[00:22:06 - 00:22:07] i do i want to
[00:22:07 - 00:22:11] extend our sing gratitude to
[00:22:11 - 00:22:11] dr serata members of the
[00:22:11 - 00:22:13] board as well as to
[00:22:13 - 00:22:17] miss rivas um dr amaya
[00:22:17 - 00:22:19] miss olivas miss sanchez and
[00:22:19 - 00:22:19] everyone who play a role
[00:22:19 - 00:22:21] in making this race possible
[00:22:21 - 00:22:23] one of the main themes
[00:22:23 - 00:22:23] for our tree was advocacy
[00:22:25 - 00:22:25] which we understand as public
[00:22:25 - 00:22:28] support for a cause or
[00:22:28 - 00:22:30] policy advocacy is vital because
[00:22:30 - 00:22:30] it allow us to represent
[00:22:30 - 00:22:32] our community's interests and stand
[00:22:32 - 00:22:34] out for what matters the
[00:22:34 - 00:22:36] most throughout this experience we
[00:22:36 - 00:22:40] learned that advocacy can succeed
[00:22:40 - 00:22:40] when we put enough effort
[00:22:40 - 00:22:41] and more importantly when we
[00:22:41 - 00:22:44] come together as a collective
[00:22:44 - 00:22:46] force to pursue our goals
[00:22:46 - 00:22:46] i was truly inspired by
[00:22:46 - 00:22:48] walking through the capital aisles
[00:22:48 - 00:22:50] and getting to know how
[00:22:50 - 00:22:53] government works one memorable moment
[00:22:53 - 00:22:53] for me occ when i
[00:22:53 - 00:22:55] was in dr gonzalez office
[00:22:55 - 00:22:58] speaking with her staff one
[00:22:58 - 00:22:58] of her staff members told
[00:22:58 - 00:23:00] me not to lose hope
[00:23:00 - 00:23:03] even in the current challenging
[00:23:03 - 00:23:03] political climate as long as
[00:23:05 - 00:23:05] we continue to speak and
[00:23:05 - 00:23:08] stand out for what we
[00:23:08 - 00:23:08] believe in we will find
[00:23:08 - 00:23:10] a path forward it was
[00:23:10 - 00:23:10] at that moment that i
[00:23:12 - 00:23:12] truly realized the importance of
[00:23:12 - 00:23:15] our work every draft every
[00:23:15 - 00:23:17] training session every meeting and
[00:23:17 - 00:23:18] every bit of preparation had
[00:23:18 - 00:23:20] led us to this meaningful
[00:23:20 - 00:23:23] opportunity to advocate for our
[00:23:23 - 00:23:23] ca now that we're back
[00:23:23 - 00:23:26] in el paso i believe
[00:23:26 - 00:23:26] that our next responsibility is
[00:23:28 - 00:23:28] to share the knowledge we've
[00:23:28 - 00:23:30] gained with our fellow s
[00:23:30 - 00:23:30] members as well as with
[00:23:30 - 00:23:33] our friends and family this
[00:23:33 - 00:23:34] way the information we learn
[00:23:34 - 00:23:37] doesn't stay just with us
[00:23:37 - 00:23:37] but instead it spreads out
[00:23:37 - 00:23:40] to our community i remember
[00:23:40 - 00:23:42] when dr amaya was telling
[00:23:42 - 00:23:42] us when we were leaving
[00:23:42 - 00:23:44] the capital building that it's
[00:23:44 - 00:23:46] now up to us to
[00:23:46 - 00:23:46] pass on what we learn
[00:23:46 - 00:23:48] so that future generations and
[00:23:48 - 00:23:51] everyone in our network will
[00:23:51 - 00:23:51] be better equipped to make
[00:23:51 - 00:23:53] a difference once again thank
[00:23:53 - 00:23:55] you for this incredible opportunity
[00:23:55 - 00:23:57] we are excited to continue
[00:23:57 - 00:23:59] participating in events like this
[00:23:59 - 00:23:59] so so that we can
[00:23:59 - 00:24:02] keep learning and contributing to
[00:24:02 - 00:24:03] a brighter future not only
[00:24:03 - 00:24:03] for ourselves but for our
[00:24:03 - 00:24:12] entire you thank you all

[00:24:45 - 00:24:45] uh greetings trustees mr president
[00:24:47 - 00:24:47] vice presidents deans guests in
[00:24:47 - 00:24:50] person and in the vastness
[00:24:50 - 00:24:52] of cyers space two years
[00:24:52 - 00:24:53] ago the dominant political party
[00:24:53 - 00:24:55] in texas attempted to eliminate
[00:24:55 - 00:24:58] tenure in texas public colleges
[00:24:58 - 00:25:01] and universities fortunately that effort
[00:25:01 - 00:25:01] failed two years later in
[00:25:03 - 00:25:03] the present day that political
[00:25:03 - 00:25:05] party is once again advocating
[00:25:05 - 00:25:08] the elimination of tenure as
[00:25:08 - 00:25:08] i did back in 2023
[00:25:08 - 00:25:10] i quote the great american
[00:25:10 - 00:25:13] patriot thomas payne when i
[00:25:13 - 00:25:13] say these are the times
[00:25:13 - 00:25:16] that try men's souls the
[00:25:16 - 00:25:18] official party platform of that
[00:25:18 - 00:25:18] dominant political party states in
[00:25:18 - 00:25:20] that dominant political party states
[00:25:20 - 00:25:25] in paragraph paragraph 108 we
[00:25:25 - 00:25:25] support abolishing the system of
[00:25:28 - 00:25:28] tenure in academia and advocate
[00:25:28 - 00:25:30] ate replacing it with a
[00:25:30 - 00:25:33] merit-based system for teacher retention
[00:25:33 - 00:25:34] of course this political party
[00:25:34 - 00:25:34] would be the one to
[00:25:36 - 00:25:36] write the rules for retention
[00:25:36 - 00:25:40] and those rules would undoubtedly
[00:25:40 - 00:25:42] state their particular propaganda in
[00:25:42 - 00:25:44] addition texas state representative matthew
[00:25:46 - 00:25:46] shaban a member of the
[00:25:46 - 00:25:49] dominant political party has introduced
[00:25:49 - 00:25:52] hb1 1830 which states an
[00:25:52 - 00:25:54] institution of higher education may
[00:25:54 - 00:25:57] not grant an employee of
[00:25:57 - 00:26:00] the institution tenure or any
[00:26:00 - 00:26:00] type of permanent employment status
[00:26:02 - 00:26:02] here we go again folks
[00:26:02 - 00:26:04] that same dominant political party
[00:26:04 - 00:26:05] is for the second legislative
[00:26:05 - 00:26:08] session in a row seeking
[00:26:08 - 00:26:08] to deprive us of our
[00:26:10 - 00:26:10] livelihood but this should come
[00:26:10 - 00:26:12] as no surprise as the
[00:26:12 - 00:26:14] same political party at the
[00:26:14 - 00:26:15] national level has already deprived
[00:26:16 - 00:26:16] thousands of federal government workers
[00:26:18 - 00:26:18] of their livelihood and a
[00:26:18 - 00:26:22] most capricious vengeful and uncaring
[00:26:24 - 00:26:24] attitude to paraphrase the great
[00:26:24 - 00:26:25] thomas jefferson and the declaration
[00:26:26 - 00:26:28] of independence that particular political
[00:26:28 - 00:26:29] independence that particular political party
[00:26:29 - 00:26:31] party whose character is thus
[00:26:31 - 00:26:35] marked by every act which
[00:26:35 - 00:26:35] may define a tyrant is
[00:26:35 - 00:26:37] unfit to be the ruler

[00:27:21 - 00:27:23] to you about our quality
[00:27:23 - 00:27:26] enhancement plan otherwise known as
[00:27:26 - 00:27:26] the q as dr sra

[00:27:33 - 00:27:33] to talk just a little
[00:27:33 - 00:27:36] bit about what is our
[00:27:36 - 00:27:36] q as well as some
[00:27:36 - 00:27:43] of far okay so um
[00:27:43 - 00:27:45] first you should know that
[00:27:45 - 00:27:45] our q is part of
[00:27:45 - 00:27:48] our accreditation process it's required
[00:27:48 - 00:27:50] to address either student learning
[00:27:50 - 00:27:53] or student success there are
[00:27:53 - 00:27:53] two requirements for the topic
[00:27:55 - 00:27:55] one it must be data
[00:27:55 - 00:27:57] driven and it must be
[00:27:57 - 00:27:57] selected through a process involving
[00:28:00 - 00:28:00] all institutional stakeholders for us
[00:28:00 - 00:28:02] in our process a couple
[00:28:02 - 00:28:02] years ago we had a
[00:28:05 - 00:28:05] qep topic selection task force
[00:28:05 - 00:28:07] that had a lot of
[00:28:07 - 00:28:09] institutional stakeholders um they looked
[00:28:09 - 00:28:09] at the data we had
[00:28:09 - 00:28:12] two institutional wide surveys we
[00:28:12 - 00:28:15] then also had a qp
[00:28:15 - 00:28:15] town hall um afterwards once
[00:28:15 - 00:28:18] we had our topic we
[00:28:18 - 00:28:19] then had a qep development
[00:28:19 - 00:28:21] task force with more stakeholders
[00:28:21 - 00:28:21] to come up with our
[00:28:23 - 00:28:23] interventions so let me tell
[00:28:23 - 00:28:25] you a little bit about
[00:28:25 - 00:28:25] the cycle it takes 5
[00:28:27 - 00:28:27] years to develop a plan
[00:28:27 - 00:28:30] this plan is then reviewed
[00:28:30 - 00:28:30] by sac crc and they
[00:28:30 - 00:28:32] give us our recommendations or
[00:28:32 - 00:28:34] suggestions at that point we
[00:28:34 - 00:28:34] have 5 years to implement
[00:28:37 - 00:28:37] our plan then we turn
[00:28:37 - 00:28:40] in a five-year report to
[00:28:40 - 00:28:40] sac crc we are now
[00:28:40 - 00:28:42] in our third year of
[00:28:45 - 00:28:45] implementation so our qp is
[00:28:45 - 00:28:48] find your way connect discover
[00:28:48 - 00:28:51] succeed our focus is to
[00:28:51 - 00:28:52] improve student success our primary
[00:28:52 - 00:28:52] goal is that students take
[00:28:54 - 00:28:54] ownership of their academic and
[00:28:54 - 00:28:57] career paths and our primary
[00:28:57 - 00:28:59] assessment is the decrease of
[00:28:59 - 00:29:02] um the average semester credit
[00:29:02 - 00:29:04] hours for um our graduates
[00:29:04 - 00:29:04] now we have three sets
[00:29:04 - 00:29:07] of in interventions the first
[00:29:07 - 00:29:09] set has to do with
[00:29:09 - 00:29:09] communication so um we're talking
[00:29:11 - 00:29:11] about communicating with students both
[00:29:13 - 00:29:13] um about programs events as
[00:29:13 - 00:29:16] well as the colleg goinging

[00:29:30 - 00:29:30] it in spanish um it
[00:29:30 - 00:29:32] covers expectations such as you're
[00:29:32 - 00:29:32] supposed to go to new
[00:29:34 - 00:29:34] student orientation nso you're supposed
[00:29:36 - 00:29:36] to visit your first year
[00:29:36 - 00:29:38] experience adviser and do something
[00:29:38 - 00:29:40] called an educational plan and
[00:29:40 - 00:29:42] i'll tell you about that
[00:29:42 - 00:29:42] what that is in just
[00:29:42 - 00:29:45] a moment we also have
[00:29:45 - 00:29:45] requests to promote forms now
[00:29:47 - 00:29:47] the idea here is that
[00:29:47 - 00:29:50] we have this hub my
[00:29:50 - 00:29:50] pcc edu that has announcements
[00:29:50 - 00:29:52] and upcoming events and we
[00:29:52 - 00:29:52] want that to be a
[00:29:54 - 00:29:54] main communication hub for our
[00:29:54 - 00:29:57] students so in order to
[00:29:57 - 00:29:59] encourage ownership of this site
[00:29:59 - 00:29:59] from our faculty and staff
[00:30:00 - 00:30:00] we've asked them to do
[00:30:00 - 00:30:02] um complete requests to promote
[00:30:02 - 00:30:05] forms whenever they have an
[00:30:05 - 00:30:05] event in this way the
[00:30:05 - 00:30:07] the sites populate with all
[00:30:07 - 00:30:08] of our events and they're
[00:30:08 - 00:30:08] telling other students hey this
[00:30:10 - 00:30:10] is the place to go
[00:30:10 - 00:30:10] and this has really is
[00:30:10 - 00:30:10] the place to go and
[00:30:10 - 00:30:11] this has really been been
[00:30:13 - 00:30:13] successful also um new student
[00:30:15 - 00:30:15] orientation had a little bit
[00:30:15 - 00:30:17] of a boost we gave
[00:30:17 - 00:30:17] 10 interns for new student
[00:30:19 - 00:30:19] orientation um these interns were
[00:30:21 - 00:30:21] incredibly important because they did
[00:30:21 - 00:30:22] a lot of the community
[00:30:22 - 00:30:25] outreach outreach to students new
[00:30:25 - 00:30:26] students to come furthermore this
[00:30:26 - 00:30:26] became a place that we
[00:30:29 - 00:30:29] can give really important information
[00:30:29 - 00:30:31] so for example we had
[00:30:31 - 00:30:33] students on our task force
[00:30:33 - 00:30:33] as well as on our
[00:30:33 - 00:30:35] in um in the town
[00:30:35 - 00:30:35] hall who mentioned that they
[00:30:35 - 00:30:37] didn't even know they were
[00:30:37 - 00:30:38] supposed to do epcc email
[00:30:38 - 00:30:38] the first couple of months
[00:30:38 - 00:30:40] they were here and so
[00:30:40 - 00:30:42] we knew there was something
[00:30:42 - 00:30:42] that we need to address
[00:30:42 - 00:30:44] at nso we have computers
[00:30:44 - 00:30:44] and one of the things
[00:30:46 - 00:30:46] they absolutely um the interns
[00:30:46 - 00:30:48] do is that once they
[00:30:48 - 00:30:48] come in they say hey
[00:30:48 - 00:30:51] have you entered your epcc
[00:30:51 - 00:30:53] email yet have you logged
[00:30:53 - 00:30:53] in would you like help
[00:30:53 - 00:30:54] and they do that in
[00:30:54 - 00:30:54] the beginning at breaks and
[00:30:56 - 00:30:56] at the end and of
[00:30:56 - 00:30:58] course we assess that as
[00:30:58 - 00:30:58] well forther this is a
[00:30:58 - 00:31:00] place they learn about degree
[00:31:00 - 00:31:02] works this is the program
[00:31:02 - 00:31:02] that students can digitally look
[00:31:04 - 00:31:04] at their um degree plan
[00:31:04 - 00:31:06] and they can also play
[00:31:06 - 00:31:06] around with it a little
[00:31:06 - 00:31:08] bit like hey what happens
[00:31:08 - 00:31:09] if i decide to change
[00:31:09 - 00:31:09] my major how many more
[00:31:09 - 00:31:11] classes would i have to
[00:31:11 - 00:31:11] take it's a great tool
[00:31:13 - 00:31:13] and finally again they hear
[00:31:13 - 00:31:15] about first year experience advisers
[00:31:15 - 00:31:15] and to do those year
[00:31:15 - 00:31:16] experience advisers and to do
[00:31:16 - 00:31:20] those educational educational plans now
[00:31:20 - 00:31:20] there's another part of our
[00:31:20 - 00:31:21] cp and that has to
[00:31:21 - 00:31:21] do with the faculty we
[00:31:24 - 00:31:24] invited all the disciplines to
[00:31:24 - 00:31:26] do one of three interventions
[00:31:26 - 00:31:26] one is a career day
[00:31:27 - 00:31:27] event and you'll see the
[00:31:27 - 00:31:29] two pictures there are from
[00:31:29 - 00:31:32] previous career day events um
[00:31:32 - 00:31:32] these are very big events
[00:31:32 - 00:31:34] that address hundreds of students
[00:31:34 - 00:31:35] they're a big deal um
[00:31:35 - 00:31:35] it take a lot it
[00:31:35 - 00:31:38] takes a lot to host
[00:31:38 - 00:31:38] them um but they put
[00:31:38 - 00:31:40] in the work and effort
[00:31:40 - 00:31:40] and um the idea is
[00:31:40 - 00:31:42] that we have people from
[00:31:42 - 00:31:45] the community that come in
[00:31:45 - 00:31:45] and talk about careers um
[00:31:45 - 00:31:47] as from in the community
[00:31:47 - 00:31:47] as well as say um
[00:31:47 - 00:31:48] what kind of career can
[00:31:48 - 00:31:49] you get with a philosophy
[00:31:49 - 00:31:52] degree with a criminal justice
[00:31:52 - 00:31:52] degree these are great events
[00:31:53 - 00:31:53] that students really have a
[00:31:53 - 00:31:55] lot of take a lot
[00:31:55 - 00:31:55] of value in um the
[00:31:55 - 00:31:57] carew reflection assignment so we
[00:31:57 - 00:31:58] have two different types of
[00:31:58 - 00:31:59] assign assignments a career reflection
[00:31:59 - 00:32:01] assignment and an assignment using
[00:32:01 - 00:32:02] degree works that program we
[00:32:02 - 00:32:04] talked about that digitally looks
[00:32:04 - 00:32:06] at those um degree plans
[00:32:06 - 00:32:06] so these run the gamut
[00:32:06 - 00:32:08] these aren't one set assignments
[00:32:08 - 00:32:10] these assignments are owned by
[00:32:10 - 00:32:12] faculty and disciplines and they
[00:32:12 - 00:32:14] run the gamut from doing
[00:32:14 - 00:32:16] journal entries to doing reflection
[00:32:16 - 00:32:19] um homework assignments posters projects
[00:32:19 - 00:32:22] they um they've really taken
[00:32:22 - 00:32:22] ownership of this project and
[00:32:22 - 00:32:25] um it's throughout all of
[00:32:25 - 00:32:25] the the um all of
[00:32:29 - 00:32:29] the different uh ah lost
[00:32:29 - 00:32:32] by tr thought all the
[00:32:32 - 00:32:32] different um uh disciplines that
[00:32:34 - 00:32:36] are are are implementing those
[00:32:36 - 00:32:36] okay finally we get to
[00:32:36 - 00:32:38] the educational plans yay all
[00:32:38 - 00:32:40] right so the educational plans
[00:32:40 - 00:32:42] are different than degree plans
[00:32:42 - 00:32:42] in a really important way
[00:32:42 - 00:32:45] a degree plan is a
[00:32:45 - 00:32:47] list of required preset courses
[00:32:47 - 00:32:47] in each program of study
[00:32:47 - 00:32:50] whereas an education plan is
[00:32:50 - 00:32:52] a step-by-step roap that can
[00:32:52 - 00:32:54] be customized toward students individual
[00:32:54 - 00:32:54] needs this means um as
[00:32:54 - 00:32:56] they meet with the students
[00:32:56 - 00:32:58] um the first year experience
[00:32:58 - 00:32:58] advisors meet with them twice
[00:33:00 - 00:33:00] in the fall twice in
[00:33:00 - 00:33:02] the spring they have these
[00:33:02 - 00:33:04] conversations and it talks more
[00:33:04 - 00:33:04] about not just here's your
[00:33:04 - 00:33:06] degree plan but the challenges
[00:33:06 - 00:33:08] they may have um the
[00:33:08 - 00:33:08] um changes in their lives
[00:33:08 - 00:33:11] that might happen um they
[00:33:11 - 00:33:13] are also these fy advisers
[00:33:13 - 00:33:13] become an important bridge to
[00:33:15 - 00:33:15] all the different resources we
[00:33:15 - 00:33:16] have hey you're having a
[00:33:16 - 00:33:18] problem figuring out this is
[00:33:18 - 00:33:18] the right career for you
[00:33:18 - 00:33:20] go to career and transfer
[00:33:20 - 00:33:23] services you need to um
[00:33:23 - 00:33:23] work full-time instead of part-time
[00:33:25 - 00:33:25] hey maybe you can look
[00:33:25 - 00:33:27] at some of the scholarship
[00:33:27 - 00:33:28] opportunities we have um you're
[00:33:28 - 00:33:28] having some trouble with one
[00:33:28 - 00:33:29] of these courses that you
[00:33:29 - 00:33:30] need to pass to move
[00:33:30 - 00:33:30] forward did you know about
[00:33:30 - 00:33:32] our tutoring so they become
[00:33:32 - 00:33:35] a great bridge for that
[00:33:35 - 00:33:35] um so and they hear
[00:33:35 - 00:33:37] about the expectation for doing
[00:33:37 - 00:33:39] these education plans remember it's
[00:33:39 - 00:33:41] it's kind of stacked they
[00:33:41 - 00:33:41] hear it from that video
[00:33:41 - 00:33:43] they hear it at nso
[00:33:43 - 00:33:43] they get an invite through
[00:33:44 - 00:33:44] email which is why it's
[00:33:44 - 00:33:46] so important they enter that
[00:33:46 - 00:33:46] email and then they also
[00:33:48 - 00:33:48] hear it from faculty and
[00:33:48 - 00:33:51] other counselors okay so the
[00:33:54 - 00:33:54] data um this is some
[00:33:54 - 00:33:56] of the data because we
[00:33:56 - 00:33:56] have a lot of data
[00:33:56 - 00:33:58] but the data in general
[00:33:58 - 00:33:58] really shows um positive all
[00:33:58 - 00:34:00] the way through so here
[00:34:00 - 00:34:02] is um a screenshot from
[00:34:02 - 00:34:02] our start here video um
[00:34:02 - 00:34:05] we started with 1 349
[00:34:05 - 00:34:08] clicks in 2022 we this
[00:34:08 - 00:34:08] past year it's done by
[00:34:10 - 00:34:12] january to january 1 864
[00:34:12 - 00:34:12] combined clicks and so we're
[00:34:15 - 00:34:15] moving up the request remote
[00:34:15 - 00:34:17] forms are also moving up
[00:34:17 - 00:34:17] from 93 in the academic
[00:34:21 - 00:34:21] year of 2022 2023 to
[00:34:21 - 00:34:23] 154 this last past academic
[00:34:23 - 00:34:23] year and i just recently
[00:34:23 - 00:34:25] talked to jim heiney who
[00:34:25 - 00:34:26] said that we're already past
[00:34:26 - 00:34:26] that number and we're only
[00:34:29 - 00:34:30] in february new st orientation
[00:34:30 - 00:34:30] has some of the best
[00:34:33 - 00:34:33] data so um we're up
[00:34:33 - 00:34:33] to this they do it
[00:34:36 - 00:34:36] by season season of summer
[00:34:36 - 00:34:40] so this is season 2024
[00:34:40 - 00:34:43] just last summer 3 197
[00:34:43 - 00:34:44] participants which represent 80 of
[00:34:44 - 00:34:44] our ftic that's the best
[00:34:44 - 00:34:48] we've ever had um that's
[00:34:48 - 00:34:48] up from 2766 which is
[00:34:48 - 00:34:51] 65 of fts um back
[00:34:51 - 00:34:54] in 2023 so we assess
[00:34:54 - 00:34:57] every single part um this
[00:34:57 - 00:34:57] is from an exit survey
[00:34:57 - 00:34:58] so 83 respondents from that
[00:34:58 - 00:35:01] survey logged into their email
[00:35:01 - 00:35:01] 95 said they were confident
[00:35:03 - 00:35:03] using degree works coming out
[00:35:03 - 00:35:05] of nso and 93 respondents
[00:35:05 - 00:35:08] planned to meet with their
[00:35:08 - 00:35:12] fy adviser all good stuff
[00:35:12 - 00:35:12] career day events since 2022
[00:35:12 - 00:35:15] we've had 62 career events
[00:35:15 - 00:35:18] which is incredible that served
[00:35:18 - 00:35:18] 4 419 students um we've
[00:35:18 - 00:35:22] had 30 different disciplines participate
[00:35:22 - 00:35:24] 98 of the again we
[00:35:24 - 00:35:24] do an exit survey for
[00:35:26 - 00:35:26] this as well 98 of
[00:35:26 - 00:35:27] the respondents reported that the
[00:35:27 - 00:35:30] events were good use of
[00:35:30 - 00:35:30] their time and 96 talked
[00:35:30 - 00:35:32] about how the information was
[00:35:32 - 00:35:34] valuable to them so clearly
[00:35:34 - 00:35:35] students are um these experiences
[00:35:35 - 00:35:35] are important for their for
[00:35:35 - 00:35:36] experiences are important for their
[00:35:36 - 00:35:39] for our our students so
[00:35:39 - 00:35:41] our total completed surveys for
[00:35:41 - 00:35:41] career reflection assignment and the
[00:35:43 - 00:35:43] assignment using degree works is
[00:35:45 - 00:35:45] 3 75 that's our number
[00:35:45 - 00:35:47] that they completed the survey
[00:35:47 - 00:35:49] but obviously it's only a
[00:35:49 - 00:35:49] fraction of the number of
[00:35:49 - 00:35:51] those who actually did the
[00:35:51 - 00:35:54] assignments um we also from
[00:35:54 - 00:35:54] these 80 said that their
[00:35:56 - 00:35:56] career reflection assignment was useful
[00:35:58 - 00:35:58] to them even though 40
[00:35:58 - 00:36:00] 1 previously did a similar
[00:36:00 - 00:36:00] assignment that was one of
[00:36:00 - 00:36:02] our concerns hey if they're
[00:36:02 - 00:36:03] doing reflection over here and
[00:36:03 - 00:36:06] reflection over here wouldn't that
[00:36:06 - 00:36:06] become roote but this um
[00:36:07 - 00:36:07] this inter intervention was grounded
[00:36:08 - 00:36:10] in the research that students
[00:36:10 - 00:36:12] needed to have repetition it
[00:36:12 - 00:36:14] wasn't enough to have one
[00:36:14 - 00:36:14] class where they talked about
[00:36:14 - 00:36:15] p reflection and then didn't
[00:36:15 - 00:36:18] do it ever again so
[00:36:18 - 00:36:18] this actual data supports that
[00:36:20 - 00:36:20] as well and also the
[00:36:20 - 00:36:22] assignments using degree works 87
[00:36:22 - 00:36:23] said that the assignment was
[00:36:23 - 00:36:25] useful to them even though
[00:36:25 - 00:36:25] almost 50 had used degree
[00:36:25 - 00:36:29] works before they still found
[00:36:29 - 00:36:31] value in these assignments and
[00:36:31 - 00:36:33] finally our first year experience
[00:36:33 - 00:36:33] um we went up from
[00:36:33 - 00:36:37] 1 022 which is 24
[00:36:37 - 00:36:37] of f tixs in 2022
[00:36:37 - 00:36:41] 2023 to 1 200 which
[00:36:41 - 00:36:41] is 30 of ftic we
[00:36:41 - 00:36:42] can't wait to see that
[00:36:43 - 00:36:45] number grow and finally our
[00:36:45 - 00:36:47] average semester credit hours we
[00:36:47 - 00:36:52] noticed a nice downward turn
[00:36:52 - 00:36:52] 78 to 75 to 74
[00:36:52 - 00:36:52] um a small caveat i
[00:36:53 - 00:36:53] would mention that the qp
[00:36:53 - 00:36:56] only started two years ago
[00:36:56 - 00:36:56] so it's unlikely that the
[00:36:58 - 00:36:58] q had a huge impact
[00:36:58 - 00:36:59] on these particular numbers and
[00:36:59 - 00:36:59] far more likely we have
[00:37:01 - 00:37:01] other interventions here at epcc
[00:37:01 - 00:37:03] that affected these numbers but
[00:37:03 - 00:37:05] i would say that student
[00:37:05 - 00:37:07] success is everyone's business here
[00:37:07 - 00:37:08] at el paso community college
[00:37:08 - 00:37:08] and so we should all
[00:37:08 - 00:37:11] be proud about these numbers
[00:37:11 - 00:37:25] any you section 1 9
[00:37:25 - 00:37:28] board of trustees business item

[00:37:39 - 00:37:41] installation of certain american flag

[00:38:17 - 00:38:17] by the board in years
[00:38:17 - 00:38:19] past this is just to
[00:38:19 - 00:38:19] provide them an ability to
[00:38:19 - 00:38:23] plant the flags alongside uh
[00:38:23 - 00:38:24] epcc property and it's only
[00:38:24 - 00:38:26] limited to that specific purpose
[00:38:26 - 00:38:26] is that what the limited
[00:38:26 - 00:38:31] means just restricted the area

[00:52:00 - 00:52:04] a send fellow in the
[00:52:04 - 00:52:07] postsecondary success for parents initiative
[00:52:07 - 00:52:07] so in 2021 we surveyed
[00:52:10 - 00:52:10] students and we asked them
[00:52:10 - 00:52:13] what can we do to
[00:52:13 - 00:52:13] assist you what can we
[00:52:13 - 00:52:16] do to help you persist
[00:52:16 - 00:52:16] and graduate so what they
[00:52:18 - 00:52:18] said was it'd be great
[00:52:18 - 00:52:21] if there was a center
[00:52:21 - 00:52:21] a student parent resource center
[00:52:24 - 00:52:24] that we know was for
[00:52:24 - 00:52:27] us that we could get
[00:52:27 - 00:52:27] the help we needed we
[00:52:27 - 00:52:31] als also would like lactation
[00:52:31 - 00:52:33] rooms at each campus they
[00:52:33 - 00:52:33] also said it'd be great
[00:52:33 - 00:52:36] if the college had more
[00:52:36 - 00:52:39] familyfriendly practices including course scheduling
[00:52:42 - 00:52:42] and two generation event programming
[00:52:42 - 00:52:45] and it'd be great if
[00:52:45 - 00:52:49] we could get referrals to
[00:52:49 - 00:52:49] um college and community resources
[00:52:53 - 00:52:53] and services so by 2023
[00:52:53 - 00:52:55] we open up the student
[00:52:55 - 00:52:55] parent resource centers at every
[00:52:58 - 00:52:58] campus we open lactation rooms

[00:53:02 - 00:53:08] have lactation pods also at
[00:53:08 - 00:53:08] every campus um and we
[00:53:08 - 00:53:12] are now moving into helping
[00:53:12 - 00:53:12] them with the college and
[00:53:15 - 00:53:15] community support referrals being on
[00:53:18 - 00:53:18] campus in addition to that
[00:53:18 - 00:53:20] allows us to increase the
[00:53:20 - 00:53:22] awareness of other programs that
[00:53:22 - 00:53:22] we have we focus on
[00:53:22 - 00:53:24] four impact areas which are
