[00:05:13 - 00:05:16] adopted budget and projected expenditures
[00:05:18 - 00:05:18] and then these next two
[00:05:18 - 00:05:20] items will guide the budget
[00:05:20 - 00:05:23] development for next year we'll
[00:05:23 - 00:05:23] look at an overview of

[00:05:30 - 00:05:30] we'll look at uh the
[00:05:30 - 00:05:31] baseline budget this is based
[00:05:31 - 00:05:35] upon the submission by all
[00:05:35 - 00:05:39] the executive uh level that's
[00:05:39 - 00:05:39] represented here on my right
[00:05:43 - 00:05:43] and then um that will
[00:05:43 - 00:05:45] result in preliminary budget strategies
[00:05:45 - 00:05:46] that's more a compilation of
[00:05:46 - 00:05:49] the projected revenues expenditures and
[00:05:49 - 00:05:52] different scenarios for your consideration
[00:05:55 - 00:05:55] and then uh the 4-year
[00:05:55 - 00:05:57] financial model has been updated
[00:05:59 - 00:05:59] and then we'll look at
[00:05:59 - 00:06:03] next steps for adoption of
[00:06:03 - 00:06:03] the fisc year 2526 adoption
[00:06:04 - 00:06:06] of the fisc year 2526
[00:06:07 - 00:06:08] budget i know that many
[00:06:08 - 00:06:08] of you have seen this
[00:06:11 - 00:06:11] slide before but there's a
[00:06:11 - 00:06:14] couple of newer board members
[00:06:14 - 00:06:14] uh as part of the
[00:06:17 - 00:06:17] team so i will review
[00:06:17 - 00:06:19] it again in february the
[00:06:19 - 00:06:21] budget workshops are presented by
[00:06:21 - 00:06:25] miss stis to district staff
[00:06:25 - 00:06:25] she holds two workshops per
[00:06:25 - 00:06:27] year where they are updated
[00:06:27 - 00:06:29] on uh on the budget
[00:06:29 - 00:06:29] process if they have any
[00:06:31 - 00:06:31] questions any new managers are
[00:06:31 - 00:06:34] provided the opportunity to attend
[00:06:34 - 00:06:36] and she provides hands-on training
[00:06:36 - 00:06:39] uh people can log on
[00:06:39 - 00:06:39] to their budgets and banner
[00:06:41 - 00:06:41] and so she does a
[00:06:41 - 00:06:43] great job with that in
[00:06:43 - 00:06:43] february also the budget requests
[00:06:43 - 00:06:47] are completed by the executive
[00:06:47 - 00:06:49] level that is represented here
[00:06:49 - 00:06:52] today march 7th is the
[00:06:52 - 00:06:56] deadline for their submission of
[00:06:56 - 00:06:59] budgets march through april the
[00:06:59 - 00:06:59] budget office compiles all of
[00:07:02 - 00:07:02] those submissions by the executive
[00:07:02 - 00:07:05] level and produces a baseline
[00:07:05 - 00:07:09] budget from their submissions we'll
[00:07:09 - 00:07:09] be seeing the baseline budget
[00:07:09 - 00:07:12] in later slides april through
[00:07:12 - 00:07:14] may meetings are held with
[00:07:14 - 00:07:16] the vice presidents to review
[00:07:16 - 00:07:16] their respective budgets to see
[00:07:18 - 00:07:18] if they have any questions
[00:07:18 - 00:07:20] anything that we can help
[00:07:20 - 00:07:22] them with on their budget
[00:07:22 - 00:07:24] development that's their opportunity to
[00:07:24 - 00:07:29] review what they're submitting and
[00:07:29 - 00:07:29] uh ask us any questions
[00:07:31 - 00:07:31] that we might help them
[00:07:31 - 00:07:33] with in the may time
[00:07:33 - 00:07:33] period we meet with dr
[00:07:33 - 00:07:37] sarata and present him the
[00:07:37 - 00:07:40] baseline budget based upon the
[00:07:40 - 00:07:42] executive level submission and so
[00:07:42 - 00:07:42] we go over the revenue
[00:07:42 - 00:07:45] projections and talk about any
[00:07:45 - 00:07:48] budget strategies that uh we
[00:07:48 - 00:07:48] need to consider any salary
[00:07:51 - 00:07:51] enhancement options that uh might
[00:07:51 - 00:07:55] be supported by the projected
[00:07:55 - 00:07:58] revenues and we have those
[00:07:58 - 00:08:02] kinds of discussions after that
[00:08:02 - 00:08:04] um in july we're going
[00:08:04 - 00:08:06] to review and approve additional
[00:08:06 - 00:08:10] funding requests that have been
[00:08:10 - 00:08:10] vetted by dr set that
[00:08:10 - 00:08:12] has not happened yet so
[00:08:12 - 00:08:12] we were that's going to
[00:08:14 - 00:08:14] be our next uh step
[00:08:14 - 00:08:15] in the budget be our
[00:08:15 - 00:08:16] next uh step in the
[00:08:16 - 00:08:19] budget process process and usually
[00:08:19 - 00:08:19] results in lower numbers i
[00:08:24 - 00:08:24] might add so um in
[00:08:24 - 00:08:27] june through august we present
[00:08:27 - 00:08:27] workshops to the board as
[00:08:27 - 00:08:30] the as the numbers are
[00:08:30 - 00:08:30] firmed up and we get
[00:08:32 - 00:08:32] clarification on any issues on
[00:08:32 - 00:08:35] funding that we are seeking
[00:08:38 - 00:08:38] and then results in august
[00:08:38 - 00:08:41] with the adoption of the
[00:08:41 - 00:08:41] budget by the board of
[00:08:41 - 00:08:46] adoption of the budget by
[00:08:47 - 00:08:52] the board of trustees this
[00:08:52 - 00:08:52] is um overview of the
[00:08:52 - 00:08:55] budget development process a little
[00:08:55 - 00:08:57] bit higher level um the
[00:08:57 - 00:09:00] process started in february as
[00:09:00 - 00:09:00] i mentioned we're going to
[00:09:02 - 00:09:02] look at current year fiscal
[00:09:02 - 00:09:05] revenues which are the basis
[00:09:05 - 00:09:07] for revenue projections for next
[00:09:07 - 00:09:11] year so those are uh
[00:09:11 - 00:09:14] impacted by enrollment uh interest
[00:09:14 - 00:09:14] rates uh things that are
[00:09:16 - 00:09:16] happening at the state level
[00:09:16 - 00:09:20] where we base the projections
[00:09:20 - 00:09:23] on um then we're going
[00:09:23 - 00:09:23] to look at the 2526
[00:09:23 - 00:09:29] budget based on rollover of
[00:09:29 - 00:09:29] the current 2425 adopted budget
[00:09:29 - 00:09:31] and it's adjusted for any
[00:09:31 - 00:09:34] salary savings from vacant positions
[00:09:34 - 00:09:42] and reallocation additional requests are
[00:09:42 - 00:09:44] submitted by the executive levels
[00:09:44 - 00:09:44] and are reviewed by the
[00:09:46 - 00:09:46] budget office and vetted for
[00:09:46 - 00:09:49] funding by the president that
[00:09:49 - 00:09:49] is a major step in
[00:09:52 - 00:09:54] budget development as well and
[00:09:54 - 00:09:54] then we will evaluate salary
[00:09:57 - 00:09:57] enhancement to remain competitive in
[00:10:02 - 00:10:02] hiring and retaining faculty and
[00:10:02 - 00:10:03] staff so these are the
[00:10:03 - 00:10:05] some of the key timelines
[00:10:05 - 00:10:05] that are going to guide
[00:10:05 - 00:10:10] us in our process and
[00:10:10 - 00:10:10] as a reminder uh the
[00:10:10 - 00:10:22] board has to so for
[00:10:22 - 00:10:22] the current year this is
[00:10:22 - 00:10:25] what the revenues sources look
[00:10:25 - 00:10:28] like for the current year
[00:10:28 - 00:10:28] our budget is 166 4
[00:10:28 - 00:10:31] 4 million and the revenue
[00:10:31 - 00:10:34] sources are comprised by the
[00:10:34 - 00:10:38] largest property tax property tax
[00:10:38 - 00:10:41] revenue 73 million almost 44
[00:10:41 - 00:10:41] of the budget followed by
[00:10:41 - 00:10:48] state appropriations 44 1 at
[00:10:48 - 00:10:48] 26 5 of the budget
[00:10:48 - 00:10:51] tuition and fees 39 million
[00:10:51 - 00:10:51] 23 those are the three
[00:10:53 - 00:10:53] largest categories of revenue sources
[00:10:56 - 00:10:56] for the district in addition
[00:10:56 - 00:11:01] we have self-supporting programs um
[00:11:01 - 00:11:03] estimated at 3 million other
[00:11:03 - 00:11:06] income largely comprised of interest
[00:11:06 - 00:11:12] income 6 3 million and
[00:11:12 - 00:11:12] then we have overhead recovery
[00:11:12 - 00:11:14] this is recoupment of the
[00:11:14 - 00:11:17] administrative cost related to grants
[00:11:17 - 00:11:19] and contracts grants and contracts
[00:11:19 - 00:11:21] allow for entities to charge
[00:11:21 - 00:11:24] an administrative fee it's called
[00:11:24 - 00:11:24] an overhead recovery fee and
[00:11:24 - 00:11:26] so that brings in revenue
[00:11:26 - 00:11:33] when we manage so these
[00:11:33 - 00:11:36] are the expenditures supporting the
[00:11:36 - 00:11:36] current budget that we are
[00:11:36 - 00:11:41] operating under and so um
[00:11:41 - 00:11:46] the largest category here is
[00:11:46 - 00:11:46] instruction 55 1 million 33
[00:11:46 - 00:11:50] of the budget uh followed
[00:11:50 - 00:11:54] by institutional support almost 51
[00:11:54 - 00:11:58] million academic support 20 7
[00:12:02 - 00:12:02] student services 12 million physical
[00:12:05 - 00:12:09] plan 13 3 million followed
[00:12:09 - 00:12:09] by uh public service over
[00:12:09 - 00:12:13] here 3 4 4 research
[00:12:13 - 00:12:16] 214 000 um the classification
[00:12:16 - 00:12:18] method here that we're required
[00:12:18 - 00:12:21] to follow is prescribed by
[00:12:21 - 00:12:21] nubu national association of college
[00:12:24 - 00:12:24] and university business officers so
[00:12:26 - 00:12:26] this is the classifications that
[00:12:26 - 00:12:29] we have here uh also
[00:12:29 - 00:12:29] would let you know that
[00:12:31 - 00:12:31] this classification is the same
[00:12:31 - 00:12:32] one that you would see
[00:12:32 - 00:12:33] in our financial you would
[00:12:34 - 00:12:37] see in our financial statements
[00:12:41 - 00:12:41] bernie sir instructional support that's
[00:12:43 - 00:12:43] salary up to the in
[00:12:43 - 00:12:43] classroom level salary up to
[00:12:43 - 00:12:43] the in classroom level right

[00:12:45 - 00:12:45] that's all the yes sir
[00:12:45 - 00:12:46] those that's that's all the
[00:12:46 - 00:12:48] faculty faculty and the faculty
[00:12:48 - 00:12:51] and then instructional support what
[00:12:51 - 00:12:53] is that covered so institutional
[00:12:53 - 00:12:54] support yeah institutional i'm sorry
[00:12:56 - 00:12:56] that is the administrative that
[00:12:56 - 00:12:58] is administrative offices that is
[00:12:58 - 00:13:03] uh payroll accounts payable vp
[00:13:03 - 00:13:05] all the all the supporting
[00:13:05 - 00:13:07] purchasing all and then academic
[00:13:07 - 00:13:10] support academic support is the
[00:13:10 - 00:13:10] labs the academic support is
[00:13:11 - 00:13:11] the labs the libraries libraries
[00:13:12 - 00:13:13] okay okay okay okay counseling
[00:13:13 - 00:13:16] counseling got it what is
[00:13:16 - 00:13:17] transfers what is transfers transfer
[00:13:17 - 00:13:19] transfer transfers are uh certain
[00:13:19 - 00:13:23] amounts set aside to be
[00:13:23 - 00:13:23] set to certain funds that
[00:13:25 - 00:13:25] support other activities for example
[00:13:28 - 00:13:28] the transfers uh we do
[00:13:28 - 00:13:31] a transfer for texas public
[00:13:31 - 00:13:31] education grant of 1 1
[00:13:34 - 00:13:34] million texas public education grant
[00:13:34 - 00:13:37] uh is mandated by law
[00:13:37 - 00:13:40] from the state so that
[00:13:40 - 00:13:40] is a mandatory transfer that's
[00:13:40 - 00:13:42] 1 1 million in addition
[00:13:42 - 00:13:45] we transfer another 1 3
[00:13:45 - 00:13:45] million to the plant fund
[00:13:47 - 00:13:47] for ongoing projects and then
[00:13:47 - 00:13:50] we transfer to the athletics
[00:13:50 - 00:13:54] program sport athletics and then
[00:13:54 - 00:13:57] student activities and then uh
[00:13:57 - 00:14:02] we we also we we
[00:14:02 - 00:14:02] also we also do a
[00:14:02 - 00:14:05] small transfer to student government
[00:14:16 - 00:14:16] so i'll go into more
[00:14:16 - 00:14:25] detail on the slide so
[00:14:25 - 00:14:25] this same budget now is
[00:14:25 - 00:14:31] organized by expense category so
[00:14:31 - 00:14:31] in here what you see
[00:14:31 - 00:14:32] is the largest so in
[00:14:32 - 00:14:33] here what you see is
[00:14:33 - 00:14:37] the largest portion portion is
[00:14:37 - 00:14:37] going to the staff and
[00:14:37 - 00:14:40] faculty salaries so over here
[00:14:40 - 00:14:43] on the right you see
[00:14:43 - 00:14:43] faculty salaries budgeted at 56
[00:14:44 - 00:14:47] 8 million 34 of the
[00:14:47 - 00:14:50] budget and then over here
[00:14:50 - 00:14:50] you see staff salaries at
[00:14:50 - 00:14:51] 50 here you see staff
[00:14:52 - 00:14:53] salaries at 50 million 3
[00:14:53 - 00:14:55] million 3 and then here
[00:14:55 - 00:14:55] you see benefits at 14
[00:14:55 - 00:14:59] 2 2 if you add
[00:14:59 - 00:15:03] those three categories that represents
[00:15:03 - 00:15:03] about 73 of the budget
[00:15:06 - 00:15:06] so that's probably the biggest
[00:15:06 - 00:15:09] takeaway from this this particular
[00:15:09 - 00:15:13] slide that most of the
[00:15:13 - 00:15:13] budget goes to staff and
[00:15:16 - 00:15:17] faculty salaries and benefits yes
[00:15:17 - 00:15:24] sir supplies and services is
[00:15:24 - 00:15:30] that where so we're going
[00:15:30 - 00:15:30] to pay a lot more
[00:15:30 - 00:15:31] for electricity you're going to
[00:15:31 - 00:15:32] put it in electricity you're
[00:15:33 - 00:15:37] going to put it in
[00:15:38 - 00:15:41] there so uh we talked
[00:15:41 - 00:15:45] about salaries and then uh
[00:15:45 - 00:15:45] we have contingency of 6
[00:15:45 - 00:15:49] 7 at the top that
[00:15:49 - 00:15:52] contains a bianium reserve largely
[00:15:52 - 00:15:52] in it um we talked
[00:15:52 - 00:15:55] about benefits supplies and services
[00:15:55 - 00:15:57] as as uh mr xer
[00:15:57 - 00:16:00] says that does include utilities
[00:16:00 - 00:16:02] it maintenance software those kind
[00:16:02 - 00:16:02] of things we talked about
[00:16:04 - 00:16:04] transfers and then smaller amount
[00:16:04 - 00:16:07] to travel 1 3 million
[00:16:07 - 00:16:09] and equipment 1 1 million
[00:16:09 - 00:16:10] in addition in the blocks
[00:16:12 - 00:16:14] underneath the salaries classification you
[00:16:14 - 00:16:14] see a breakdown between full-time
[00:16:18 - 00:16:18] and part-time in those categories
[00:16:18 - 00:16:21] as and part-time in those
[00:16:22 - 00:16:26] categories as well so now
[00:16:26 - 00:16:26] we look at how we're
[00:16:26 - 00:16:29] doing in the current year
[00:16:29 - 00:16:29] in the current year what
[00:16:32 - 00:16:32] this slide does it compares
[00:16:32 - 00:16:35] the adopted budget right here
[00:16:35 - 00:16:35] in 2425 this is the
[00:16:38 - 00:16:38] budget we're operating under and
[00:16:38 - 00:16:41] then the middle column what
[00:16:41 - 00:16:42] miss zuniga did is projected
[00:16:42 - 00:16:45] out what we're actually going
[00:16:45 - 00:16:45] to bring in and then
[00:16:45 - 00:16:47] we have a variance in
[00:16:47 - 00:16:47] a percentage compared to the
[00:16:50 - 00:16:50] adopted budget so as we
[00:16:50 - 00:16:53] can see on the state
[00:16:53 - 00:16:53] appropriations line item we have
[00:16:58 - 00:16:58] a variance of 4 7
[00:16:58 - 00:16:58] million to the good up
[00:17:00 - 00:17:02] uh 107 that is that
[00:17:02 - 00:17:02] is because of a dynamic
[00:17:05 - 00:17:05] adjustment the college uh received
[00:17:05 - 00:17:07] from the state we received
[00:17:07 - 00:17:10] additional funding because of performance
[00:17:10 - 00:17:12] outcomes that were reported can
[00:17:12 - 00:17:17] you please repeat that for
[00:17:17 - 00:17:19] the judge to hear i
[00:17:19 - 00:17:21] heard that wait till you
[00:17:21 - 00:17:21] hear how much we're going
[00:17:22 - 00:17:24] to get this year is
[00:17:24 - 00:17:24] that the 48 is the
[00:17:24 - 00:17:27] number you can't your best
[00:17:27 - 00:17:27] yet i mean you got
[00:17:27 - 00:17:28] last night is that it
[00:17:29 - 00:17:29] no no this is the
[00:17:29 - 00:17:32] current year mr xer and
[00:17:32 - 00:17:32] so it's a dynamic formula
[00:17:32 - 00:17:34] now with house bill 8
[00:17:34 - 00:17:36] with the capacity of house
[00:17:36 - 00:17:37] bill 8 and so they
[00:17:37 - 00:17:40] fund us based on projections
[00:17:40 - 00:17:40] uh when our actual outcomes
[00:17:43 - 00:17:43] came to fruition uh and
[00:17:43 - 00:17:45] we certified those with the
[00:17:45 - 00:17:48] coordinating board um the funding
[00:17:48 - 00:17:48] level was increased um about
[00:17:50 - 00:17:50] 4 7 million based on
[00:17:50 - 00:17:53] our actual outcomes so that's
[00:17:53 - 00:18:01] all the fact so um
[00:18:01 - 00:18:01] the projected revenue is higher
[00:18:04 - 00:18:04] than the adopted budget revenue
[00:18:04 - 00:18:04] uh than the adopted budget
[00:18:05 - 00:18:05] revenue uh 10 71 10
[00:18:05 - 00:18:08] 71 the next item overhead
[00:18:08 - 00:18:10] recovery we're we're expecting a
[00:18:10 - 00:18:12] small decline we're adjusting that
[00:18:12 - 00:18:12] number as we do the
[00:18:14 - 00:18:14] budget development that is the
[00:18:14 - 00:18:18] overhead recovery from grants and
[00:18:18 - 00:18:20] contracts um so a very
[00:18:20 - 00:18:23] small decrease there under local
[00:18:23 - 00:18:23] funds the tuition and fees
[00:18:23 - 00:18:29] line item uh comparing the
[00:18:29 - 00:18:32] adopted uh revenue budget of
[00:18:32 - 00:18:32] 39 1 compared to the
[00:18:35 - 00:18:37] projection of 42 5 we
[00:18:37 - 00:18:37] have a positive variance of
[00:18:37 - 00:18:39] 3 4 million on the
[00:18:39 - 00:18:39] tuition and fees that is
[00:18:41 - 00:18:41] because of the gradual increase
[00:18:41 - 00:18:42] in because of the gradual
[00:18:42 - 00:18:46] increase in enrollment enrollment um
[00:18:46 - 00:18:46] that is occurring uh incidentally
[00:18:48 - 00:18:48] we ran a report yesterday
[00:18:48 - 00:18:50] and summer is up 12
[00:18:53 - 00:18:53] still holding at 12 up
[00:18:53 - 00:18:57] which is very good uh
[00:18:57 - 00:18:57] the fall uh at the
[00:18:57 - 00:19:00] moment very preliminarily is up
[00:19:00 - 00:19:02] as well um so tuition
[00:19:02 - 00:19:02] and fees that has a
[00:19:02 - 00:19:06] a positive variance of 8
[00:19:06 - 00:19:09] 7 property tax revenue is
[00:19:09 - 00:19:09] projected to be property tax
[00:19:09 - 00:19:10] revenue is projected to be
[00:19:10 - 00:19:15] 75 8 75 8 million
[00:19:15 - 00:19:15] uh positive variance of 2
[00:19:15 - 00:19:18] 7 um what what happens
[00:19:18 - 00:19:19] on property tax revenue when
[00:19:19 - 00:19:19] we budget for that we
[00:19:21 - 00:19:26] budget very conservatively the the
[00:19:26 - 00:19:31] tax office discounts the values
[00:19:31 - 00:19:32] by 2 8 8 certified
[00:19:32 - 00:19:32] values that they give the
[00:19:37 - 00:19:37] college are lower by 2
[00:19:37 - 00:19:40] 8 of what the valuations
[00:19:40 - 00:19:42] are so the number that
[00:19:42 - 00:19:42] we book is a conservative
[00:19:44 - 00:19:44] number and that's provided to
[00:19:44 - 00:19:46] all the governmental entities in
[00:19:46 - 00:19:46] el paso the governmental entities
[00:19:47 - 00:19:48] in el paso the 2
[00:19:48 - 00:19:50] 8 2 8 uh because
[00:19:50 - 00:19:53] they might have some lawsuits
[00:19:53 - 00:19:53] that are occurring uh re
[00:19:53 - 00:19:55] large refunds that may happen
[00:19:55 - 00:19:57] and they don't want it
[00:19:57 - 00:19:57] to hit the taxing the
[00:19:57 - 00:20:01] entities all at once so
[00:20:01 - 00:20:01] it's a very good uh
[00:20:02 - 00:20:03] it's a very good thing
[00:20:03 - 00:20:03] that they do on our
[00:20:06 - 00:20:06] behalf so because of that
[00:20:06 - 00:20:09] practice where they certified lower
[00:20:09 - 00:20:11] values to us um you
[00:20:11 - 00:20:11] can see the outcome that
[00:20:11 - 00:20:13] we're projecting we're going to
[00:20:13 - 00:20:16] bring in 2 7 more
[00:20:16 - 00:20:16] than we budgeted so that's
[00:20:16 - 00:20:22] the result of that and
[00:20:22 - 00:20:22] then we have other income
[00:20:22 - 00:20:25] that has a positive variance
[00:20:25 - 00:20:26] of 4 4 million the
[00:20:28 - 00:20:28] other income the the big
[00:20:28 - 00:20:32] item in there is interest
[00:20:32 - 00:20:35] income we budgeted very conservatively
[00:20:35 - 00:20:35] at five 5 million for
[00:20:38 - 00:20:38] the year but our but
[00:20:38 - 00:20:41] our interest income is about
[00:20:41 - 00:20:41] 9 million so far we've
[00:20:43 - 00:20:43] already we we already almost
[00:20:43 - 00:20:45] doubled the budget but the
[00:20:45 - 00:20:47] reason we don't budget that
[00:20:47 - 00:20:47] higher is because interest income
[00:20:51 - 00:20:51] is very volatile and so
[00:20:51 - 00:20:54] it's not a good uh
[00:20:54 - 00:20:54] item to build a sustainable
[00:20:54 - 00:20:54] budget uh item to build
[00:20:55 - 00:20:55] a sustainable budget on on
[00:20:58 - 00:20:58] if you budget too high
[00:20:58 - 00:21:00] and the interest rates go
[00:21:00 - 00:21:00] in the tank then that's
[00:21:00 - 00:21:02] not a very sustainable budget
[00:21:02 - 00:21:04] so consequently we budget conservatively
[00:21:07 - 00:21:07] for interest and this is
[00:21:07 - 00:21:08] a result of for interest
[00:21:08 - 00:21:09] and this is a result
[00:21:09 - 00:21:13] of that that so when
[00:21:13 - 00:21:13] we look at that subtotal
[00:21:13 - 00:21:17] there we are we are
[00:21:17 - 00:21:20] looking at a positive variance
[00:21:20 - 00:21:20] of 10 6 6 million
[00:21:20 - 00:21:23] for the current year up
[00:21:23 - 00:21:23] to this point up through
[00:21:26 - 00:21:26] local funds and then we
[00:21:26 - 00:21:28] look at self-supporting projected revenues
[00:21:28 - 00:21:31] are going to be 1
[00:21:31 - 00:21:33] 584 that doesn't mean we're
[00:21:33 - 00:21:35] going to have a deficit
[00:21:35 - 00:21:38] this is only projected revenues
[00:21:38 - 00:21:38] in a while we'll look
[00:21:38 - 00:21:45] at projected expenditures self-supporting accounts
[00:21:45 - 00:21:49] by definition break even the
[00:21:49 - 00:21:49] the expenditures should not exceed
[00:21:53 - 00:21:53] revenues so on this revenue
[00:21:53 - 00:21:54] chart uh when you compare
[00:21:54 - 00:21:54] the budget of 3 million
[00:21:56 - 00:21:56] for self-supporting compared to the
[00:21:58 - 00:21:58] projection it's a decrease of
[00:21:58 - 00:22:01] 1 4 million all that
[00:22:01 - 00:22:01] that means is that we
[00:22:04 - 00:22:04] didn't have uh 3 million
[00:22:04 - 00:22:10] of self-supporting accounts active uh
[00:22:10 - 00:22:10] within the college so overall
[00:22:10 - 00:22:11] what you see here the
[00:22:11 - 00:22:16] takeaway from this slide is
[00:22:16 - 00:22:20] that we're projecting 180 we're
[00:22:20 - 00:22:24] projecting 180 million in projected
[00:22:24 - 00:22:25] revenue compared to the revenues
[00:22:25 - 00:22:26] projected in the adopted budget
[00:22:29 - 00:22:29] of 166 is an overall
[00:22:29 - 00:22:32] positive variance of 13 8
[00:22:32 - 00:22:34] million 8 3 and and
[00:22:34 - 00:22:34] when when do we close
[00:22:34 - 00:22:39] this uh august 31st august
[00:22:39 - 00:22:42] 31st so uh we got
[00:22:42 - 00:22:42] three months looking good almost
[00:22:44 - 00:22:44] 14 million for three months
[00:22:44 - 00:22:46] next three 14 million for
[00:22:46 - 00:22:49] three months next three months
[00:22:51 - 00:22:51] so you're going to see
[00:22:51 - 00:22:55] you're going to see the
[00:22:55 - 00:22:55] 180 million on the next
[00:22:55 - 00:22:58] slide it's going to carry
[00:22:58 - 00:22:58] over to uh the the
[00:23:00 - 00:23:00] budget status slide so i'm
[00:23:02 - 00:23:02] we're fairly confident in 180
[00:23:10 - 00:23:10] so this is the budget
[00:23:10 - 00:23:14] status slide this combines what
[00:23:14 - 00:23:17] we are projecting as revenue
[00:23:17 - 00:23:17] up here the 180 80
[00:23:17 - 00:23:19] million from the previous slide
[00:23:19 - 00:23:21] we're projecting that and then
[00:23:21 - 00:23:25] so we did a projection
[00:23:25 - 00:23:25] on what we think expenditures
[00:23:27 - 00:23:27] are going to come up
[00:23:27 - 00:23:30] to so we project expenditures
[00:23:30 - 00:23:31] at 145 7 expenditures at
[00:23:31 - 00:23:35] 145 7 million million that's
[00:23:35 - 00:23:35] what we project out um
[00:23:35 - 00:23:40] so that's going to result
[00:23:40 - 00:23:45] in a surplus of 34
[00:23:45 - 00:23:45] 5 million as we project
[00:23:45 - 00:23:47] here as of the end
[00:23:47 - 00:23:50] of may now what you
[00:23:50 - 00:23:50] see here is we adopted
[00:23:50 - 00:23:56] a budget uh revenues of
[00:23:56 - 00:23:58] 166 we have 180 uh
[00:23:58 - 00:23:58] million coming in so we
[00:23:58 - 00:24:01] exceeded the budget by 13
[00:24:01 - 00:24:03] 8 million that's a part
[00:24:03 - 00:24:03] of why we have a
[00:24:03 - 00:24:07] surplus and then on the
[00:24:07 - 00:24:07] expense side we have uh
[00:24:07 - 00:24:09] we're under the expenditure budget
[00:24:09 - 00:24:12] by about 20 million those
[00:24:12 - 00:24:15] two together result in the
[00:24:15 - 00:24:15] surplus that we're projecting of
[00:24:19 - 00:24:19] 34 5 million and that
[00:24:19 - 00:24:23] will uh be used for
[00:24:23 - 00:24:23] fund balance to maintain a
[00:24:23 - 00:24:25] 25 uh ratio of fund
[00:24:25 - 00:24:28] balance to operating budget and
[00:24:28 - 00:24:28] then also uh for sax
[00:24:30 - 00:24:30] accredititation purposes they like to
[00:24:32 - 00:24:32] look at a healthy fund
[00:24:32 - 00:24:36] balance so these kind of
[00:24:36 - 00:24:36] results uh result in good
[00:24:38 - 00:24:38] reviews by sachs and also
[00:24:38 - 00:24:40] the rating agencies look at
[00:24:40 - 00:24:42] your performance how did you
[00:24:42 - 00:24:42] all do how are you
[00:24:42 - 00:24:44] managing the budget how are
[00:24:44 - 00:24:44] how are you how are
[00:24:44 - 00:24:46] your numbers coming up how
[00:24:46 - 00:24:50] are your estimates holding up
[00:24:50 - 00:24:54] uh so surpluses are um
[00:24:54 - 00:24:57] very beneficiary ultimately after we
[00:24:57 - 00:24:57] hit the 25 fund balance
[00:24:57 - 00:24:59] using some of this there's
[00:24:59 - 00:25:02] still going to be an
[00:25:02 - 00:25:02] amount left over that we're
[00:25:02 - 00:25:05] going to move to the
[00:25:05 - 00:25:08] project reserve for capital projects
[00:25:08 - 00:25:11] those capital projects will address
[00:25:11 - 00:25:13] deferred maintenance and any capital
[00:25:13 - 00:25:15] projects for renovations anything related
[00:25:15 - 00:25:17] to buildings and grounds those
[00:25:17 - 00:25:17] kind of things and as
[00:25:19 - 00:25:19] usual like most entities we
[00:25:19 - 00:25:20] have more need than we
[00:25:20 - 00:25:20] have money so this is
[00:25:27 - 00:25:27] are there any questions on
[00:25:27 - 00:25:31] the slide could you um
[00:25:31 - 00:25:31] go over the overhead um
[00:25:34 - 00:25:34] i know that variance i
[00:25:34 - 00:25:34] know that variance sure sure
[00:25:37 - 00:25:37] and how we reduce that
[00:25:37 - 00:25:39] or i know you mentioned
[00:25:39 - 00:25:42] contracts right here yes that
[00:25:42 - 00:25:42] overhead recovery and how we
[00:25:44 - 00:25:46] reduced that amount sure so
[00:25:46 - 00:25:47] when we're estimating what we're
[00:25:47 - 00:25:47] going to bring in on
[00:25:47 - 00:25:49] over recovery we look at
[00:25:49 - 00:25:52] all the all the contracts
[00:25:52 - 00:25:52] that the college has with
[00:25:55 - 00:25:55] federal agencies state agencies local
[00:25:57 - 00:25:57] agencies some of those contracts
[00:25:58 - 00:26:00] allow for us to recoup
[00:26:00 - 00:26:03] administrative cost that's the called
[00:26:03 - 00:26:06] the overhead recovery rate so
[00:26:06 - 00:26:06] for example uh the national
[00:26:09 - 00:26:09] science foundation uh allows us
[00:26:09 - 00:26:13] to recoup 15 of personnel
[00:26:13 - 00:26:15] and benefit cost in the
[00:26:15 - 00:26:16] contract so we estimate what
[00:26:18 - 00:26:18] that number is going to
[00:26:18 - 00:26:21] gen generate and that is
[00:26:21 - 00:26:21] overhead recovery for that one
[00:26:23 - 00:26:23] example i have but some
[00:26:23 - 00:26:25] of the contracts allow for
[00:26:25 - 00:26:29] overhead recovery some of them
[00:26:29 - 00:26:29] do not uh one of
[00:26:29 - 00:26:31] the items of contention this
[00:26:31 - 00:26:34] year with the federal government
[00:26:34 - 00:26:34] is that they are proposing
[00:26:34 - 00:26:38] uh for the national science
[00:26:38 - 00:26:40] foundation that um which was
[00:26:40 - 00:26:42] previously uncapped you could charge
[00:26:42 - 00:26:45] them uh your internal indirect
[00:26:45 - 00:26:47] cost recovery rate the colleg's
[00:26:47 - 00:26:51] indirect cost recovery rate is
[00:26:51 - 00:26:53] 41 that's very nice so
[00:26:53 - 00:26:55] when you see an uncapped
[00:26:55 - 00:26:55] grant you say hey we're
[00:26:57 - 00:26:57] going to recoup 41 to
[00:26:57 - 00:27:01] pay ourselves back for having
[00:27:01 - 00:27:03] staff support that theirs is
[00:27:03 - 00:27:03] getting lowered to 15 that's
[00:27:07 - 00:27:07] a result of what's happening
[00:27:10 - 00:27:10] in the federal world so
[00:27:10 - 00:27:14] far that's the only one
[00:27:14 - 00:27:14] on the recovery that's being
[00:27:17 - 00:27:17] impacted so this this decrease
[00:27:17 - 00:27:20] here this movie uh shows
[00:27:20 - 00:27:22] less activity that we're having
[00:27:22 - 00:27:23] in the grants okay thank
[00:27:23 - 00:27:28] you you're welcome are there
[00:27:28 - 00:27:28] any other questions on this
[00:27:28 - 00:27:28] are there any other questions
[00:27:28 - 00:27:29] on this slide slide i
[00:27:29 - 00:27:34] do yes sir do we
[00:27:34 - 00:27:34] carry uh vacancies at 10
[00:27:36 - 00:27:41] million a year so um
[00:27:41 - 00:27:41] right now that's the value
[00:27:41 - 00:27:43] of vacancies as of may
[00:27:43 - 00:27:45] that number is going to
[00:27:45 - 00:27:46] grow going to grow yeah
[00:27:46 - 00:27:48] yeah that number is going
[00:27:48 - 00:27:51] to grow as people leave
[00:27:51 - 00:27:51] the college um and and
[00:27:51 - 00:27:53] we may not be recruiting
[00:27:53 - 00:27:53] or it's taking us a
[00:27:54 - 00:27:59] while to find somebody that
[00:27:59 - 00:27:59] contributes to that vacancy number
[00:28:02 - 00:28:02] so vacancies are the result
[00:28:02 - 00:28:05] of you know turnover and
[00:28:05 - 00:28:05] so that number is the
[00:28:07 - 00:28:07] dollar value of the vacant
[00:28:08 - 00:28:11] positions that we have but
[00:28:11 - 00:28:11] it's also the vacancies that
[00:28:11 - 00:28:14] we have filled the year
[00:28:14 - 00:28:17] right some some some take
[00:28:17 - 00:28:19] years judge some are are
[00:28:19 - 00:28:19] within this fiscal year some
[00:28:19 - 00:28:22] are within this last couple
[00:28:22 - 00:28:24] of months um so it's
[00:28:24 - 00:28:24] it's a variety of all
[00:28:24 - 00:28:27] of those respective areas i've
[00:28:27 - 00:28:29] um let the vice presidents
[00:28:29 - 00:28:29] know that they have full
[00:28:31 - 00:28:31] control of their respective budgets
[00:28:31 - 00:28:33] if they have vacancies and
[00:28:33 - 00:28:36] they they need to merge
[00:28:36 - 00:28:36] positions to create a higher
[00:28:39 - 00:28:39] level position um they need
[00:28:39 - 00:28:42] to add resources to specific
[00:28:42 - 00:28:43] positions that they have full
[00:28:43 - 00:28:46] authority within their respective areas
[00:28:46 - 00:28:48] to use these vacancies in
[00:28:48 - 00:28:48] the way that they see
[00:28:48 - 00:28:50] fit they obviously bring those
[00:28:50 - 00:28:50] to me and then i
[00:28:54 - 00:28:54] approve them um but um
[00:28:54 - 00:28:57] this is a little larger
[00:28:57 - 00:28:57] than our normal vacancy rate
[00:28:57 - 00:28:59] um i i want to
[00:28:59 - 00:28:59] say last year at this
[00:28:59 - 00:29:02] time we were probably in
[00:29:02 - 00:29:06] the 7 to8 million range
[00:29:06 - 00:29:06] um but we we're never
[00:29:06 - 00:29:06] staffed at range um but
[00:29:06 - 00:29:08] we we're never staffed at
[00:29:08 - 00:29:10] 100 100 so so um
[00:29:10 - 00:29:10] if you look at the
[00:29:10 - 00:29:13] complete budget it's 166 million
[00:29:13 - 00:29:16] and approximately 75 of the
[00:29:16 - 00:29:18] budget are salaries and benefits
[00:29:19 - 00:29:21] 121 million yeah so that's
[00:29:21 - 00:29:24] that is what you're looking
[00:29:24 - 00:29:24] at it's roughly um a
[00:29:24 - 00:29:28] little less than 10 10
[00:29:28 - 00:29:28] is that is that normal
[00:29:28 - 00:29:33] for most colleges or to
[00:29:33 - 00:29:33] be at about 90 um
[00:29:33 - 00:29:33] i i only have a
[00:29:36 - 00:29:36] couple of college experience um
[00:29:36 - 00:29:39] but i would say that
[00:29:39 - 00:29:39] in the 90 to 93
[00:29:39 - 00:29:41] is is about the normal
[00:29:41 - 00:29:43] range for for higher ed
[00:29:43 - 00:29:43] and for community for for
[00:29:44 - 00:29:45] higher ed and for community
[00:29:45 - 00:30:04] colleges colleges so moving ahead
[00:30:04 - 00:30:04] to the planning for next
[00:30:07 - 00:30:09] year's budget uh for 2526
[00:30:14 - 00:30:14] the 89th legislature has met
[00:30:14 - 00:30:17] and so as a result
[00:30:17 - 00:30:17] of that uh they determine
[00:30:17 - 00:30:22] our near final run appropriation
[00:30:22 - 00:30:24] amount and so uh that's
[00:30:24 - 00:30:28] based upon on performance measure
[00:30:28 - 00:30:30] outcomes and uh they talked
[00:30:30 - 00:30:30] about payment methods and refined
[00:30:33 - 00:30:33] this during the current bienium
[00:30:33 - 00:30:37] that has happened also uh
[00:30:37 - 00:30:37] the the state uh house
[00:30:39 - 00:30:41] bill 500 increased the funding
[00:30:41 - 00:30:44] for community colleges by 89
[00:30:44 - 00:30:46] 5 colleges by 89 5
[00:30:46 - 00:30:48] million million uh that was
[00:30:48 - 00:30:52] because community college colleges outperformed
[00:30:52 - 00:30:55] the forecast that the coordinating
[00:30:55 - 00:30:55] board did so those two
[00:30:57 - 00:30:57] things have happened uh the
[00:30:57 - 00:31:00] tuition and fees that we
[00:31:00 - 00:31:00] are going to project for
[00:31:02 - 00:31:02] next year are based upon
[00:31:02 - 00:31:05] the tuition rate schedule effective
[00:31:05 - 00:31:07] for this fall we have
[00:31:07 - 00:31:07] not raised tuition since fall
[00:31:07 - 00:31:08] of we have not raised
[00:31:08 - 00:31:09] tuition since fall of 2020
[00:31:09 - 00:31:12] 2020 so that is still
[00:31:12 - 00:31:15] the same tuition rate and
[00:31:15 - 00:31:15] it's also based upon current
[00:31:15 - 00:31:15] year and it's also based
[00:31:15 - 00:31:16] upon current year enrollment enrollment
[00:31:18 - 00:31:18] i mentioned to you that
[00:31:18 - 00:31:20] summer is trending higher but
[00:31:20 - 00:31:24] we're budgeting very conservatively at
[00:31:24 - 00:31:26] at the enrollment uh for
[00:31:26 - 00:31:26] this year even if it's
[00:31:28 - 00:31:28] projecting higher we not until
[00:31:28 - 00:31:30] we see that number not
[00:31:30 - 00:31:30] until we see the dust
[00:31:34 - 00:31:34] settle do we um budget
[00:31:34 - 00:31:37] the increased amount so we're
[00:31:37 - 00:31:39] budgeting flat the current year's
[00:31:39 - 00:31:47] enrollment and there's property taxes
[00:31:47 - 00:31:51] based upon a preliminary taxable
[00:31:51 - 00:31:51] property valuation of 76 or
[00:31:51 - 00:31:52] 77 taxable property valuation of
[00:31:52 - 00:31:53] 76 or 77 billion billion
[00:31:57 - 00:31:57] um and new property at
[00:31:57 - 00:32:01] 1 6 billion and a
[00:32:01 - 00:32:01] preliminary no new revenue rate
[00:32:01 - 00:32:01] of and a preliminary no
[00:32:02 - 00:32:02] new revenue rate of 09839
[00:32:02 - 00:32:05] 09839 cents per 100 valuation
[00:32:05 - 00:32:05] this is a very cents
[00:32:06 - 00:32:07] per 100 valuation this is
[00:32:07 - 00:32:12] a very preliminary preliminary number
[00:32:12 - 00:32:12] uh these numbers will change
[00:32:12 - 00:32:15] uh the the city sends
[00:32:15 - 00:32:18] us reports once a month
[00:32:18 - 00:32:18] this is going to change
[00:32:18 - 00:32:21] it is going the rate
[00:32:21 - 00:32:21] is going to go up
[00:32:21 - 00:32:23] and the valuation is going
[00:32:23 - 00:32:26] to go down people protest
[00:32:26 - 00:32:26] and those kind of things
[00:32:26 - 00:32:29] happen so that's going to
[00:32:29 - 00:32:31] reduce the the valuation and
[00:32:31 - 00:32:31] it's going to drive our
[00:32:34 - 00:32:34] rate a little bit higher
[00:32:34 - 00:32:35] typically that rate will change
[00:32:35 - 00:32:35] by about three or four
[00:32:37 - 00:32:37] percent it'll probably go over
[00:32:39 - 00:32:39] just a little over 10
[00:32:41 - 00:32:43] yeah 10 1 probably but
[00:32:43 - 00:32:43] still the nice trend for
[00:32:43 - 00:32:46] the college if you look
[00:32:46 - 00:32:46] at a 5-year trend in
[00:32:46 - 00:32:49] 2020 we were at 14
[00:32:49 - 00:32:53] cents per 100 valuation we're
[00:32:53 - 00:32:53] capped at 15 cents we're
[00:32:53 - 00:32:55] cap we're close to our
[00:32:55 - 00:32:55] cap so as a result
[00:32:59 - 00:32:59] of uh valuations continuing to
[00:32:59 - 00:33:01] go up uh that's driving
[00:33:01 - 00:33:01] our no new revenue rate
[00:33:04 - 00:33:04] down which is good because
[00:33:04 - 00:33:07] should the college need taxing
[00:33:07 - 00:33:10] capacity we would have it
[00:33:10 - 00:33:10] in case of an emergency
[00:33:10 - 00:33:13] like but we had to
[00:33:13 - 00:33:13] hire like 40 faculty several
[00:33:18 - 00:33:18] years ago raised taxes in
[00:33:18 - 00:33:22] 1819 4 uh to hire
[00:33:22 - 00:33:22] faculty we had we had
[00:33:22 - 00:33:24] the the gunpowder to do
[00:33:24 - 00:33:26] that this creat creates a
[00:33:26 - 00:33:26] lot of capacity for the
[00:33:26 - 00:33:29] district yes sir we benefited
[00:33:29 - 00:33:29] last year by a tremendous
[00:33:31 - 00:33:31] increase in property valuations increase
[00:33:32 - 00:33:32] in property valuations correct correct
[00:33:32 - 00:33:35] yes sir okay what does
[00:33:35 - 00:33:35] it look like for the
[00:33:37 - 00:33:37] next year does it look
[00:33:37 - 00:33:40] like we're going to hold
[00:33:40 - 00:33:40] property valuation same does it
[00:33:44 - 00:33:44] look like refunds will lower
[00:33:44 - 00:33:45] it are we looking for
[00:33:45 - 00:33:48] another big increase what is
[00:33:48 - 00:33:48] property valuation we meet we
[00:33:48 - 00:33:50] meet with the central physial
[00:33:50 - 00:33:53] district uh d kilgore and
[00:33:53 - 00:33:53] her team and we get
[00:33:53 - 00:33:56] updates on uh what is
[00:33:56 - 00:33:56] happening uh there's a lot
[00:33:59 - 00:33:59] of building going on in
[00:33:59 - 00:34:03] el paso uh so that
[00:34:03 - 00:34:03] is uh that that is
[00:34:03 - 00:34:05] projecting very well for property
[00:34:05 - 00:34:09] valuations to go up so
[00:34:09 - 00:34:09] we also um have have
[00:34:09 - 00:34:12] come to learn that over
[00:34:12 - 00:34:12] these past few years they've
[00:34:15 - 00:34:15] been uh re-evaluation years in
[00:34:15 - 00:34:18] other words uh traditionally the
[00:34:18 - 00:34:21] cad uh has not reevaluated
[00:34:21 - 00:34:25] residential property but once every
[00:34:25 - 00:34:27] three years now they're every
[00:34:27 - 00:34:30] year so the best guess
[00:34:30 - 00:34:30] is the net value of
[00:34:33 - 00:34:33] the property will go up
[00:34:33 - 00:34:35] i mean all the activity
[00:34:35 - 00:34:36] up and funds and all
[00:34:36 - 00:34:37] the all the buildings yeah
[00:34:37 - 00:34:37] you think you think it'll
[00:34:37 - 00:34:41] go up like what maybe
[00:34:41 - 00:34:41] 1 i mean i know
[00:34:41 - 00:34:45] it's swipes we we have
[00:34:45 - 00:34:48] been trending about um adding
[00:34:48 - 00:34:48] about 6 billion per year
[00:34:48 - 00:34:52] to the valuation um almost
[00:34:52 - 00:34:54] 10 close to 10 close
[00:34:54 - 00:34:55] to 10 yeah yeah yeah
[00:34:55 - 00:34:59] okay okay my my my
[00:34:59 - 00:35:02] home went up 41 so
[00:35:02 - 00:35:02] and i didn't do anything
[00:35:02 - 00:35:02] to the so and i
[00:35:03 - 00:35:04] didn't do anything to the
[00:35:04 - 00:35:05] house house as my wife
[00:35:05 - 00:35:07] would tell you i feel
[00:35:07 - 00:35:09] you i feel you yes
[00:35:09 - 00:35:11] yes so last year our
[00:35:11 - 00:35:14] valuations were 68 billion now
[00:35:14 - 00:35:14] we're at 75 the year
[00:35:14 - 00:35:17] prior to that we were
[00:35:17 - 00:35:19] at 61 billion the year
[00:35:19 - 00:35:19] prior to that we're at
[00:35:19 - 00:35:22] 55 so we're doing about
[00:35:22 - 00:35:23] 67 billion the last three
[00:35:23 - 00:35:25] years between 8 and 10
[00:35:26 - 00:35:33] instruction now that we keep
[00:35:33 - 00:35:33] getting the same no new
[00:35:35 - 00:35:35] revenues so our essentially tax
[00:35:35 - 00:35:39] rate goes down right here
[00:35:41 - 00:35:41] that's correct so the no
[00:35:41 - 00:35:44] new revenue rate um adjusts
[00:35:44 - 00:35:46] and we're only entitled to
[00:35:46 - 00:35:46] receive the same amount of
[00:35:46 - 00:35:48] revenue we received last year
[00:35:48 - 00:35:50] but that doesn't take into
[00:35:50 - 00:35:50] account the new property and
[00:35:53 - 00:35:53] so as a result we
[00:35:53 - 00:35:56] see um mr flores and
[00:35:56 - 00:35:56] his team normally budget for
[00:35:56 - 00:35:58] about a million more dollars
[00:35:58 - 00:35:58] in revenue from tax million
[00:35:59 - 00:36:00] more dollars in revenue from
[00:36:00 - 00:36:03] tax annually annually but we
[00:36:03 - 00:36:03] have we have the option
[00:36:03 - 00:36:05] as a board as an
[00:36:05 - 00:36:09] institution that we could then
[00:36:09 - 00:36:09] change our own tax rate
[00:36:09 - 00:36:11] ourselves that's correct i mean
[00:36:11 - 00:36:13] up to 8 yeah if
[00:36:13 - 00:36:13] if you choose to increase
[00:36:13 - 00:36:15] it if you choose to
[00:36:15 - 00:36:18] lower it there's no percentage
[00:36:18 - 00:36:18] but if the board chooses
[00:36:18 - 00:36:19] to increase our tax rate
[00:36:19 - 00:36:20] we can go up to
[00:36:23 - 00:36:23] 8 without a um election
[00:36:23 - 00:36:24] if you go beyond eight
[00:36:24 - 00:36:25] we have we're not precluded
[00:36:25 - 00:36:26] from we're not precluded from
[00:36:26 - 00:36:28] okay okay we're not that
[00:36:28 - 00:36:32] that's um legislation was passed
[00:36:32 - 00:36:34] in the uh 2021 session
[00:36:34 - 00:36:37] that restricted school districts cities
[00:36:37 - 00:36:42] counties um to they went
[00:36:42 - 00:36:42] from 8 to 4 um
[00:36:42 - 00:36:43] we we worked hard at
[00:36:43 - 00:36:43] the state level that community
[00:36:45 - 00:36:45] colleges were not included in
[00:36:45 - 00:36:48] that so our rate has
[00:36:48 - 00:36:48] remained at 8 despite us
[00:36:52 - 00:36:52] only doing that twice in
[00:36:52 - 00:37:01] the last 25 so another
[00:37:01 - 00:37:01] factor um so some of
[00:37:01 - 00:37:03] the other factors in the
[00:37:03 - 00:37:05] strategic planning for the budget
[00:37:05 - 00:37:07] development process there's going to
[00:37:07 - 00:37:09] be discussion consideration for a
[00:37:09 - 00:37:13] salary enhancement for employees and
[00:37:13 - 00:37:13] then as we've mentioned earlier
[00:37:14 - 00:37:16] uh additional funding requests that
[00:37:16 - 00:37:18] have been submitted by the
[00:37:18 - 00:37:21] executive level that are going
[00:37:21 - 00:37:23] to be evaluated for consideration
[00:37:23 - 00:37:26] into the budget and then
[00:37:26 - 00:37:26] the last two bullets uh
[00:37:26 - 00:37:29] continued impact of gaz 68
[00:37:29 - 00:37:33] and 75 on unrestricted net
[00:37:33 - 00:37:36] position so those are amounts
[00:37:36 - 00:37:36] are unpredictable to us uh
[00:37:41 - 00:37:41] so uh we we get
[00:37:41 - 00:37:41] a hit of between one
[00:37:41 - 00:37:44] and 6 million to our
[00:37:44 - 00:37:47] fund balance every year so
[00:37:47 - 00:37:47] we don't budget for that
[00:37:47 - 00:37:49] but as you saw by
[00:37:49 - 00:37:49] the budget surplus on the
[00:37:52 - 00:37:52] budget status slide previously uh
[00:37:52 - 00:37:56] that's absorbed into any uh
[00:37:56 - 00:37:59] surplus that the college might
[00:37:59 - 00:38:01] be realizing so there will
[00:38:01 - 00:38:01] be impact from the gazsbies
[00:38:01 - 00:38:02] we don't find that out
[00:38:02 - 00:38:05] till about october when we're
[00:38:05 - 00:38:05] closing our books and then
[00:38:05 - 00:38:07] we come back and book
[00:38:07 - 00:38:07] it uh so we don't
[00:38:07 - 00:38:10] we don't know what that
[00:38:10 - 00:38:12] is that's we're dependent on
[00:38:12 - 00:38:12] the state giving us that
[00:38:16 - 00:38:20] information to book um the
[00:38:20 - 00:38:20] last item um there's another
[00:38:20 - 00:38:24] new gazsby uh 101 on
[00:38:24 - 00:38:26] compensated absences that we're going
[00:38:26 - 00:38:26] to have to implement uh
[00:38:31 - 00:38:31] this year and so uh
[00:38:31 - 00:38:33] we expect an impact of
[00:38:33 - 00:38:34] about 200 000 for that
[00:38:36 - 00:38:39] and what's that cover so
[00:38:39 - 00:38:39] gazsby 101 is being changed
[00:38:40 - 00:38:43] gatsby 101 or gazsby uncompensated
[00:38:43 - 00:38:45] absences says that you have
[00:38:45 - 00:38:47] to book a liability on
[00:38:47 - 00:38:55] august 31st for everything that
[00:38:55 - 00:38:55] you owe in vacation and
[00:38:55 - 00:38:59] sickness so for many years
[00:38:59 - 00:38:59] we've been booking the so
[00:38:59 - 00:39:00] for many years we've been
[00:39:00 - 00:39:03] booking the vacation vacation balance
[00:39:03 - 00:39:05] that's owed to employees converting
[00:39:05 - 00:39:05] that to a dollar value
[00:39:05 - 00:39:07] and then we pay off
[00:39:07 - 00:39:07] 10 of the sick leave
[00:39:10 - 00:39:10] balances that has a dollar
[00:39:10 - 00:39:13] value so we book a
[00:39:13 - 00:39:13] liability of about 4 3
[00:39:13 - 00:39:15] million and so whenever we
[00:39:15 - 00:39:18] book a liability as an
[00:39:18 - 00:39:18] offset to an expense so
[00:39:18 - 00:39:21] we've been carrying that in
[00:39:21 - 00:39:22] our books now uh the
[00:39:24 - 00:39:24] so gatsby's come back and
[00:39:24 - 00:39:26] said not only do you
[00:39:26 - 00:39:26] have to book that but
[00:39:26 - 00:39:28] you have to project out
[00:39:28 - 00:39:30] what people are going to
[00:39:30 - 00:39:30] use in the coming year
[00:39:30 - 00:39:32] so we're going to have
[00:39:32 - 00:39:34] to we're going to have
[00:39:34 - 00:39:34] to go through hoops to
[00:39:34 - 00:39:37] estimate that like a 10page
[00:39:37 - 00:39:38] report that tells you how
[00:39:38 - 00:39:38] to figure out miss zita
[00:39:38 - 00:39:40] how to figure out miss
[00:39:40 - 00:39:42] zita congratulations congratulations on that
[00:39:43 - 00:39:43] so that's going to result
[00:39:43 - 00:39:48] in more expense to us
[00:39:48 - 00:39:48] so about 200 200 000
[00:39:50 - 00:39:50] we're expecting who's who's not
[00:39:50 - 00:39:52] the gatsby who who comes
[00:39:52 - 00:39:53] up with all these new
[00:39:53 - 00:39:55] formulas so the governmental accounting
[00:39:55 - 00:39:59] standards board gatsby mr colleagues
[00:39:59 - 00:40:04] mr colleagues is the standard
[00:40:04 - 00:40:04] set setting uh body is
[00:40:04 - 00:40:04] the standard set setting uh
[00:40:04 - 00:40:07] body yeah yeah for uh
[00:40:07 - 00:40:10] governmental on the private sector
[00:40:10 - 00:40:10] it's fazby we are on
[00:40:10 - 00:40:13] the governmental side we're gazsby
[00:40:13 - 00:40:15] so so um if we
[00:40:15 - 00:40:17] don't comply with the pronouncements
[00:40:17 - 00:40:19] we could get an unmodified
[00:40:19 - 00:40:21] opinion in our annual financial
[00:40:21 - 00:40:21] report and so that would
[00:40:22 - 00:40:24] be really bad for us
[00:40:24 - 00:40:26] our annual financial report is
[00:40:26 - 00:40:28] critical to getting pal funding
[00:40:28 - 00:40:30] uh governmental entities look at
[00:40:30 - 00:40:30] how our journal controls that
[00:40:30 - 00:40:33] i mean that's that has
[00:40:33 - 00:40:35] so much impact the financial
[00:40:35 - 00:40:35] report we don't have a
[00:40:35 - 00:40:39] choice in the gazbies mr
[00:40:39 - 00:40:40] mr hagerty we don't have
[00:40:40 - 00:40:40] a choice we have to
[00:40:40 - 00:40:42] comply with that oh i
[00:40:42 - 00:40:42] know we have to comply
[00:40:44 - 00:40:44] but it seems like they
[00:40:44 - 00:40:45] come up with a new
[00:40:45 - 00:40:48] one every year like i
[00:40:48 - 00:40:48] said gi 68 and 75
[00:40:48 - 00:40:51] impact us by und00 million
[00:40:51 - 00:40:53] right to our fund balance
[00:40:53 - 00:40:53] when those hit in 2016
[00:40:55 - 00:40:55] so that money just sits
[00:40:55 - 00:40:55] there so that money just
[00:40:55 - 00:40:57] sits there boom boom do
[00:40:57 - 00:40:57] we get any interest on
[00:40:57 - 00:40:58] that money we do we
[00:40:58 - 00:41:01] do okay okay great question
[00:41:04 - 00:41:04] each gazby like gaza has
[00:41:04 - 00:41:05] an identified each gazby like
[00:41:05 - 00:41:07] gaza has an identified target
[00:41:07 - 00:41:09] target has a different focus
[00:41:09 - 00:41:11] these guys and how are
[00:41:11 - 00:41:11] we how many gases are
[00:41:11 - 00:41:13] we subject to now 75
[00:41:15 - 00:41:15] they're up to 101 up
[00:41:15 - 00:41:18] to 101 how many of
[00:41:18 - 00:41:21] those are fully funded as
[00:41:21 - 00:41:21] far as none of them
[00:41:21 - 00:41:23] result in uh increased liabilities
[00:41:23 - 00:41:25] they they have a different
[00:41:25 - 00:41:25] area of focus they have
[00:41:25 - 00:41:27] some of them can be
[00:41:27 - 00:41:29] displayed how you show deferred
[00:41:29 - 00:41:31] outflows and inflows which won't
[00:41:31 - 00:41:31] have an impact it'll just
[00:41:31 - 00:41:32] mean this aggregating information and
[00:41:34 - 00:41:37] presenting it differently yeah but
[00:41:37 - 00:41:37] with regards to 68 and
[00:41:37 - 00:41:39] 75 we are fully funed
[00:41:39 - 00:41:42] on those we didn't used
[00:41:42 - 00:41:42] to be we are now
[00:41:45 - 00:41:45] as far as i mean
[00:41:45 - 00:41:47] actual financial exposure to what
[00:41:47 - 00:41:51] is required we're we're funded
[00:41:51 - 00:41:51] up to but not 101
[00:41:53 - 00:41:53] we don't know what 101's
[00:41:53 - 00:41:55] impact is going to be
[00:41:55 - 00:41:55] but we're estimating at least
[00:41:56 - 00:41:56] currently that it would be
[00:41:56 - 00:41:57] a few currently that it
[00:41:57 - 00:41:57] would be a few hundred
[00:41:57 - 00:41:58] 000 hundred 000 hundred 000
[00:41:59 - 00:41:59] 400 000 400 000 400
[00:41:59 - 00:42:02] 000 change change we'd be
[00:42:02 - 00:42:02] able currently to cover that
[00:42:04 - 00:42:06] that's correct okay so those
[00:42:06 - 00:42:06] are those are the main
[00:42:08 - 00:42:08] considerations in the strategic planning
[00:42:11 - 00:42:11] for uh the coming budget
[00:42:11 - 00:42:12] development for uh the coming
[00:42:13 - 00:42:17] budget development process process so
[00:42:17 - 00:42:17] we look at hb8 uh
[00:42:17 - 00:42:20] funding model uh as dr
[00:42:20 - 00:42:20] sarata said we got the
[00:42:20 - 00:42:25] the near final runs that
[00:42:25 - 00:42:25] sounds really um not so
[00:42:29 - 00:42:29] final anyway um we we
[00:42:29 - 00:42:32] are budgeting that amount in
[00:42:32 - 00:42:35] the revenue projections for next
[00:42:35 - 00:42:35] year um and as a
[00:42:35 - 00:42:37] review that's based upon fundable
[00:42:37 - 00:42:40] credentials credentials of value 15
[00:42:40 - 00:42:43] semester credit hours of dual
[00:42:43 - 00:42:43] credit those are the the
[00:42:45 - 00:42:45] big uh performance measure outcomes
[00:42:45 - 00:42:49] that we're measured by that
[00:42:49 - 00:42:52] result in our uh appropriation
[00:42:52 - 00:42:52] and then on top of
[00:42:52 - 00:42:55] that if the students that
[00:42:55 - 00:42:57] um help us with these
[00:42:57 - 00:42:58] outcomes if they are economically
[00:43:00 - 00:43:00] disadvantaged academically we get a
[00:43:02 - 00:43:02] little bump as well a
[00:43:02 - 00:43:05] small amount so it's a
[00:43:05 - 00:43:06] pretty complicated formula and then
[00:43:06 - 00:43:06] adult learners we get a
[00:43:06 - 00:43:07] little then adult learners we
[00:43:07 - 00:43:08] get a little bumper bumper
[00:43:10 - 00:43:10] this is a funding model
[00:43:10 - 00:43:13] for next year right and
[00:43:13 - 00:43:15] this is projected state funding
[00:43:15 - 00:43:15] and what we're projecting is
[00:43:18 - 00:43:18] that our projected revenue is
[00:43:18 - 00:43:20] 48a so in other words
[00:43:20 - 00:43:23] we're projecting a about a
[00:43:23 - 00:43:25] 5 million uh decrease in
[00:43:26 - 00:43:26] state uh decrease in state
[00:43:26 - 00:43:29] so so we're not he'll
[00:43:29 - 00:43:32] touch on that shortly great
[00:43:32 - 00:43:32] question uh mr the piece
[00:43:32 - 00:43:34] of that is the fast
[00:43:34 - 00:43:36] funding so we're going to
[00:43:36 - 00:43:36] talk about that a little
[00:43:36 - 00:43:38] bit would that be additive
[00:43:38 - 00:43:39] to the 43 that's correct
[00:43:39 - 00:43:43] that's correct okay okay so
[00:43:43 - 00:43:43] we're going to talk about
[00:43:43 - 00:43:45] the fast so we're going
[00:43:45 - 00:43:48] to talk about the fast
[00:43:49 - 00:43:50] um so these are some
[00:43:50 - 00:43:51] major do we have to
[00:43:51 - 00:43:56] hire somebody separately just to
[00:43:56 - 00:43:56] keep track of the government
[00:43:58 - 00:44:01] the full employment um so
[00:44:01 - 00:44:01] these are some of the
[00:44:01 - 00:44:05] major rule changes that have
[00:44:05 - 00:44:08] occurred um that impact our
[00:44:08 - 00:44:10] performance outcomes so these are
[00:44:10 - 00:44:10] the new rules now that
[00:44:10 - 00:44:13] are going to affect our
[00:44:13 - 00:44:15] funding uh they limited uh
[00:44:15 - 00:44:19] stack credentials to one award
[00:44:19 - 00:44:19] per type per student per
[00:44:19 - 00:44:22] year um the new credentials
[00:44:22 - 00:44:25] value test for associate degree
[00:44:25 - 00:44:27] they've shortened the uh return
[00:44:27 - 00:44:27] on investment period from 10
[00:44:29 - 00:44:29] years to five years and
[00:44:29 - 00:44:32] they've also said that they
[00:44:32 - 00:44:32] have to have a salary
[00:44:32 - 00:44:33] of said that they have
[00:44:33 - 00:44:34] to have a salary of
[00:44:34 - 00:44:35] 30 000 30 000 if
[00:44:35 - 00:44:35] they meet that criteria we're
[00:44:36 - 00:44:38] going to get funding for
[00:44:38 - 00:44:38] it um if they don't
[00:44:40 - 00:44:40] meet that criteria we won't
[00:44:40 - 00:44:45] get funding for it so
[00:44:45 - 00:44:45] um exempted from those uh
[00:44:47 - 00:44:47] from that criteria are education
[00:44:47 - 00:44:48] and from that criteria are
[00:44:48 - 00:44:51] education and healthcare healthcare uh
[00:44:51 - 00:44:51] degrees and programs that we
[00:44:51 - 00:44:54] might have and um also
[00:44:54 - 00:44:56] another change is fundable transfer
[00:44:56 - 00:44:58] to private and independent colleges
[00:44:58 - 00:45:00] and universities formerly we only
[00:45:00 - 00:45:00] got credit they went to
[00:45:03 - 00:45:03] a public college or university
[00:45:03 - 00:45:06] now transfers to private institutions
[00:45:06 - 00:45:09] those are called referred to
[00:45:09 - 00:45:10] as i cuts independent colleges
[00:45:10 - 00:45:11] and university independent colleges and
[00:45:12 - 00:45:15] university transfers transfers then uh
[00:45:15 - 00:45:15] they also are maintaining the
[00:45:17 - 00:45:18] credit hour threshold for institutional
[00:45:20 - 00:45:20] credential leading to lensure or
[00:45:23 - 00:45:23] certification so those are the
[00:45:23 - 00:45:27] changes that have built been
[00:45:27 - 00:45:29] built into that appropriation that
[00:45:29 - 00:45:31] you saw earlier the 43
[00:45:31 - 00:45:31] million those are these changes
[00:45:35 - 00:45:35] are already reflective into that
[00:45:35 - 00:45:37] number what is a new
[00:45:37 - 00:45:40] credential i think i know
[00:45:43 - 00:45:45] the first second line oh
[00:45:45 - 00:45:45] the new what he's referencing
[00:45:45 - 00:45:47] is um the current credentials
[00:45:47 - 00:45:51] but what we did is
[00:45:51 - 00:45:51] at the state level so
[00:45:51 - 00:45:52] i'm gonna i'm presenting to
[00:45:52 - 00:45:52] the board today on the
[00:45:54 - 00:45:54] legislature so i'll give you
[00:45:54 - 00:45:59] a preview i'm going to
[00:45:59 - 00:46:01] speak to um when we
[00:46:01 - 00:46:01] start when we worked on
[00:46:01 - 00:46:03] house bill 8 with the
[00:46:03 - 00:46:06] coordinating board in the legislature
[00:46:06 - 00:46:06] we set a timeline of
[00:46:06 - 00:46:08] 10 years and that within
[00:46:08 - 00:46:10] that 10-year period every single
[00:46:10 - 00:46:12] credential that the college produces
[00:46:12 - 00:46:15] is considered a credential of
[00:46:15 - 00:46:15] value so as we go
[00:46:15 - 00:46:18] into the 89th legislative session
[00:46:18 - 00:46:20] so we started that in
[00:46:20 - 00:46:20] 23 we got the first
[00:46:23 - 00:46:23] funding for it in 23
[00:46:23 - 00:46:26] we turn around and in
[00:46:26 - 00:46:26] 25 the legislature meets and
[00:46:26 - 00:46:28] the legislature determined that the
[00:46:31 - 00:46:31] community college sector was overheating
[00:46:34 - 00:46:34] and so they had to
[00:46:34 - 00:46:37] find ways that the dynamic
[00:46:37 - 00:46:37] system wasn't quite as dynamic
[00:46:39 - 00:46:39] so we went from a
[00:46:39 - 00:46:43] 10-year time frame to a
[00:46:43 - 00:46:43] fiveyear time frame in two
[00:46:43 - 00:46:45] years so that's why not
[00:46:45 - 00:46:47] all of our credentials are
[00:46:47 - 00:46:47] considered credentials of value now
[00:46:49 - 00:46:49] because some of them take
[00:46:49 - 00:46:51] longer than five years for
[00:46:51 - 00:46:51] the student to see a
[00:46:53 - 00:46:55] return on their investment just
[00:46:55 - 00:46:55] one new a credential is
[00:46:55 - 00:46:57] like you're certified to be
[00:46:57 - 00:46:59] an hvac tech no but
[00:46:59 - 00:46:59] what the reference in that
[00:46:59 - 00:47:02] is is that the new
[00:47:02 - 00:47:02] not not the new credential
[00:47:13 - 00:47:13] i was just wondering does
[00:47:13 - 00:47:15] that mean that you're getting
[00:47:15 - 00:47:15] paid for adding new cte
[00:47:15 - 00:47:16] you're getting paid for adding
[00:47:16 - 00:47:19] new cte programs programs we
[00:47:19 - 00:47:19] would we would but but
[00:47:19 - 00:47:20] it he's not referencing credentials
[00:47:20 - 00:47:22] he's referencing the theoretic how
[00:47:25 - 00:47:25] credentials of value are measured
[00:47:25 - 00:47:30] credentials of value are measured
[00:47:31 - 00:47:33] okay some other changes are
[00:47:33 - 00:47:35] changes in credentials of value
[00:47:35 - 00:47:38] to exclude certain associate degrees
[00:47:38 - 00:47:40] um certain uh degrees are
[00:47:40 - 00:47:40] not considered credentials of value
[00:47:44 - 00:47:44] for funding purposes uh anymore
[00:47:44 - 00:47:47] this is a change um
[00:47:47 - 00:47:47] if they don't meet the
[00:47:50 - 00:47:50] requirement on the fiveyear uh
[00:47:50 - 00:47:54] payback period and the 30
[00:47:54 - 00:47:57] 000 annual salary then we
[00:47:57 - 00:47:57] won't get funding um for
[00:47:57 - 00:47:58] those credentials if they don't
[00:47:58 - 00:47:59] meet that credentials if they
[00:47:59 - 00:48:00] don't meet that threshold threshold
[00:48:02 - 00:48:02] uh the specific areas that
[00:48:02 - 00:48:11] are impacted we did an
[00:48:11 - 00:48:12] analysis of those six zip
[00:48:15 - 00:48:15] codes and we produced 450
[00:48:15 - 00:48:19] approximately 450 degrees in the
[00:48:19 - 00:48:21] in those respective areas so
[00:48:21 - 00:48:21] we anticipated that that would
[00:48:29 - 00:48:29] are these mostly stuff that
[00:48:29 - 00:48:30] would take longer than five
[00:48:30 - 00:48:33] years to it takes well
[00:48:33 - 00:48:33] because all of those are
[00:48:34 - 00:48:36] intended to transfer those are
[00:48:36 - 00:48:38] degrees intended to transfer and
[00:48:38 - 00:48:38] so they really shouldn't start
[00:48:38 - 00:48:40] the clock until after the
[00:48:40 - 00:48:42] student receives the balora degree
[00:48:44 - 00:48:44] but they're starting the clock
[00:48:44 - 00:48:49] as soon and that was
[00:48:49 - 00:48:49] a change from the prior
[00:48:52 - 00:48:52] year uh before that it
[00:48:52 - 00:48:55] was a 10year period but
[00:48:55 - 00:48:58] uh their logic was universities
[00:48:58 - 00:48:58] 10 year and colleges are
[00:49:02 - 00:49:02] given 10 year colleges should
[00:49:02 - 00:49:05] be twoear should be half
[00:49:05 - 00:49:05] of the 10 year so
[00:49:05 - 00:49:08] they're going to do that
[00:49:10 - 00:49:11] the state transition yeah we
[00:49:11 - 00:49:13] submit everything mr tremendous to
[00:49:13 - 00:49:13] the coordinating board so every
[00:49:15 - 00:49:15] year you know the coordinating
[00:49:15 - 00:49:17] board knows when a student
[00:49:17 - 00:49:19] first enrolled their first time
[00:49:19 - 00:49:21] in college student they turn
[00:49:21 - 00:49:21] around and measure the student
[00:49:23 - 00:49:23] as they go forward so
[00:49:23 - 00:49:25] we submit all of our
[00:49:25 - 00:49:25] data to the coordinating board
[00:49:25 - 00:49:28] and then the coordinating board
[00:49:28 - 00:49:31] um um crunches that data
[00:49:31 - 00:49:33] and determines what they're not
[00:49:33 - 00:49:33] you know i've gone back
[00:49:35 - 00:49:35] and forth with commissioner roser
[00:49:35 - 00:49:37] as well as um deputy
[00:49:37 - 00:49:38] commissioner troutman on some of
[00:49:38 - 00:49:41] the measures that they're looking
[00:49:41 - 00:49:41] at um so as we
[00:49:41 - 00:49:42] went forward they were saying
[00:49:42 - 00:49:44] well it's taking students five
[00:49:44 - 00:49:45] years to earn an associates
[00:49:45 - 00:49:46] degree and i'm said i'm
[00:49:48 - 00:49:48] looking at your data that
[00:49:48 - 00:49:50] you produce and it indicates
[00:49:50 - 00:49:50] that we're taking 3 7
[00:49:53 - 00:49:53] years to produce an associates
[00:49:53 - 00:49:55] degree but that's full-time students
[00:49:55 - 00:49:57] and they're looking at everyone
[00:49:57 - 00:50:01] full-time and part-time together the
[00:50:01 - 00:50:01] important thing is that they
[00:50:01 - 00:50:11] hire so at a very
[00:50:11 - 00:50:13] high level view of community
[00:50:13 - 00:50:13] colleges how they got funded
[00:50:16 - 00:50:16] this year so for the
[00:50:16 - 00:50:18] current year the one we're
[00:50:18 - 00:50:18] operating in now the state
[00:50:21 - 00:50:21] had awarded 2 2 billion
[00:50:23 - 00:50:23] and so because the community
[00:50:23 - 00:50:24] colleges and so because the
[00:50:24 - 00:50:28] community colleges outperformed outperformed um
[00:50:28 - 00:50:28] the year uh there's a
[00:50:28 - 00:50:30] supplemental funding that increased the
[00:50:30 - 00:50:35] funding for the current year
[00:50:35 - 00:50:39] to 2 36 billion um
[00:50:39 - 00:50:39] and then for next year
[00:50:39 - 00:50:42] the amount is going to
[00:50:42 - 00:50:42] increase to 2 4 billion
[00:50:42 - 00:50:45] for the community college so
[00:50:45 - 00:50:47] as as the funding is
[00:50:47 - 00:50:50] increasing uh the funding reflects
[00:50:50 - 00:50:54] all fy26 new laws and
[00:50:54 - 00:50:54] rules proposed at the uh
[00:50:54 - 00:50:55] by the coordinating board august
[00:50:55 - 00:50:59] special board meeting where they'll
[00:50:59 - 00:51:01] be approved uh they'll this
[00:51:01 - 00:51:01] does not this funding does
[00:51:04 - 00:51:04] not include um opportunity high
[00:51:04 - 00:51:07] school diplomas i think we
[00:51:07 - 00:51:11] are a site for that
[00:51:11 - 00:51:11] and um third party credentials
[00:51:11 - 00:51:15] and any anticipated uh fiscal
[00:51:15 - 00:51:18] year 26 dynamic adjustment or
[00:51:18 - 00:51:21] fiscal year 25 setup settle
[00:51:21 - 00:51:23] means that what you performed
[00:51:23 - 00:51:25] compared to what they forecasted
[00:51:25 - 00:51:26] for you and then they'll
[00:51:27 - 00:51:27] settle off with you if
[00:51:27 - 00:51:29] they owe you anything that's
[00:51:29 - 00:51:33] okay now legislature ban every
[00:51:33 - 00:51:33] two years does this every
[00:51:33 - 00:51:34] two years or did you
[00:51:34 - 00:51:34] get to review it every
[00:51:34 - 00:51:35] years or did you get
[00:51:35 - 00:51:35] to review it every year
[00:51:35 - 00:51:36] year every year every year
[00:51:36 - 00:51:38] okay every year and the
[00:51:38 - 00:51:40] coordinating board will make those
[00:51:40 - 00:51:43] adjustments and so then we
[00:51:43 - 00:51:43] will see funding either go
[00:51:43 - 00:51:47] up based on outperforming or
[00:51:47 - 00:51:47] go down if it goes
[00:51:49 - 00:51:49] down it's not taken out
[00:51:49 - 00:51:51] immediately it's taken out in
[00:51:51 - 00:52:04] the october of the so
[00:52:04 - 00:52:04] this talks about how we
[00:52:04 - 00:52:08] received the funding from the
[00:52:08 - 00:52:11] state um this week we're
[00:52:11 - 00:52:11] supposed to receive our last
[00:52:13 - 00:52:13] installment for appropriation for the
[00:52:15 - 00:52:15] current operating year so we're
[00:52:17 - 00:52:17] supposed to receive 25 of
[00:52:17 - 00:52:23] the current year appropriation uh
[00:52:23 - 00:52:23] in september we're supposed to
[00:52:25 - 00:52:25] receive anything that they might
[00:52:25 - 00:52:27] owe us for the current
[00:52:27 - 00:52:30] year and so that's the
[00:52:30 - 00:52:32] fy25 foundation payment we're going
[00:52:32 - 00:52:35] to receive it in september
[00:52:35 - 00:52:35] if they owe us any
[00:52:35 - 00:52:37] additional money they're going to
[00:52:37 - 00:52:39] owe us a very small
[00:52:39 - 00:52:43] amount of money um that's
[00:52:43 - 00:52:43] still pending in on october
[00:52:46 - 00:52:46] 15th that's the first payment
[00:52:46 - 00:52:50] of next year's appropriation and
[00:52:50 - 00:52:54] they all just 50 of
[00:52:54 - 00:52:58] their appropriation in advance so
[00:52:58 - 00:52:58] that's the 50 in october
[00:52:58 - 00:53:01] 15 fy26 foundation payment and
[00:53:01 - 00:53:04] then if there's any other
[00:53:04 - 00:53:04] fisc year 25 projected any
[00:53:05 - 00:53:06] other fisc year 25 projected
[00:53:06 - 00:53:08] settlement settlement that means that
[00:53:08 - 00:53:11] we continue to report information
[00:53:11 - 00:53:11] state and they compare it
[00:53:11 - 00:53:13] to what they projected for
[00:53:13 - 00:53:16] us any difference if they
[00:53:16 - 00:53:19] owe us money they'll provide
[00:53:19 - 00:53:19] it to us on october
[00:53:19 - 00:53:23] 15 so so all of
[00:53:23 - 00:53:23] this you covered up to
[00:53:23 - 00:53:25] now all is how they
[00:53:25 - 00:53:26] slice and dice the 48
[00:53:27 - 00:53:27] million at least this year
[00:53:30 - 00:53:33] yes sir wow our two
[00:53:33 - 00:53:38] people so um the last
[00:53:38 - 00:53:38] bullet is uh fiscal year
[00:53:41 - 00:53:41] 25 projected setup what is
[00:53:41 - 00:53:45] it it's the difference between
[00:53:45 - 00:53:48] uh 25 performance as dispersed
[00:53:48 - 00:53:48] compared to how we actually
[00:53:48 - 00:53:49] dispersed compared to how we
[00:53:49 - 00:53:52] actually perform perform that's called
[00:53:52 - 00:53:54] keep track our appropriation numbers
[00:53:54 - 00:53:58] and then we actually reporting
[00:54:01 - 00:54:01] and then they recalculate dollars
[00:54:01 - 00:54:04] and then there's a difference
[00:54:04 - 00:54:06] that's called set up can
[00:54:06 - 00:54:21] also be negatives tact there's
[00:54:21 - 00:54:21] 18 colleges that are that
[00:54:21 - 00:54:23] the runs just came out
[00:54:23 - 00:54:25] i had an advanced copy
[00:54:25 - 00:54:25] of it and that's why
[00:54:25 - 00:54:27] i provided it to mr
[00:54:27 - 00:54:27] flores but they literally just
[00:54:29 - 00:54:29] came out while we're in
[00:54:29 - 00:54:32] this meeting um 34 minutes
[00:54:32 - 00:54:32] ago um to all the
[00:54:32 - 00:54:35] presidents in their areas and
[00:54:35 - 00:54:38] 18 colleges are seeing um
[00:54:38 - 00:54:38] a downward adjustment based on
[00:54:41 - 00:54:41] their outcomes um the highest
[00:54:41 - 00:54:44] colin counties losing 3 1
[00:54:44 - 00:54:46] million lone star's losing just
[00:54:46 - 00:54:48] under three million big colleges
[00:54:48 - 00:54:49] small colleges or just across
[00:54:49 - 00:54:50] the board across the board
[00:54:50 - 00:54:50] but those two that i
[00:54:52 - 00:54:52] just mentioned are are two
[00:54:52 - 00:54:53] of the largest in the
[00:54:53 - 00:54:55] state but for them given
[00:54:55 - 00:54:56] their tax base that's no
[00:54:56 - 00:55:02] big deal right so so
[00:55:02 - 00:55:02] what's important to note from
[00:55:04 - 00:55:04] those comments and the discussion
[00:55:04 - 00:55:06] on settleup is there's there's
[00:55:06 - 00:55:10] inherent risk in our projected
[00:55:10 - 00:55:12] revenues when we budget and
[00:55:12 - 00:55:14] we project revenues there's risk
[00:55:14 - 00:55:14] in our budget development we
[00:55:14 - 00:55:17] have to be conservative because
[00:55:17 - 00:55:20] things can turn and we
[00:55:20 - 00:55:20] have to absorb any turn
[00:55:20 - 00:55:21] and we have to absorb
[00:55:21 - 00:55:30] any decreases decreases but let's
[00:55:30 - 00:55:30] go back a little bit
[00:55:33 - 00:55:33] so um those are the
[00:55:33 - 00:55:38] upcoming payments other changes that
[00:55:38 - 00:55:41] are happening um so they're
[00:55:41 - 00:55:43] also accelerating there there's several
[00:55:43 - 00:55:45] reports that the college generates
[00:55:45 - 00:55:45] to the state that are
[00:55:46 - 00:55:46] required the report of fundable
[00:55:50 - 00:55:50] operating expenditures the rfoe normally
[00:55:52 - 00:55:52] that's due at the end
[00:55:52 - 00:55:53] of january so laura is
[00:55:53 - 00:55:53] going to have to have
[00:55:53 - 00:55:56] that ready by the end
[00:55:56 - 00:55:59] of december so they're accelerating
[00:55:59 - 00:56:02] that by a month um
[00:56:02 - 00:56:02] that's that sounds simple on
[00:56:02 - 00:56:05] the face but we have
[00:56:05 - 00:56:05] to have the audit done
[00:56:05 - 00:56:07] so we can do that
[00:56:07 - 00:56:07] so it's kind of a
[00:56:07 - 00:56:08] cascading thing we're going to
[00:56:08 - 00:56:10] have to push everything back
[00:56:10 - 00:56:13] and organize ourselves to uh
[00:56:13 - 00:56:13] to meet those reporting deadlines
[00:56:15 - 00:56:15] by a month that are
[00:56:15 - 00:56:17] different uh the carrot the
[00:56:17 - 00:56:19] community college annual reporting analysis
[00:56:19 - 00:56:23] tool was due january 31st
[00:56:23 - 00:56:23] that's moved to december 31st
[00:56:23 - 00:56:25] um the annual financial reports
[00:56:25 - 00:56:28] has the same deadline but
[00:56:28 - 00:56:29] it impacts information going into
[00:56:29 - 00:56:32] those other reports so we're
[00:56:32 - 00:56:35] going to have to finish
[00:56:35 - 00:56:35] the audit quicker and compile
[00:56:35 - 00:56:38] any financial statements as quick
[00:56:38 - 00:56:43] as real quick i mean
[00:56:43 - 00:56:45] just way high level out
[00:56:45 - 00:56:45] of curiosity how is all
[00:56:45 - 00:56:47] this funded at the state
[00:56:47 - 00:56:49] davis is this totally unfunded
[00:56:49 - 00:56:49] within the uh the state
[00:56:50 - 00:56:52] of texas or what i'm
[00:56:52 - 00:56:55] concerned about or curious about
[00:56:55 - 00:56:55] is that if if we
[00:56:55 - 00:56:57] go through and get rid
[00:56:57 - 00:57:00] of department of education in
[00:57:00 - 00:57:00] worst case and you know
[00:57:00 - 00:57:04] the goes to crap uh
[00:57:06 - 00:57:06] do we suffer any kind
[00:57:06 - 00:57:07] of exposure if the federal
[00:57:07 - 00:57:07] government goes wild and does
[00:57:08 - 00:57:10] stupid things stupid things yes
[00:57:10 - 00:57:13] yes we do um and
[00:57:13 - 00:57:13] so the grants that mr
[00:57:16 - 00:57:16] flores mentioned earlier when um
[00:57:16 - 00:57:17] the administration these are grants
[00:57:17 - 00:57:19] that congress had already allocated
[00:57:19 - 00:57:21] and then the administration said
[00:57:21 - 00:57:24] we're going to cap administrative
[00:57:24 - 00:57:27] overhead at 15 and so
[00:57:27 - 00:57:27] utep felt it much more
[00:57:29 - 00:57:29] significantly than we did but
[00:57:29 - 00:57:32] there are grants that we
[00:57:32 - 00:57:32] have as well where that
[00:57:35 - 00:57:35] nsf nih etc grants when
[00:57:35 - 00:57:39] they're capped at 15 and
[00:57:39 - 00:57:41] they'd already been allocated i
[00:57:41 - 00:57:41] don't have an issue with
[00:57:43 - 00:57:43] saying from this point forward
[00:57:43 - 00:57:44] if you apply for a
[00:57:44 - 00:57:48] grant your administrative overhead must
[00:57:48 - 00:57:48] be no more than 15
[00:57:48 - 00:57:49] but within the rules and
[00:57:49 - 00:57:52] regulations that existed yesterday and
[00:57:52 - 00:57:54] now today we say we're
[00:57:54 - 00:57:54] going to cap you at
[00:57:54 - 00:57:57] 15 for what we've already
[00:57:57 - 00:57:59] allocated that's caused a lot
[00:57:59 - 00:57:59] of havoc across higher education
[00:58:00 - 00:58:00] not just in the state
[00:58:00 - 00:58:03] but in the nation um
[00:58:03 - 00:58:06] in addition there's several grants
[00:58:06 - 00:58:06] that the team and i
[00:58:06 - 00:58:08] are working on that the
[00:58:08 - 00:58:08] college has that the federal
[00:58:10 - 00:58:10] government has frozen and is
[00:58:10 - 00:58:13] in the process of eliminating
[00:58:13 - 00:58:15] um and we have real
[00:58:15 - 00:58:15] individuals that are running good
[00:58:18 - 00:58:18] grants that have we we've
[00:58:18 - 00:58:20] had for 20 plus years
[00:58:20 - 00:58:20] that we are now going
[00:58:20 - 00:58:20] to plus years that we
[00:58:20 - 00:58:20] are now going to lose
[00:58:20 - 00:58:23] lose it's mostly at the
[00:58:23 - 00:58:25] grant level for grants but
[00:58:25 - 00:58:25] not the general for grants
[00:58:25 - 00:58:25] but not the general operation
[00:58:25 - 00:58:27] operation it's at the grant
[00:58:27 - 00:58:27] level on one hand on
[00:58:30 - 00:58:30] the other hand um it's
[00:58:30 - 00:58:34] at the pel so the
[00:58:34 - 00:58:34] the the the bbb uh
[00:58:34 - 00:58:37] the big beautiful bill from
[00:58:37 - 00:58:37] the house version um was
[00:58:37 - 00:58:40] going to impact 360 000
[00:58:40 - 00:58:43] students in the state of
[00:58:43 - 00:58:43] texas um that would lose
[00:58:43 - 00:58:46] pel completely um so that's
[00:58:46 - 00:58:48] a significant impact to to
[00:58:48 - 00:58:48] the state and to it
[00:58:48 - 00:58:50] would be a significant impact
[00:58:50 - 00:58:52] to us dr amaya can
[00:58:52 - 00:58:52] you remind me what we
[00:58:54 - 00:58:54] estimated we estimated i think
[00:58:54 - 00:58:57] 9 million of a pel
[00:58:57 - 00:59:00] hit and so we administer
[00:59:00 - 00:59:02] approximately 60 million so we'd
[00:59:02 - 00:59:02] be looking at about a
[00:59:02 - 00:59:02] 15 hit to we'd be
[00:59:02 - 00:59:03] looking at about a 15
[00:59:03 - 00:59:07] hit to pel pel and
[00:59:07 - 00:59:07] this is an unknown deadline
[00:59:07 - 00:59:08] right it's on the senate
[00:59:08 - 00:59:10] side the senate fixed a
[00:59:10 - 00:59:13] lot senator cassidy from louisiana
[00:59:13 - 00:59:13] the chair um fixed a
[00:59:13 - 00:59:15] lot but it has to
[00:59:15 - 00:59:15] go back to the house
[00:59:15 - 00:59:18] and the house has to
[00:59:18 - 00:59:19] agree to those the house
[00:59:20 - 00:59:25] has to agree to those
[00:59:26 - 00:59:29] wow so things look good
[00:59:29 - 00:59:30] for now that's why you
[00:59:30 - 00:59:30] got to be concerned we
[00:59:32 - 00:59:32] don't know what the government's
[00:59:32 - 00:59:40] going to do cut cut
[00:59:42 - 00:59:42] there there's another bill um
[00:59:42 - 00:59:44] at the state level that's
[00:59:44 - 00:59:52] going to impact this and
[00:59:52 - 00:59:52] so um that bill proposes
[00:59:52 - 00:59:54] or is changing the threshold
[00:59:56 - 00:59:56] for competitive bidding from 50
[00:59:56 - 00:59:58] to for competitive bidding from
[00:59:58 - 01:00:03] 50 to 100 000 okay
[01:00:03 - 01:00:03] so um that will be
[01:00:03 - 01:00:07] effective september 1st 2025 that's
[01:00:07 - 01:00:09] significant and brought brought to
[01:00:09 - 01:00:11] uh the presentation today for
[01:00:11 - 01:00:16] discussion uh for discussion because
[01:00:16 - 01:00:18] um right now we take
[01:00:18 - 01:00:21] to the board competitive purchases
[01:00:21 - 01:00:21] 50 000 and higher we
[01:00:21 - 01:00:25] have to take them to
[01:00:25 - 01:00:27] the board for approval and
[01:00:27 - 01:00:29] so um that is the
[01:00:29 - 01:00:32] board's choice the amount that
[01:00:32 - 01:00:32] we take to the for
[01:00:32 - 01:00:34] approval we have to competitively
[01:00:34 - 01:00:36] build bill them because that's
[01:00:36 - 01:00:36] what the state says but
[01:00:38 - 01:00:38] that threshold is going from
[01:00:38 - 01:00:43] 50 to 100 000 that
[01:00:43 - 01:00:43] the state has raised that
[01:00:48 - 01:00:48] so um the discussion here
[01:00:48 - 01:00:51] is for the board to
[01:00:51 - 01:00:55] understand this change and to
[01:00:55 - 01:00:55] consider what in september you
[01:00:58 - 01:00:58] want us to take to
[01:00:58 - 01:01:00] the board for approval for
[01:01:00 - 01:01:08] perspective in 2009 the threshold
[01:01:08 - 01:01:08] went from 25 000 to
[01:01:08 - 01:01:10] 50 so the board at
[01:01:10 - 01:01:12] that time said well the
[01:01:12 - 01:01:16] threshold for competitive bidding went
[01:01:16 - 01:01:16] from 25 to 50 then
[01:01:16 - 01:01:20] only bring to us for
[01:01:20 - 01:01:24] approval items competitive items bid
[01:01:24 - 01:01:27] competitively bid items for 50
[01:01:27 - 01:01:27] 000 so it changed in
[01:01:27 - 01:01:30] 2009 this is the same
[01:01:30 - 01:01:32] happening going from 50 to
[01:01:32 - 01:01:36] 100 so the board can
[01:01:36 - 01:01:36] decide what you want us
[01:01:39 - 01:01:39] to take to the board
[01:01:39 - 01:01:42] for approval that's your decision
[01:01:42 - 01:01:42] you can keep it at
[01:01:46 - 01:01:46] the 50 or you can
[01:01:46 - 01:01:46] say we want we want
[01:01:46 - 01:01:50] to move with change statement
[01:01:50 - 01:01:53] uh it's my understanding that
[01:01:53 - 01:01:55] uh austin community colleges austin
[01:01:55 - 01:01:58] community college requires 150 000
[01:01:58 - 01:01:58] to be taken to their
[01:02:00 - 01:02:00] board now they still have
[01:02:00 - 01:02:03] to comply with the 50
[01:02:03 - 01:02:03] 000 bidding rule from the
[01:02:06 - 01:02:06] state but their board has
[01:02:06 - 01:02:08] decided 150 agreed that's just
[01:02:08 - 01:02:11] an example i'm not advocating
[01:02:11 - 01:02:11] for that it's just an
[01:02:15 - 01:02:15] example but it's your choice
[01:02:18 - 01:02:18] what you would like us
[01:02:18 - 01:02:22] to bring now the potential
[01:02:22 - 01:02:22] impact if if uh we
[01:02:22 - 01:02:26] only take items 100 000
[01:02:26 - 01:02:26] and more to you there'll
[01:02:29 - 01:02:29] probably be a reduction of
[01:02:29 - 01:02:31] about 60 in the items
[01:02:31 - 01:02:31] that are taken for your
[01:02:40 - 01:02:40] now who approves them besides
[01:02:40 - 01:02:42] the board like if it's
[01:02:42 - 01:02:45] going to be at 100
[01:02:45 - 01:02:45] 000 and let's say you
[01:02:45 - 01:02:47] already approved it on your
[01:02:47 - 01:02:51] end and everybody's worked on
[01:02:51 - 01:02:51] it by the time it
[01:02:51 - 01:02:54] comes to us it's already
[01:02:54 - 01:02:54] been vetted by the by
[01:02:54 - 01:02:56] the president and by everybody
[01:02:56 - 01:02:59] right yes and there's considerable
[01:03:00 - 01:03:00] purchasing yes and there's considerable
[01:03:00 - 01:03:03] purchasing rules rules right mr
[01:03:03 - 01:03:03] gallo has to comply with
[01:03:07 - 01:03:07] tons of competitive bidding different
[01:03:10 - 01:03:10] rules that his office complies
[01:03:10 - 01:03:12] with within the law all
[01:03:12 - 01:03:14] of that has happened the
[01:03:14 - 01:03:14] bid has been evaluated by
[01:03:16 - 01:03:16] a committee and then the
[01:03:16 - 01:03:18] best choice made it's a
[01:03:18 - 01:03:21] very rigorous so i don't
[01:03:21 - 01:03:21] i don't think we've had
[01:03:24 - 01:03:24] problems in that you know
[01:03:24 - 01:03:26] with the bidding process maybe
[01:03:26 - 01:03:30] many many years ago there
[01:03:30 - 01:03:33] were some issues back that
[01:03:33 - 01:03:36] was the judges he was
[01:03:36 - 01:03:38] here but i'm i'm comfortable
[01:03:38 - 01:03:41] with the you know with
[01:03:41 - 01:03:41] moving it to a 100
[01:03:41 - 01:03:41] and as and know with
[01:03:42 - 01:03:42] moving it to a 100
[01:03:42 - 01:03:42] and as and then then
[01:03:44 - 01:03:44] i think they did because
[01:03:44 - 01:03:46] of inflation and the cost
[01:03:46 - 01:03:47] of stuff going up i
[01:03:47 - 01:03:49] think that's actually and they've
[01:03:49 - 01:03:49] done it from 2009 i'm
[01:03:51 - 01:03:51] surprised they didn't go higher
[01:03:52 - 01:03:52] and surprised they didn't go
[01:03:52 - 01:03:54] higher and then then i
[01:03:54 - 01:03:54] don't have any problem with
[01:03:54 - 01:03:57] 100 000 100 000 and
[01:03:57 - 01:03:59] then getting an information piece
[01:03:59 - 01:04:02] just you know a routine
[01:04:02 - 01:04:05] information at a board meeting
[01:04:05 - 01:04:06] but not necessarily at a
[01:04:07 - 01:04:09] board meeting but not necessarily
[01:04:09 - 01:04:12] 20 we have this i
[01:04:12 - 01:04:19] notic you get several contractors
[01:04:19 - 01:04:21] we we get a lot
[01:04:21 - 01:04:21] of contractors no no but
[01:04:21 - 01:04:24] let's say you were going
[01:04:24 - 01:04:24] to bid like the air
[01:04:26 - 01:04:29] quite a few bids for
[01:04:29 - 01:04:29] for for that type of
[01:04:29 - 01:04:33] work uh we pre-approved a
[01:04:33 - 01:04:35] large pool of contractors uh
[01:04:35 - 01:04:38] maintenance repair and operation called
[01:04:38 - 01:04:40] the state list august in
[01:04:40 - 01:04:40] july august we bring a
[01:04:40 - 01:04:43] long list of recommend vendors
[01:04:43 - 01:04:46] for your review and then
[01:04:46 - 01:04:46] for each vendor we put
[01:04:46 - 01:04:48] a threshold that we cannot
[01:04:48 - 01:04:51] exceed so that we can
[01:04:51 - 01:04:51] go to them quickly many
[01:04:51 - 01:04:52] times physical plan is working
[01:04:52 - 01:04:54] through physical plan is working
[01:04:54 - 01:04:57] through emergencies emergencies many too
[01:04:57 - 01:05:01] many times um we go
[01:05:01 - 01:05:01] quickly to these vendors and
[01:05:04 - 01:05:04] and they're based upon good
[01:05:04 - 01:05:07] reputation uh purchasing tips notes
[01:05:07 - 01:05:09] on performance so we have
[01:05:09 - 01:05:09] a list that's brought to
[01:05:09 - 01:05:13] you and the threshold that
[01:05:13 - 01:05:13] we go to and the
[01:05:13 - 01:05:14] threshold that we go to
[01:05:14 - 01:05:18] mr mr oh i i
[01:05:18 - 01:05:18] was just we have i
[01:05:18 - 01:05:19] was going back they say
[01:05:19 - 01:05:22] that there's this composite bidding
[01:05:22 - 01:05:22] process that that a group
[01:05:22 - 01:05:25] of how does that come
[01:05:25 - 01:05:28] compared to that doesn't change
[01:05:28 - 01:05:28] with this with this rule
[01:05:28 - 01:05:28] right change with this with
[01:05:28 - 01:05:28] this rule right here here
[01:05:30 - 01:05:30] it does not what what
[01:05:30 - 01:05:31] mr flowers was describing vice
[01:05:31 - 01:05:34] president flores was describing is
[01:05:34 - 01:05:34] exactly um the case um
[01:05:37 - 01:05:37] it's similar we have um
[01:05:37 - 01:05:40] purchasing has a set of
[01:05:40 - 01:05:40] uh of of rules that
[01:05:40 - 01:05:41] they have to follow to
[01:05:42 - 01:05:45] follow yeah yeah and it's
[01:05:45 - 01:05:45] also the one that uh
[01:05:45 - 01:05:48] don't you have that already
[01:05:48 - 01:05:48] uh vetted by region 19
[01:05:49 - 01:05:49] also for also for yes
[01:05:49 - 01:05:53] yes so we have pre-approved
[01:05:53 - 01:05:55] uh cooperatives we have couldn't
[01:05:55 - 01:05:56] remember uh just to give
[01:05:56 - 01:06:01] you an idea the purchasing
[01:06:01 - 01:06:01] procedure is 26 pages long
[01:06:04 - 01:06:06] only could have 27 but
[01:06:06 - 01:06:06] it's a very it's a
[01:06:06 - 01:06:10] very detailed extensive and that
[01:06:10 - 01:06:12] area is is always looking
[01:06:12 - 01:06:16] at the law they're they're
[01:06:16 - 01:06:18] very they're very good at
[01:06:18 - 01:06:20] complying with the letter of
[01:06:20 - 01:06:21] the law very i think
[01:06:21 - 01:06:21] that's why we're so comfortable
[01:06:24 - 01:06:24] with it going to 100
[01:06:24 - 01:06:25] because you know he's such
[01:06:25 - 01:06:27] a the controls they're very
[01:06:27 - 01:06:28] good controls within that area
[01:06:30 - 01:06:30] and you said austin went
[01:06:30 - 01:06:35] all the way to 125
[01:06:35 - 01:06:35] or 115 so we have
[01:06:35 - 01:06:36] that ability to come december
[01:06:36 - 01:06:37] to it's not necessarily this
[01:06:37 - 01:06:38] threshold this threshold correct correct
[01:06:42 - 01:06:45] so so so that's just
[01:06:45 - 01:06:45] for discussion just for so
[01:06:45 - 01:06:45] that's just for discussion just
[01:06:46 - 01:06:47] for discussion discussion but i
[01:06:47 - 01:06:47] think most of us are
[01:06:47 - 01:06:50] comfortable with 100 when it
[01:06:50 - 01:06:50] comes to decision with 100
[01:06:50 - 01:06:51] when it comes to decision
[01:06:51 - 01:07:01] making making so um mr
[01:07:01 - 01:07:01] here is the financial aid
[01:07:05 - 01:07:05] transfer uh additional revenue that
[01:07:09 - 01:07:09] we're projecting and uh th
[01:07:09 - 01:07:10] this one we're projecting and
[01:07:10 - 01:07:11] uh th this one here
[01:07:11 - 01:07:13] here um we know it's
[01:07:13 - 01:07:16] going to change because by
[01:07:16 - 01:07:16] this point last year we
[01:07:16 - 01:07:19] had received part of this
[01:07:19 - 01:07:19] funding this year we have
[01:07:22 - 01:07:22] not received usually we we
[01:07:22 - 01:07:26] are funded by semester and
[01:07:26 - 01:07:26] we have not been reimbursed
[01:07:29 - 01:07:29] for our fall or spring
[01:07:29 - 01:07:33] yet so the terminology fast
[01:07:33 - 01:07:35] here is i don't it's
[01:07:35 - 01:07:38] an oxymoron yes it's that
[01:07:38 - 01:07:38] it's that so uh this
[01:07:40 - 01:07:40] number is this projection is
[01:07:40 - 01:07:42] going to change for us
[01:07:42 - 01:07:44] because we we haven't received
[01:07:44 - 01:07:46] the results of the information
[01:07:46 - 01:07:48] we reported for the fall
[01:07:48 - 01:07:48] and spring so that will
[01:07:48 - 01:07:50] be adjusted in the next
[01:07:50 - 01:07:52] presentation this is the best
[01:07:52 - 01:07:56] information we have now what
[01:07:56 - 01:07:56] we do know is the
[01:07:56 - 01:07:58] rate for semester credit hour
[01:07:58 - 01:07:58] is going to increase from
[01:07:58 - 01:07:59] credit hour is going to
[01:08:00 - 01:08:01] increase from 56 87 56
[01:08:01 - 01:08:03] 87 for semester credit hour
[01:08:03 - 01:08:07] for dual credit or college
[01:08:07 - 01:08:12] student to 58 52 this
[01:08:12 - 01:08:12] projection of 5 4 million
[01:08:12 - 01:08:15] is basically from information we
[01:08:15 - 01:08:17] did uh in 2024 because
[01:08:17 - 01:08:17] we haven't gotten to 25
[01:08:19 - 01:08:22] information so um it is
[01:08:22 - 01:08:22] going to change but we're
[01:08:22 - 01:08:25] still awaiting payments for the
[01:08:25 - 01:08:26] current so this is the
[01:08:26 - 01:08:29] other part of our appropriation
[01:08:29 - 01:08:29] number that we have in
[01:08:29 - 01:08:29] our appropriation number that we
[01:08:30 - 01:08:31] have in our projection projection
[01:08:33 - 01:08:33] under benefits we know the
[01:08:33 - 01:08:35] state is increasing health insurance
[01:08:35 - 01:08:37] rates by four by 8
[01:08:41 - 01:08:41] and so uh another of
[01:08:41 - 01:08:43] the must be funded items
[01:08:43 - 01:08:43] you're going to see is
[01:08:43 - 01:08:47] related to this 8 increase
[01:08:47 - 01:08:50] in health insurance and dental
[01:08:50 - 01:08:50] insurance so we are asking
[01:08:50 - 01:08:53] for an additional 450 000
[01:08:54 - 01:08:54] supplement our budget for health
[01:08:58 - 01:08:58] insurance and then um insurance
[01:08:58 - 01:08:59] and then um 25 25
[01:09:02 - 01:09:02] for the dental indemnity it's
[01:09:02 - 01:09:05] because of the state increasing
[01:09:05 - 01:09:08] that rate now what we
[01:09:08 - 01:09:08] haven't seen yet uh so
[01:09:08 - 01:09:11] we we fund 50 of
[01:09:11 - 01:09:13] the health insurance costs and
[01:09:13 - 01:09:13] we receive an appropriation from
[01:09:13 - 01:09:15] the state for the other
[01:09:15 - 01:09:15] half of about state for
[01:09:16 - 01:09:16] the other half of about
[01:09:17 - 01:09:17] 7 3 000 7 3
[01:09:17 - 01:09:19] 000 we don't know what
[01:09:19 - 01:09:21] the new appropriation is yet
[01:09:21 - 01:09:21] we're still waiting for that
[01:09:25 - 01:09:25] appropriation amount to know usually
[01:09:26 - 01:09:26] the state increases their appropriation
[01:09:29 - 01:09:29] for their 50 we don't
[01:09:29 - 01:09:31] know what that number is
[01:09:31 - 01:09:34] yet so these are other
[01:09:34 - 01:09:36] things impacting our budget development
[01:09:36 - 01:09:38] on trs we don't expect
[01:09:38 - 01:09:38] a change in the competition
[01:09:38 - 01:09:39] yes expect a change in
[01:09:39 - 01:09:39] the competition yes sir sir
[01:09:41 - 01:09:41] so funding funding for education
[01:09:42 - 01:09:44] at state level is is
[01:09:44 - 01:09:46] separate for the community college
[01:09:46 - 01:09:49] than in four-year college than
[01:09:49 - 01:09:52] k12 education that's correct but
[01:09:52 - 01:09:52] for health care and stuff
[01:09:52 - 01:09:55] like that do they coordinate
[01:09:55 - 01:09:58] the whole thing so we're
[01:09:58 - 01:09:58] competitive with utp on health
[01:10:00 - 01:10:00] benefits or something not competitive
[01:10:02 - 01:10:02] but we're not they have
[01:10:02 - 01:10:04] to negotiate theirs at four-year
[01:10:04 - 01:10:06] level and we negotiate as
[01:10:06 - 01:10:07] community colleges and that kind
[01:10:07 - 01:10:09] of thing well the way
[01:10:09 - 01:10:10] the state funds each of
[01:10:12 - 01:10:12] those respective sectors is different
[01:10:12 - 01:10:12] those respective sectors is different
[01:10:12 - 01:10:13] okay okay okay yeah yeah
[01:10:16 - 01:10:16] they can't even agree on
[01:10:16 - 01:10:19] that they can't even agree
[01:10:20 - 01:10:27] on that no so towards
[01:10:27 - 01:10:30] developing the 2526 budget uh
[01:10:30 - 01:10:30] these are the projected revenues
[01:10:34 - 01:10:36] for 2526 um the first
[01:10:36 - 01:10:36] column we compare them to
[01:10:39 - 01:10:39] the current adopted budget revenues
[01:10:39 - 01:10:43] that we have as a
[01:10:43 - 01:10:46] basis for comparison in the
[01:10:46 - 01:10:46] middle column those are the
[01:10:46 - 01:10:49] revenues we're projecting for next
[01:10:49 - 01:10:54] year so um for for
[01:10:54 - 01:10:57] appropriation we're projecting 49 5
[01:10:57 - 01:10:58] we're projecting 49 5 million
[01:10:58 - 01:11:01] million in appropriation that is
[01:11:01 - 01:11:03] the foundation appropriation along with
[01:11:03 - 01:11:04] the past appropriation along with
[01:11:04 - 01:11:05] the past 49 6 49
[01:11:05 - 01:11:09] 6 that's an increase of
[01:11:09 - 01:11:09] 5 4 million that's an
[01:11:09 - 01:11:11] increase of 5 4 million
[01:11:11 - 01:11:15] 12 3 12 3 uh
[01:11:15 - 01:11:15] overhead recovery for the reasons
[01:11:17 - 01:11:17] where this discussion was on
[01:11:17 - 01:11:20] overhead recovery grants we're forecasting
[01:11:20 - 01:11:23] a decrease for that but
[01:11:23 - 01:11:25] that's a changing number still
[01:11:25 - 01:11:25] we're as dr sata said
[01:11:26 - 01:11:29] the federal environment is changing
[01:11:29 - 01:11:32] so that impacts our projections
[01:11:32 - 01:11:35] so if they take the
[01:11:35 - 01:11:35] cap off of the nsf
[01:11:35 - 01:11:37] funds then our projection may
[01:11:37 - 01:11:37] go up a little bit
[01:11:37 - 01:11:40] or if they make the
[01:11:40 - 01:11:42] capuh restrictive then we'll bring
[01:11:42 - 01:11:44] in less overhead recovery so
[01:11:44 - 01:11:46] we're subject to the whims
[01:11:46 - 01:11:46] of the state and the
[01:11:46 - 01:11:48] federal government on overhead recovery
[01:11:51 - 01:11:51] okay so the 10 two
[01:11:51 - 01:11:54] is what each each vice
[01:11:54 - 01:11:54] president gets to take a
[01:11:54 - 01:11:57] chunk of and salary increase
[01:11:57 - 01:11:59] that comes out of the
[01:11:59 - 01:12:01] 10 million out of the
[01:12:01 - 01:12:04] i'm sorry well if you
[01:12:04 - 01:12:04] take our last year budget
[01:12:05 - 01:12:05] and this year budget that
[01:12:05 - 01:12:06] you're and this year budget
[01:12:06 - 01:12:09] that you're projecting projecting oh
[01:12:09 - 01:12:09] i see yes that tip
[01:12:09 - 01:12:11] two is the whatever the
[01:12:11 - 01:12:14] vice presidents decide they need
[01:12:14 - 01:12:14] in each one of their
[01:12:14 - 01:12:16] divisions in salaries and in
[01:12:17 - 01:12:20] salaries and supplies huh huh
[01:12:23 - 01:12:23] the board determines our salary
[01:12:24 - 01:12:24] well it's part of the
[01:12:24 - 01:12:25] deal we got we got
[01:12:25 - 01:12:28] to cover it but if
[01:12:28 - 01:12:28] you can be absent we
[01:12:28 - 01:12:32] won't have to cut anybody's
[01:12:32 - 01:12:33] salary but that that's that's
[01:12:33 - 01:12:34] the i can guarantee you
[01:12:34 - 01:12:37] we're not going to decrease
[01:12:37 - 01:12:38] anybody's but salary that's what
[01:12:38 - 01:12:40] we're looking at judge that's
[01:12:40 - 01:12:40] that's what we have available
[01:12:40 - 01:12:42] to us as we continue
[01:12:42 - 01:12:43] to move forward and project
[01:12:43 - 01:12:45] the budget 10 2 is
[01:12:45 - 01:12:45] what we have to work
[01:12:45 - 01:12:47] with that's correct that's all
[01:12:47 - 01:12:49] i want based on the
[01:12:49 - 01:12:51] base budget based on the
[01:12:51 - 01:12:56] base budget okay so moving
[01:12:56 - 01:12:56] to the revenue projections for
[01:12:59 - 01:12:59] local funds on the tuition
[01:12:59 - 01:13:01] and fees line item you
[01:13:01 - 01:13:01] see uh projected tuition and
[01:13:06 - 01:13:06] fees of 42 5 million
[01:13:06 - 01:13:08] that's based upon the enrollment
[01:13:08 - 01:13:12] in the current year we're
[01:13:12 - 01:13:12] budgeting that flat um and
[01:13:12 - 01:13:15] so that results in additional
[01:13:15 - 01:13:19] revenue of 3 4 million
[01:13:19 - 01:13:21] increase of 8 7 to
[01:13:21 - 01:13:21] that line item and then
[01:13:21 - 01:13:25] property tax revenue uh that
[01:13:25 - 01:13:25] reflects the tax on new
[01:13:29 - 01:13:29] property the 1 666 666
[01:13:32 - 01:13:32] uh million dollars that's the
[01:13:32 - 01:13:34] what we we will receive
[01:13:34 - 01:13:37] from new property that's a
[01:13:37 - 01:13:38] nice increase uh other income
[01:13:40 - 01:13:40] um based when we did
[01:13:40 - 01:13:42] this projection on interest income
[01:13:42 - 01:13:44] the market was very different
[01:13:44 - 01:13:44] the market the fed said
[01:13:44 - 01:13:47] we're going to cut two
[01:13:47 - 01:13:47] times and then rates at
[01:13:48 - 01:13:48] the end of year going
[01:13:48 - 01:13:48] to be at two and
[01:13:48 - 01:13:51] a quarter now things turn
[01:13:51 - 01:13:52] the other way the fed
[01:13:52 - 01:13:52] did not cut and they're
[01:13:55 - 01:13:55] signaling no more cuts so
[01:13:55 - 01:13:58] it's really difficult to project
[01:13:58 - 01:14:00] out uh interest income what
[01:14:00 - 01:14:00] we do is we take
[01:14:00 - 01:14:01] a very conservative number 5
[01:14:01 - 01:14:04] million we're going to keep
[01:14:04 - 01:14:07] it again so uh that
[01:14:07 - 01:14:07] we we don't think will
[01:14:07 - 01:14:09] go under 5 million so
[01:14:09 - 01:14:13] that number is sustainable for
[01:14:13 - 01:14:17] us um so then the
[01:14:17 - 01:14:17] subtotal for projected so then
[01:14:18 - 01:14:19] the subtotal for projected revenues
[01:14:19 - 01:14:23] revenues is 173 7 million
[01:14:23 - 01:14:23] when we add is 173
[01:14:23 - 01:14:24] 7 million when we add
[01:14:24 - 01:14:27] self-supporting self-supporting projected revenues of
[01:14:27 - 01:14:30] three million the total projected
[01:14:30 - 01:14:32] revenues for 2526 are 176
[01:14:32 - 01:14:37] 7 million that's going to
[01:14:37 - 01:14:40] be the budget for next
[01:14:40 - 01:14:40] year because we cannot exceed
[01:14:43 - 01:14:46] that uh that amount so
[01:14:46 - 01:14:46] that's an increase from the
[01:14:46 - 01:14:49] current adopted budget of 166
[01:14:49 - 01:14:51] 4 million compared to what's
[01:14:51 - 01:14:51] projected so it's going to
[01:14:54 - 01:14:54] be a positive variance of
[01:14:54 - 01:14:57] 10 5 million or an
[01:14:57 - 01:14:57] increase of 6 16 of
[01:14:57 - 01:14:59] projected or an increase of
[01:15:00 - 01:15:03] 6 16 of projected revenues
[01:15:06 - 01:15:06] so now we see those
[01:15:06 - 01:15:09] projected revenues if we were
[01:15:09 - 01:15:09] to um disagregate them and
[01:15:11 - 01:15:11] show them by type uh
[01:15:11 - 01:15:14] property tax revenues expressed as
[01:15:14 - 01:15:18] a percentage is 42 2
[01:15:18 - 01:15:18] 2 of the total uh
[01:15:18 - 01:15:20] projected operating budget followed by
[01:15:20 - 01:15:21] operating budget followed by appropriations
[01:15:21 - 01:15:25] appropriations 49 5 million 28
[01:15:25 - 01:15:31] followed by tuition and fees
[01:15:31 - 01:15:31] 42 5 or 24 followed
[01:15:31 - 01:15:34] by other income which is
[01:15:34 - 01:15:36] interest and followed by self-supporting
[01:15:36 - 01:15:40] and overhead recovery that will
[01:15:40 - 01:15:42] comprise the projected uh budget
[01:15:42 - 01:15:42] for next year and that's
[01:15:42 - 01:15:49] how the so now we
[01:15:49 - 01:15:49] look at the baseline budget
[01:15:50 - 01:15:50] this is this is all
[01:15:50 - 01:15:53] the submissions from the executive
[01:15:53 - 01:15:53] level this is what the
[01:15:56 - 01:15:56] budget office did uh in
[01:15:56 - 01:15:58] the may time period taking
[01:15:58 - 01:16:00] all the submissions from the
[01:16:00 - 01:16:00] executive levels and compiling a
[01:16:03 - 01:16:03] baseline budget based upon what
[01:16:03 - 01:16:06] they submitted so that middle
[01:16:06 - 01:16:10] column is the baseline budget
[01:16:10 - 01:16:10] and you see by executive
[01:16:13 - 01:16:13] level area what those projected
[01:16:13 - 01:16:17] budgets are that they're requesting
[01:16:17 - 01:16:20] and so um it comes
[01:16:20 - 01:16:20] to 162 4 it comes
[01:16:20 - 01:16:21] to 162 4 million million
[01:16:24 - 01:16:24] compared to the adopted current
[01:16:24 - 01:16:30] budget of 163 4 that's
[01:16:30 - 01:16:30] a decrease of 1 million
[01:16:32 - 01:16:32] there's a couple of variances
[01:16:32 - 01:16:35] that are large in here
[01:16:35 - 01:16:35] if you look at the
[01:16:35 - 01:16:39] uh 1 2 million uh
[01:16:39 - 01:16:39] decrease there but you see
[01:16:39 - 01:16:42] an increase in the line
[01:16:42 - 01:16:44] item row below that's because
[01:16:44 - 01:16:47] in the instructional area they
[01:16:47 - 01:16:49] did some reallocation they moved
[01:16:49 - 01:16:49] some programs from one area
[01:16:49 - 01:16:51] to another so the area
[01:16:51 - 01:16:53] they're going into is an
[01:16:53 - 01:16:53] increase the area they're coming
[01:16:56 - 01:16:56] from is a is a
[01:16:56 - 01:16:58] decrease so um the workforce
[01:16:58 - 01:17:01] and continuing education decreased by
[01:17:01 - 01:17:01] 1 2 million however those
[01:17:05 - 01:17:05] areas moved over to um
[01:17:05 - 01:17:07] workforce instruction and workforce education
[01:17:07 - 01:17:08] instruction and workforce education 616
[01:17:08 - 01:17:11] 000 616 000 this reflects
[01:17:11 - 01:17:13] the movement of position vacant
[01:17:13 - 01:17:13] positions and filling them at
[01:17:16 - 01:17:16] lower levels this re this
[01:17:16 - 01:17:19] reflects the movement of positions
[01:17:19 - 01:17:22] largely this will continue to
[01:17:22 - 01:17:22] move all the way through
[01:17:25 - 01:17:28] august the 31st this is
[01:17:28 - 01:17:28] a baseline budget as of
[01:17:28 - 01:17:32] may 31st laura's team will
[01:17:32 - 01:17:35] continue to work on adjusting
[01:17:35 - 01:17:35] the baseline budget all the
[01:17:38 - 01:17:42] way through august 31st so
[01:17:42 - 01:17:42] um this this is the
[01:17:42 - 01:17:44] baseline budget as we project
[01:17:47 - 01:17:47] and so when you add
[01:17:47 - 01:17:50] in the self-supporting accounts down
[01:17:50 - 01:17:52] here totaling 3 million we're
[01:17:52 - 01:17:56] looking at a baseline budget
[01:17:56 - 01:17:58] of 165 5 million compared
[01:17:58 - 01:18:02] to the current operating budget
[01:18:02 - 01:18:04] of 166 5 basically down
[01:18:04 - 01:18:04] a million dollars yes basically
[01:18:04 - 01:18:05] down a million dollars yes
[01:18:05 - 01:18:07] sir sir i'm just looking
[01:18:07 - 01:18:07] so so you had a
[01:18:11 - 01:18:11] million2 and you get 66
[01:18:11 - 01:18:14] still 602 000 and you
[01:18:14 - 01:18:14] add to that the 278
[01:18:14 - 01:18:17] 000 it's almost 900 000
[01:18:17 - 01:18:19] that you're taking out of
[01:18:19 - 01:18:19] that which is essentially the
[01:18:19 - 01:18:21] bottom line everything else balances
[01:18:21 - 01:18:24] out where did the other
[01:18:24 - 01:18:27] i mean how come you
[01:18:27 - 01:18:27] lost 600 000 in workforce
[01:18:29 - 01:18:29] and somebody's not complaining about
[01:18:29 - 01:18:32] i lost you know oh
[01:18:32 - 01:18:32] we gave you 600 000
[01:18:35 - 01:18:35] back no you lost you
[01:18:35 - 01:18:38] lost 600 and you lost
[01:18:38 - 01:18:38] almost 300 000 out of
[01:18:38 - 01:18:40] finance who gave that up
[01:18:40 - 01:18:43] and what so in finance
[01:18:43 - 01:18:43] the 278 000 so in
[01:18:43 - 01:18:44] finance the 278 000 yeah
[01:18:44 - 01:18:46] yeah so we we maintain
[01:18:46 - 01:18:49] we maintain a clearing account
[01:18:49 - 01:18:49] that clearing account uh is
[01:18:49 - 01:18:52] an account is used to
[01:18:52 - 01:18:54] fund um other activities that
[01:18:54 - 01:18:57] that weren't originally budgeted so
[01:18:57 - 01:18:57] if somebody says you know
[01:18:57 - 01:18:59] i really need to buy
[01:18:59 - 01:19:02] this software i need this
[01:19:02 - 01:19:02] uh item purchase it's not
[01:19:02 - 01:19:05] in my budget the budget
[01:19:05 - 01:19:08] the finance area the finance
[01:19:08 - 01:19:11] area will um do a
[01:19:11 - 01:19:13] transfer from the clearing account
[01:19:13 - 01:19:13] out so that's a negative
[01:19:15 - 01:19:15] so you're just saying supplementing
[01:19:15 - 01:19:16] it you're saying is next
[01:19:16 - 01:19:19] year i just don't need
[01:19:19 - 01:19:19] 300 000 as much as
[01:19:19 - 01:19:19] i did last need 300
[01:19:19 - 01:19:20] 000 as much as i
[01:19:20 - 01:19:20] did last year year year
[01:19:23 - 01:19:23] yes yes yes okay okay
[01:19:25 - 01:19:25] so that's the movement i
[01:19:25 - 01:19:27] understand that it's just that
[01:19:27 - 01:19:29] all of a sudden somebody
[01:19:29 - 01:19:29] says it's strange see i
[01:19:32 - 01:19:32] just don't need that much
[01:19:32 - 01:19:34] money and it seems like
[01:19:34 - 01:19:38] workforce and continue education still
[01:19:38 - 01:19:38] is if if you see
[01:19:38 - 01:19:41] i gave 600 000 to
[01:19:41 - 01:19:45] instruction in workforce yeah well
[01:19:45 - 01:19:46] workforce continuing yeah well workforce
[01:19:46 - 01:19:47] continuing 62 000 62 000
[01:19:48 - 01:19:49] and so okay if they
[01:19:49 - 01:19:49] think they need a better
[01:19:49 - 01:19:51] job with less well that's
[01:19:51 - 01:19:53] good with less well that's
[01:19:54 - 01:19:57] good yes okay a lot
[01:19:57 - 01:19:57] of these are also based
[01:19:57 - 01:19:59] on retirements mr oxen so
[01:19:59 - 01:20:01] you have a faculty position
[01:20:01 - 01:20:02] that's been in the position
[01:20:02 - 01:20:02] for a number of years
[01:20:02 - 01:20:05] we're recognized at our board
[01:20:05 - 01:20:07] meeting um russ meyers who's
[01:20:07 - 01:20:09] a great faculty member has
[01:20:09 - 01:20:11] been with the institution for
[01:20:11 - 01:20:11] a significant period of time
[01:20:11 - 01:20:14] his wage has increased every
[01:20:14 - 01:20:16] year and when he retires
[01:20:16 - 01:20:16] we're able to hire a
[01:20:16 - 01:20:17] faculty member at a starting
[01:20:17 - 01:20:20] wage say 600 000 well
[01:20:20 - 01:20:24] depending on how many how
[01:20:24 - 01:20:24] many um retire theoretically we
[01:20:24 - 01:20:24] many how many um retire
[01:20:24 - 01:20:24] theoretically we could could could
[01:20:29 - 01:20:31] absolutely it's just good that
[01:20:31 - 01:20:33] you can see people net
[01:20:33 - 01:20:33] effect hey i can do
[01:20:33 - 01:20:37] a better job next year
[01:20:37 - 01:20:37] i can do as good
[01:20:37 - 01:20:39] a job this year as
[01:20:39 - 01:20:39] i did last year as
[01:20:39 - 01:20:41] less money that's it's all
[01:20:41 - 01:20:43] right particularly considering inflation go
[01:20:43 - 01:20:45] up 33 mr don't mind
[01:20:45 - 01:20:45] me jumping in a lot
[01:20:45 - 01:20:50] of that 616 000 is
[01:20:50 - 01:20:50] reflects the movement of the
[01:20:50 - 01:20:54] law enforcement academy from adp
[01:20:54 - 01:20:55] area to enforcement academy from
[01:20:56 - 01:20:59] adp area to josh but
[01:20:59 - 01:20:59] your point is well taken
[01:21:02 - 01:21:02] yeah i still i don't
[01:21:02 - 01:21:05] you move it but you
[01:21:05 - 01:21:10] still somebody's somebody's coming up
[01:21:10 - 01:21:10] with 62 000 less so
[01:21:13 - 01:21:13] um another so doing more
[01:21:13 - 01:21:15] with less we did eliminate
[01:21:15 - 01:21:18] some duplication so we had
[01:21:18 - 01:21:18] two offices running very similar
[01:21:20 - 01:21:20] customized training and grants and
[01:21:22 - 01:21:22] realized with the retirement of
[01:21:22 - 01:21:24] one of the directors we
[01:21:24 - 01:21:27] could merge those two offices
[01:21:27 - 01:21:27] into one director and so
[01:21:27 - 01:21:29] that's some of the savings
[01:21:29 - 01:21:32] there as well i'm not
[01:21:32 - 01:21:32] telling you that you know
[01:21:33 - 01:21:33] somebody sneaky would go back
[01:21:33 - 01:21:37] and justify having two offices
[01:21:37 - 01:21:39] and argue that you don't
[01:21:39 - 01:21:39] need to give up 600
[01:21:39 - 01:21:41] i think you did a
[01:21:41 - 01:21:44] good job myself i would
[01:21:44 - 01:21:44] try to hide that second
[01:21:44 - 01:21:46] office and see if i
[01:21:46 - 01:21:48] can so it's if i
[01:21:48 - 01:21:48] think your your point is
[01:21:50 - 01:21:50] extremely well taken mr herster
[01:21:50 - 01:21:52] given the fact that you'll
[01:21:52 - 01:21:55] see slightly later in in
[01:21:55 - 01:21:57] um vice president flores's presentation
[01:21:57 - 01:21:57] that we're going to make
[01:22:01 - 01:22:01] some adjustments because so when
[01:22:01 - 01:22:05] we do a salary enhancement
[01:22:05 - 01:22:07] for our faculty we say
[01:22:07 - 01:22:07] a portion is going towards
[01:22:07 - 01:22:09] the table and a portion
[01:22:09 - 01:22:11] is going towards a theoretic
[01:22:11 - 01:22:13] raise the employee the faculty
[01:22:13 - 01:22:13] member receives all of it
[01:22:13 - 01:22:15] but we adjust the table
[01:22:15 - 01:22:18] and we we've never done
[01:22:18 - 01:22:18] that on the staff side
[01:22:18 - 01:22:19] and that's part of the
[01:22:19 - 01:22:21] reason some of those vacancies
[01:22:21 - 01:22:21] are still vacant is because
[01:22:23 - 01:22:23] we're having a harder time
[01:22:23 - 01:22:25] competing for staff particularly at
[01:22:25 - 01:22:27] lower levels of the institution
[01:22:27 - 01:22:27] or starting pay and so
[01:22:29 - 01:22:29] what i've asked the staff
[01:22:29 - 01:22:32] to do is to make
[01:22:32 - 01:22:32] according adjustments to tables for
[01:22:35 - 01:22:35] staff so that in the
[01:22:35 - 01:22:37] future we won't have the
[01:22:37 - 01:22:40] same challenge so you're saying
[01:22:40 - 01:22:40] it's all i's fault that
[01:22:42 - 01:22:42] no i'm saying that that
[01:22:42 - 01:22:44] um in the past it
[01:22:44 - 01:22:44] wasn't just something that we
[01:22:44 - 01:22:46] did and i've asked um
[01:22:46 - 01:22:49] uh vice president flores and
[01:22:49 - 01:22:49] ap field to work on
[01:22:49 - 01:22:51] that for us so that
[01:22:51 - 01:22:51] we don't have as hard
[01:22:51 - 01:22:52] a time recruiting so you're
[01:22:52 - 01:22:54] going to see a significant
[01:22:54 - 01:22:58] number probably in the 600
[01:22:58 - 01:22:58] 000 range um that is
[01:22:58 - 01:23:00] going to be an adjustment
[01:23:00 - 01:23:00] to tables so that in
[01:23:00 - 01:23:03] the future we won't have
[01:23:03 - 01:23:03] 10 million of future we
[01:23:03 - 01:23:03] won't have 10 million of
[01:23:03 - 01:23:08] vacancies vacancies okay that's good
[01:23:10 - 01:23:10] i still would hide that
[01:23:10 - 01:23:11] second office it's a good
[01:23:11 - 01:23:14] thing you're not running that
[01:23:14 - 01:23:16] program it would be fully
[01:23:16 - 01:23:27] justified i can make so
[01:23:27 - 01:23:27] now we look at the
[01:23:27 - 01:23:28] baseline budget when you break
[01:23:28 - 01:23:32] it out by functional area
[01:23:32 - 01:23:32] this is what it looks
[01:23:32 - 01:23:35] like um in this particular
[01:23:35 - 01:23:39] case uh instruction is uh
[01:23:39 - 01:23:39] still at 54 8 uh
[01:23:39 - 01:23:41] still at 54 8 million
[01:23:41 - 01:23:44] million right here representing 33
[01:23:44 - 01:23:47] of the budget uh followed
[01:23:47 - 01:23:51] by institutional support over here
[01:23:51 - 01:23:54] at 50 million uh interestingly
[01:23:54 - 01:23:58] enough when you combine instruction
[01:23:58 - 01:23:59] with academic combine instruction with
[01:23:59 - 01:24:02] academic support support uh that
[01:24:02 - 01:24:02] represents like 44 of the
[01:24:04 - 01:24:04] budget and that's the way
[01:24:04 - 01:24:08] it should be uh supporting
[01:24:08 - 01:24:08] students and when you add
[01:24:10 - 01:24:10] uh student services to that
[01:24:10 - 01:24:13] you're close to over 50
[01:24:13 - 01:24:13] of the budget going to
[01:24:15 - 01:24:18] supporting students so you see
[01:24:18 - 01:24:18] how uh the allocation of
[01:24:21 - 01:24:25] budgets is um additionally in
[01:24:25 - 01:24:25] here you have uh as
[01:24:28 - 01:24:28] part of the 165 4
[01:24:28 - 01:24:31] 4 million baseline budget 20
[01:24:31 - 01:24:36] million is dedicated to academic
[01:24:36 - 01:24:36] support and also um physical
[01:24:41 - 01:24:41] plant 13 2 million student
[01:24:41 - 01:24:45] services 122 million uh public
[01:24:45 - 01:24:49] service 3 8 uh research
[01:24:49 - 01:24:52] 214 000 um over here
[01:24:52 - 01:24:56] and then self-supporting one 3
[01:24:56 - 01:24:56] million transfers of 7 5
[01:24:59 - 01:24:59] million so that is how
[01:24:59 - 01:24:59] by functional million so that
[01:25:00 - 01:25:01] is how by functional area
[01:25:01 - 01:25:02] area the baseline budget would
[01:25:02 - 01:25:05] be the baseline budget would
[01:25:06 - 01:25:09] be distributed if we look
[01:25:09 - 01:25:09] at that same baseline budget
[01:25:12 - 01:25:17] by expense category um then
[01:25:17 - 01:25:17] you look at uh it
[01:25:17 - 01:25:19] going like 73 to salaries
[01:25:19 - 01:25:24] when you consider faculty salaries
[01:25:24 - 01:25:24] of 56 4 56 5
[01:25:24 - 01:25:28] million and then you have
[01:25:28 - 01:25:28] staff salaries of 50 million
[01:25:30 - 01:25:30] and then you have benefits
[01:25:30 - 01:25:33] of 8 and a half
[01:25:33 - 01:25:33] million uh over 70 of
[01:25:33 - 01:25:38] the budget goes to staff
[01:25:38 - 01:25:40] salaries and faculty the rest
[01:25:40 - 01:25:40] of it is distributed to
[01:25:44 - 01:25:44] supplies 28 million transfer 7
[01:25:44 - 01:25:47] 5 a small amount to
[01:25:47 - 01:25:47] travel 1 3 equipment a
[01:25:47 - 01:25:48] small amount to travel 1
[01:25:48 - 01:25:49] 3 equipment 1 1 1
[01:25:49 - 01:25:52] 1 uh and then contingency
[01:25:52 - 01:25:56] up here 6 5 million
[01:25:56 - 01:25:56] this contains a bianium reserve
[01:25:57 - 01:25:57] in case appropriations do not
[01:25:58 - 01:26:00] come through uh something happens
[01:26:00 - 01:26:01] at the state level and
[01:26:01 - 01:26:04] they cut funding on something
[01:26:04 - 01:26:04] this is just in case
[01:26:04 - 01:26:07] uh that is mitigating the
[01:26:07 - 01:26:10] risk in budget development by
[01:26:10 - 01:26:13] doing that so this is
[01:26:13 - 01:26:13] how by expense category the
[01:26:16 - 01:26:16] baseline budget uh which is
[01:26:16 - 01:26:21] the starting point for uh
[01:26:21 - 01:26:21] for the budget for the
[01:26:21 - 01:26:23] year is broken down now
[01:26:23 - 01:26:26] these are the additional funding
[01:26:26 - 01:26:26] requests this is additional funding
[01:26:26 - 01:26:27] requests this is preliminary preliminary
[01:26:30 - 01:26:30] and so it's broken down
[01:26:30 - 01:26:32] into two categories the critical
[01:26:32 - 01:26:35] needs um those are must
[01:26:35 - 01:26:37] be funded items central appraisal
[01:26:37 - 01:26:39] district has raised their budget
[01:26:39 - 01:26:39] they pass on the prorated
[01:26:41 - 01:26:41] share to the different taxing
[01:26:41 - 01:26:46] entities our proportionate share is
[01:26:46 - 01:26:51] 69 9 000 uh insurance
[01:26:51 - 01:26:51] rates keep on rising and
[01:26:51 - 01:26:54] so mr raela projects needing
[01:26:54 - 01:26:58] 264 000 more for rising
[01:26:58 - 01:27:01] insurance rates uh we talked
[01:27:01 - 01:27:01] about gazsby 101 the impact
[01:27:01 - 01:27:02] of implementing that it's going
[01:27:02 - 01:27:05] to hit have a hit
[01:27:05 - 01:27:05] of about 200 000 we
[01:27:05 - 01:27:07] talked about the 8 increase
[01:27:07 - 01:27:11] in health insurance uh 450
[01:27:11 - 01:27:14] 000 medicare as in payrolls
[01:27:14 - 01:27:14] go up then the related
[01:27:14 - 01:27:16] uh payroll taxes go up
[01:27:16 - 01:27:20] in this case it's medicare
[01:27:20 - 01:27:20] we're estimating uh 80 000
[01:27:22 - 01:27:22] increase the dental insurance is
[01:27:22 - 01:27:25] also tied to the 8
[01:27:25 - 01:27:28] increase from ers for insurance
[01:27:28 - 01:27:28] rates and then the reserve
[01:27:28 - 01:27:29] for insurance rates and then
[01:27:29 - 01:27:30] the reserve for trsp trsp
[01:27:32 - 01:27:32] uh appropriation so that's the
[01:27:32 - 01:27:34] matching portion that the employer
[01:27:34 - 01:27:37] pays largely trs so we
[01:27:37 - 01:27:39] have more employees our proportionate
[01:27:39 - 01:27:39] share of that is half
[01:27:39 - 01:27:42] of eight and a quarter
[01:27:42 - 01:27:45] so resulting in 210 000
[01:27:45 - 01:27:45] more that we're going to
[01:27:45 - 01:27:47] need um and then it
[01:27:47 - 01:27:49] software some of the contracts
[01:27:49 - 01:27:52] have built-in escalation clauses 10
[01:27:52 - 01:27:52] or 15 so those are
[01:27:54 - 01:27:57] increases related to software maintenance
[01:27:57 - 01:27:57] that are built in to
[01:27:57 - 01:28:00] the contracts so the critical
[01:28:00 - 01:28:01] items total contracts so the
[01:28:01 - 01:28:03] critical items total 1 665
[01:28:03 - 01:28:05] 1 665 000 1 665
[01:28:05 - 01:28:07] 000 you're going to see
[01:28:07 - 01:28:09] that number in just a
[01:28:09 - 01:28:09] little bit on the budget
[01:28:09 - 01:28:12] strategy slide and so these
[01:28:12 - 01:28:14] other funding requests are the
[01:28:14 - 01:28:17] ones that are being vetted
[01:28:17 - 01:28:19] by dr sarata and they're
[01:28:19 - 01:28:24] broken out by executive level
[01:28:24 - 01:28:24] here and those total 2
[01:28:24 - 01:28:27] 4 million at the moment
[01:28:27 - 01:28:27] i i can see where
[01:28:27 - 01:28:30] that 600 000 you saved
[01:28:30 - 01:28:34] me has now been invested
[01:28:34 - 01:28:34] in 1 6 million central
[01:28:34 - 01:28:37] so you saved me 600
[01:28:37 - 01:28:37] 000 and you wanted 1
[01:28:37 - 01:28:37] 6 saved me 600 000
[01:28:38 - 01:28:39] and you wanted 1 6
[01:28:39 - 01:28:44] back back so these are
[01:28:44 - 01:28:46] the additional funding requests and
[01:28:46 - 01:28:49] the two categories within that
[01:28:49 - 01:28:49] category that are being uh
[01:28:49 - 01:28:50] that category that are being
[01:28:51 - 01:28:54] uh considered considered so this
[01:28:54 - 01:28:56] is where everything gets collapsed
[01:28:56 - 01:29:00] together this is one slide
[01:29:00 - 01:29:04] that brings in your projected
[01:29:04 - 01:29:06] revenues of 176 million and
[01:29:06 - 01:29:06] then we just talked about
[01:29:06 - 01:29:10] the baseline budget 165 5
[01:29:10 - 01:29:13] million that yields an initial
[01:29:13 - 01:29:20] budget surplus of now we
[01:29:20 - 01:29:20] just talked about the must
[01:29:20 - 01:29:21] be funded on the additional
[01:29:21 - 01:29:22] funding funded on the additional
[01:29:23 - 01:29:27] funding requests requests of 1
[01:29:27 - 01:29:29] 6 million and so the
[01:29:29 - 01:29:29] next item here is a
[01:29:29 - 01:29:32] 6 adjustment to the salary
[01:29:32 - 01:29:34] tables that dr sarata mentioned
[01:29:34 - 01:29:34] is going to help us
[01:29:38 - 01:29:38] with recruiting and retaining staff
[01:29:38 - 01:29:40] um associate vice president melenna
[01:29:40 - 01:29:45] field and her team have
[01:29:45 - 01:29:45] uh done u a process
[01:29:45 - 01:29:48] to adjust the tables by
[01:29:48 - 01:29:51] 6 and so the impact
[01:29:51 - 01:29:51] of that would be an
[01:29:59 - 01:29:59] i would say that 400
[01:29:59 - 01:30:00] 000 of that uh is
[01:30:03 - 01:30:03] related to uh full-time staff
[01:30:07 - 01:30:07] the other 200 000 of
[01:30:07 - 01:30:10] that number is to bring
[01:30:10 - 01:30:10] anybody making less than 10
[01:30:10 - 01:30:15] an hour up to 10
[01:30:15 - 01:30:15] and that's about 282 hour
[01:30:15 - 01:30:15] up to 10 and that's
[01:30:15 - 01:30:17] about 282 partners partners we
[01:30:17 - 01:30:17] still have people making less
[01:30:17 - 01:30:20] than 10 i thought we
[01:30:20 - 01:30:20] agreed at the last even
[01:30:22 - 01:30:22] when christina was here that
[01:30:22 - 01:30:25] they were going to we've
[01:30:25 - 01:30:25] worked on it dr graham
[01:30:25 - 01:30:27] and we have a good
[01:30:27 - 01:30:27] handle on it at this
[01:30:27 - 01:30:29] point where we believe that
[01:30:29 - 01:30:32] this will cover all employees
[01:30:32 - 01:30:32] uh we had a number
[01:30:32 - 01:30:34] of part-time employees that were
[01:30:34 - 01:30:37] under 10 and then some
[01:30:37 - 01:30:37] of our um uh work
[01:30:37 - 01:30:38] study and then some of
[01:30:39 - 01:30:40] our um uh work study
[01:30:40 - 01:30:48] areas areas it'll impact 125
[01:30:50 - 01:30:50] part- timerrs making less than
[01:30:50 - 01:30:53] 10 an hour and then
[01:30:53 - 01:30:58] on the 6 adjustment it'll
[01:30:58 - 01:30:58] impact 395 part- timerrs uh
[01:31:01 - 01:31:01] impacted by increasing the tables
[01:31:01 - 01:31:07] by 6 so part- timerrs
[01:31:07 - 01:31:07] are about five four 525
[01:31:10 - 01:31:10] part- timerrs will be impacted
[01:31:10 - 01:31:14] by this increase uh there'll
[01:31:14 - 01:31:17] be about 127 full-timers impacted
[01:31:17 - 01:31:19] as if the tables are
[01:31:19 - 01:31:23] increased by 6 and then
[01:31:23 - 01:31:23] um there's about 162 vacant
[01:31:25 - 01:31:25] positions that are in recruitment
[01:31:25 - 01:31:28] that would be impacted as
[01:31:28 - 01:31:31] well so all together uh
[01:31:31 - 01:31:31] the 6 increase is going
[01:31:31 - 01:31:35] to impact uh 463 000
[01:31:37 - 01:31:37] raising the part- timerrs to
[01:31:37 - 01:31:41] 10 up to 10 has
[01:31:41 - 01:31:41] an impact of about 28
[01:31:41 - 01:31:45] 000 all told this uh
[01:31:45 - 01:31:47] increase right here that will
[01:31:47 - 01:31:47] help us recruit and retain
[01:31:52 - 01:31:52] staff uh has a current
[01:31:52 - 01:31:55] value of 672 what i
[01:31:55 - 01:31:55] would tell you is when
[01:31:55 - 01:31:58] this study was done by
[01:31:58 - 01:31:58] the hr by miss field's
[01:31:58 - 01:32:03] hr team um it doesn't
[01:32:03 - 01:32:06] consider if the board does
[01:32:06 - 01:32:07] a salary increase does a
[01:32:07 - 01:32:11] salary increase then then this
[01:32:11 - 01:32:11] table amount will go down
[01:32:13 - 01:32:13] because we did it before
[01:32:13 - 01:32:17] any salary increase so if
[01:32:17 - 01:32:17] you do a 3 increase
[01:32:17 - 01:32:20] as an example for the
[01:32:20 - 01:32:24] next year the 463 000
[01:32:24 - 01:32:24] will probably go down to
[01:32:24 - 01:32:26] the 463 000 will probably
[01:32:26 - 01:32:28] go down to 230 000
[01:32:31 - 01:32:31] so this is this number
[01:32:31 - 01:32:32] here is very preliminary because
[01:32:32 - 01:32:35] we don't know what the
[01:32:35 - 01:32:35] board's going to approve as
[01:32:35 - 01:32:37] an increase but it will
[01:32:37 - 01:32:40] help with retaining and recruiting
[01:32:40 - 01:32:42] staff as dr at mentioned
[01:32:42 - 01:32:42] we have a lot of
[01:32:42 - 01:32:46] positions uh the lower levels
[01:32:46 - 01:32:48] that are making um under
[01:32:48 - 01:32:48] the amount that these tables
[01:32:48 - 01:32:50] would be adjusted to so
[01:32:50 - 01:32:53] they'll see a bump from
[01:32:53 - 01:32:57] that this increase will only
[01:32:57 - 01:33:01] affect one administrative person only
[01:33:01 - 01:33:01] one the majority of the
[01:33:01 - 01:33:04] rest will be classified staff
[01:33:04 - 01:33:07] will be impacted and on
[01:33:07 - 01:33:11] the 10 increase um bring
[01:33:11 - 01:33:11] everybody up to 10 only
[01:33:11 - 01:33:12] three full-timers that were affected
[01:33:12 - 01:33:15] by that all the rest
[01:33:15 - 01:33:15] were part- timerrs so we
[01:33:18 - 01:33:18] we we uh this process
[01:33:18 - 01:33:22] will help align those dollar
[01:33:22 - 01:33:24] values i don't know u
[01:33:24 - 01:33:24] miss field did i leave
[01:33:25 - 01:33:29] anything off no other than
[01:33:29 - 01:33:29] how critical it is that
[01:33:31 - 01:33:31] we adjust the tables because
[01:33:31 - 01:33:35] it's been since 2016 that
[01:33:35 - 01:33:38] we haven't seen any tables
[01:33:38 - 01:33:38] for the employees so it's
[01:33:52 - 01:33:52] so that that has a
[01:33:52 - 01:33:52] value of 672 000 so
[01:33:55 - 01:33:55] the these are kind of
[01:33:55 - 01:33:59] two items that we feel
[01:33:59 - 01:33:59] uh are very important to
[01:33:59 - 01:34:02] uh approve these two increases
[01:34:02 - 01:34:05] and that will still yield
[01:34:05 - 01:34:05] a surplus of 8 9
[01:34:05 - 01:34:08] million and so um you
[01:34:08 - 01:34:08] saw the value of the
[01:34:12 - 01:34:12] additional request at 2 4
[01:34:12 - 01:34:17] million here and so um
[01:34:17 - 01:34:19] that would leave still if
[01:34:19 - 01:34:19] that was funded an amount
[01:34:19 - 01:34:23] to increase the bianium reserve
[01:34:23 - 01:34:23] by 6 5 million now
[01:34:26 - 01:34:26] that's the very basic column
[01:34:26 - 01:34:30] here what you have in
[01:34:30 - 01:34:30] the 1 2 3 up
[01:34:30 - 01:34:33] to 5 scenarios we've added
[01:34:33 - 01:34:37] the value of a salary
[01:34:37 - 01:34:37] enhancement at 1 in case
[01:34:37 - 01:34:39] we wanted to do some
[01:34:39 - 01:34:42] multiples or half of a
[01:34:42 - 01:34:44] percentage you know what 1
[01:34:44 - 01:34:44] is valued at but here
[01:34:44 - 01:34:48] you see the value of
[01:34:48 - 01:34:52] a 2 enhancement 3 so
[01:34:52 - 01:34:52] forth and so on if
[01:34:52 - 01:34:52] we look at the 3
[01:34:55 - 01:34:55] column here what we see
[01:34:55 - 01:34:58] is with a 3 salary
[01:34:58 - 01:34:58] increase which is uh close
[01:34:58 - 01:35:02] to what inflation is um
[01:35:02 - 01:35:05] you still see a surplus
[01:35:05 - 01:35:05] of 3 4 million that
[01:35:05 - 01:35:12] would go to so these
[01:35:12 - 01:35:12] are these are at the
[01:35:12 - 01:35:14] moment with the preliminary numbers
[01:35:14 - 01:35:18] that have been presented to
[01:35:18 - 01:35:18] you um how the outlook
[01:35:27 - 01:35:27] are there any are there
[01:35:27 - 01:35:30] any questions related to this
[01:35:30 - 01:35:37] related to this so so
[01:35:37 - 01:35:37] next we're going to talk
[01:35:37 - 01:35:40] about the 4-year uh financial
[01:35:40 - 01:35:42] model uh it has been
[01:35:42 - 01:35:45] updated and has current numbers
[01:35:45 - 01:35:48] in it uh from last
[01:35:48 - 01:35:48] year and so this model
[01:35:48 - 01:35:51] chooses to analyze future capacity
[01:35:51 - 01:35:54] should we need to raise
[01:35:54 - 01:35:54] something then the model is
[01:35:56 - 01:35:56] available for that if we
[01:35:56 - 01:35:59] wanted to raise uh tuition
[01:35:59 - 01:35:59] and you chose to uh
[01:36:03 - 01:36:03] approve uh uh tuition rates
[01:36:03 - 01:36:06] this model could project that
[01:36:06 - 01:36:06] if you felt the need
[01:36:09 - 01:36:09] to raise property taxes this
[01:36:09 - 01:36:12] model could project that as
[01:36:12 - 01:36:12] well it is a tool
[01:36:15 - 01:36:15] to use in modeling different
[01:36:15 - 01:36:16] budget to use in modeling
[01:36:16 - 01:36:20] different budget scenarios scenarios that
[01:36:20 - 01:36:20] uh might be considered and
[01:36:20 - 01:36:23] so uh it tracks revenue
[01:36:23 - 01:36:25] sources that are trending higher
[01:36:25 - 01:36:28] than in previous years um
[01:36:28 - 01:36:28] enroll if enrollment is growing
[01:36:28 - 01:36:30] it can tell you what
[01:36:30 - 01:36:33] the impact of that might
[01:36:33 - 01:36:33] be if state appropriations are
[01:36:36 - 01:36:36] are growing as well and
[01:36:36 - 01:36:40] there's changes we can model
[01:36:40 - 01:36:40] that also other factors or
[01:36:42 - 01:36:42] assumptions it covers two legislative
[01:36:46 - 01:36:46] periods so it covers four
[01:36:46 - 01:36:49] years in case we need
[01:36:49 - 01:36:49] to do that uh if
[01:36:49 - 01:36:51] you wanted to as i
[01:36:51 - 01:36:51] said tuition increases which are
[01:36:55 - 01:36:55] not uh on discussion or
[01:36:55 - 01:36:58] recommended u and also it
[01:36:58 - 01:37:01] implies steady property valuation increases
[01:37:01 - 01:37:04] and assumes regular salary enhancement
[01:37:07 - 01:37:07] so this is a static
[01:37:07 - 01:37:07] model this is a pdf
[01:37:12 - 01:37:12] of the model and so
[01:37:12 - 01:37:12] um it has a lot
[01:37:12 - 01:37:16] of information in it and
[01:37:16 - 01:37:16] it um has a lot
[01:37:16 - 01:37:19] of pieces to it and
[01:37:19 - 01:37:19] so this is what the
[01:37:22 - 01:37:22] model looks like and then
[01:37:22 - 01:37:27] the second part of this
[01:37:27 - 01:37:27] model shows the impact of
[01:37:29 - 01:37:29] fund balance that's a little
[01:37:29 - 01:37:33] bit dizzying i know but
[01:37:33 - 01:37:35] it's the it's the process
[01:37:35 - 01:37:35] we go through in case
[01:37:35 - 01:37:38] we want to consider increasing
[01:37:38 - 01:37:41] fund balance we maintain a
[01:37:41 - 01:37:41] fund balance of 25 of
[01:37:41 - 01:37:45] fund balance to operating budget
[01:37:45 - 01:37:45] and so those considerations are
[01:37:48 - 01:37:48] in here it considers transfers
[01:37:48 - 01:37:51] to project reserve a lot
[01:37:51 - 01:37:54] of different things so at
[01:37:54 - 01:37:54] this point i don't know
[01:37:57 - 01:37:57] if anybody has any questions
[01:37:57 - 01:38:11] related to um um the
[01:38:11 - 01:38:16] next steps going forward we'll
[01:38:16 - 01:38:16] continue to recruit efforts for
[01:38:19 - 01:38:21] summer and fall registration update
[01:38:21 - 01:38:24] revenue projections with final state
[01:38:24 - 01:38:26] appropriation numbers that might be
[01:38:26 - 01:38:26] provided hopefully we'll get the
[01:38:28 - 01:38:28] fast funding that will help
[01:38:28 - 01:38:32] us uh project that better
[01:38:32 - 01:38:34] and uh miss davis will
[01:38:34 - 01:38:34] continue to compute the no
[01:38:34 - 01:38:37] new revenue rate as she
[01:38:37 - 01:38:37] receives updated revenue rate as
[01:38:38 - 01:38:39] she receives updated information information
[01:38:41 - 01:38:41] and and we'll get the
[01:38:41 - 01:38:43] final appraisal ruled in july
[01:38:46 - 01:38:46] and miss stasis's team will
[01:38:46 - 01:38:49] continue to move the baseline
[01:38:49 - 01:38:52] budget for vacancies and hires
[01:38:52 - 01:38:52] and all that is going
[01:38:52 - 01:38:55] on she'll continue to advance
[01:38:55 - 01:38:57] it forward and then dr
[01:38:57 - 01:38:59] sarata will be reviewing additional
[01:38:59 - 01:39:02] funding requests that have been
[01:39:02 - 01:39:03] submitted and then we'll prepare
[01:39:03 - 01:39:06] for the final budget presentation
[01:39:06 - 01:39:08] workshop to the board of
[01:39:08 - 01:39:08] trustees which will be in
[01:39:08 - 01:39:11] the last board meeting uh
[01:39:11 - 01:39:13] planning for adopting the budget

[01:39:27 - 01:39:28] be either in late july
[01:39:28 - 01:39:30] or early august probably august
[01:39:30 - 01:39:32] might uh there should be
[01:39:32 - 01:39:33] a board meeting that board
[01:39:33 - 01:39:33] meeting is very important because
[01:39:36 - 01:39:36] that's where the salary enhancement
[01:39:36 - 01:39:37] if one is going to
[01:39:37 - 01:39:37] be passed needs to be
[01:39:41 - 01:39:41] passed for hr to have
[01:39:41 - 01:39:44] enough time to uh update
[01:39:44 - 01:39:44] the banner system so that's
[01:39:44 - 01:39:46] why that is scheduled in

[01:39:50 - 01:39:50] very important uh date for
