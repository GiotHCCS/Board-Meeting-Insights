[00:03:55 - 00:03:58] for 18 years working at
[00:03:58 - 00:03:58] the csd was rewarding for
[00:03:58 - 00:04:00] her because she was able
[00:04:00 - 00:04:00] to meet many students who
[00:04:02 - 00:04:02] had more than one disability
[00:04:02 - 00:04:04] and they had major challenges

[00:04:07 - 00:04:09] a csd staff member miss
[00:04:09 - 00:04:09] garcia was able to apply
[00:04:09 - 00:04:12] herself by learning how to
[00:04:12 - 00:04:14] do every task required by

[00:04:25 - 00:04:25] college working at the csd
[00:04:25 - 00:04:27] made her become humbler and
[00:04:27 - 00:04:29] more grounded by seeing the
[00:04:29 - 00:04:32] students potential to succeed because
[00:04:32 - 00:04:32] of their can do attitude
[00:04:33 - 00:04:33] because of these students she
[00:04:33 - 00:04:36] was able to continue her
[00:04:36 - 00:04:39] education and set goals for
[00:04:39 - 00:04:39] her future in 1991 miss

[00:05:00 - 00:05:00] at the college and she
[00:05:03 - 00:05:03] was hired as a tenure

[00:05:04 - 00:05:07] sign language program she's always
[00:05:07 - 00:05:08] been an active participant in

[00:05:11 - 00:05:11] the students to learn american
[00:05:14 - 00:05:14] sign language asl she says
[00:05:14 - 00:05:16] that her element is in
[00:05:16 - 00:05:16] the classroom and that her
[00:05:19 - 00:05:19] that in that place she
[00:05:19 - 00:05:21] is in a different dimension
[00:05:21 - 00:05:23] providing instructional activities for students

[00:05:29 - 00:05:30] month there were many reasons
[00:05:30 - 00:05:30] for her to decide that
[00:05:30 - 00:05:32] it was time to retire
[00:05:32 - 00:05:33] but the most important was
[00:05:33 - 00:05:34] to take care of her
[00:05:36 - 00:05:36] health it was a difficult
[00:05:36 - 00:05:38] decision but she has other
[00:05:38 - 00:05:38] goals in mind one of
[00:05:38 - 00:05:41] her plans is to volunteer
[00:05:41 - 00:05:42] for hospice and be there

[00:05:44 - 00:05:44] families she also wants to

[00:16:36 - 00:16:39] the high school students that
[00:16:39 - 00:16:39] we serve uh as you
[00:16:39 - 00:16:42] well know we serve high

[00:16:45 - 00:16:49] and public charter schools uh
[00:16:49 - 00:16:49] we offer college courses for
[00:16:52 - 00:16:52] dual credit to them uh
[00:16:52 - 00:16:54] we also have homeschool students
[00:16:54 - 00:16:56] who take dual credit with
[00:16:56 - 00:16:56] us in fact i was
[00:16:56 - 00:16:59] just looking at data today
[00:16:59 - 00:16:59] and we have a 20
[00:16:59 - 00:17:01] increase from last year so
[00:17:01 - 00:17:03] we have more and more
[00:17:03 - 00:17:05] homeschool students coming to campus
[00:17:05 - 00:17:05] uh as you know we
[00:17:05 - 00:17:08] also have early college high
[00:17:08 - 00:17:10] schools and pathways in technologies
[00:17:10 - 00:17:12] early college high schools or
[00:17:12 - 00:17:12] peks uh in addition we
[00:17:15 - 00:17:15] have some early college programs
[00:17:15 - 00:17:17] offered to dual credit students
[00:17:17 - 00:17:20] for them to earn a
[00:17:20 - 00:17:22] post-secary credential at any point
[00:17:22 - 00:17:22] if you have any questions
[00:17:26 - 00:17:28] please let me know i'd
[00:17:28 - 00:17:28] like to give you kind
[00:17:28 - 00:17:31] of like a perspective right
[00:17:31 - 00:17:32] 20 years uh so back
[00:17:33 - 00:17:36] in 2004 a very small
[00:17:36 - 00:17:38] percentage 4 of our student
[00:17:38 - 00:17:38] population was high school student
[00:17:38 - 00:17:39] population was high school students
[00:17:39 - 00:17:44] students 10 years later right
[00:17:44 - 00:17:46] we already had we already
[00:17:46 - 00:17:46] had early college high schools
[00:17:48 - 00:17:48] but still dual credit was
[00:17:48 - 00:17:51] still a significant uh portion
[00:17:51 - 00:17:55] of our high school students
[00:17:55 - 00:17:55] today or last fall 36
[00:17:57 - 00:17:57] of our enrollment was high
[00:17:57 - 00:17:59] school students with early college
[00:17:59 - 00:18:03] high schools of course taking
[00:18:03 - 00:18:03] over the lead and now
[00:18:06 - 00:18:06] we can see also pek
[00:18:06 - 00:18:10] students uh this last i
[00:18:10 - 00:18:10] have to move because now
[00:18:10 - 00:18:13] i have flowers right in
[00:18:13 - 00:18:13] front of me uh so
[00:18:13 - 00:18:18] this spring 39 44 of
[00:18:18 - 00:18:18] our stu of our student
[00:18:18 - 00:18:23] population was high school students
[00:18:23 - 00:18:26] um uh again we're very
[00:18:26 - 00:18:26] quickly right approaching that 40
[00:18:28 - 00:18:30] mark um dr can attest
[00:18:30 - 00:18:34] that colleagues across the state
[00:18:34 - 00:18:34] other community colleges have 50
[00:18:36 - 00:18:36] uh high school enrollment in
[00:18:36 - 00:18:44] in uh some so again
[00:18:44 - 00:18:44] approaching the 40 mark but
[00:18:46 - 00:18:46] something that i wanted to
[00:18:46 - 00:18:48] uh point out is that
[00:18:48 - 00:18:49] our students are incredibly successful
[00:18:49 - 00:18:52] high school students are very
[00:18:52 - 00:18:52] successful uh they complete their
[00:18:56 - 00:18:56] course completion is 87 compared
[00:18:56 - 00:19:00] to 72 of non- high
[00:19:00 - 00:19:00] school students and uh mr
[00:19:03 - 00:19:03] flores tells me that 71
[00:19:06 - 00:19:08] are um academically educationally disadvantaged
[00:19:12 - 00:19:12] uh and that is uh
[00:19:12 - 00:19:12] as he has mentioned in
[00:19:14 - 00:19:14] the budget workshops right our
[00:19:14 - 00:19:18] funding now also um that
[00:19:18 - 00:19:18] impacts our our state now
[00:19:19 - 00:19:21] also um that impacts our
[00:19:22 - 00:19:26] our state funding so definitely
[00:19:26 - 00:19:29] dual credit uh great indicator
[00:19:29 - 00:19:29] of student success so some
[00:19:29 - 00:19:31] of the things that we
[00:19:31 - 00:19:33] notice right in looking at
[00:19:33 - 00:19:33] the data not only with
[00:19:33 - 00:19:35] us uh here at epcc
[00:19:35 - 00:19:35] but with our partners at
[00:19:38 - 00:19:38] utep is that students have
[00:19:38 - 00:19:40] higher gpa do students who
[00:19:40 - 00:19:43] take college courses in dual
[00:19:43 - 00:19:43] credit um their graduation rate
[00:19:43 - 00:19:46] at epcc the third three-year
[00:19:46 - 00:19:49] graduation rate is twice as
[00:19:49 - 00:19:51] high than non- high school
[00:19:51 - 00:19:51] students and our friends from
[00:19:53 - 00:19:53] utep tell us that the
[00:19:54 - 00:19:56] four-year graduation rate is three
[00:19:56 - 00:19:58] times higher if students had
[00:19:58 - 00:19:58] taken dual credit in high
[00:20:01 - 00:20:01] school so again great uh
[00:20:01 - 00:20:03] indicator of of of student
[00:20:03 - 00:20:06] sessions and of course great
[00:20:06 - 00:20:09] savings for the students and
[00:20:09 - 00:20:11] their families uh paso community
[00:20:11 - 00:20:11] college waves tuition and fees
[00:20:14 - 00:20:14] and our partners provide textbooks
[00:20:14 - 00:20:17] and and materials for them
[00:20:22 - 00:20:22] uh 62 of our early
[00:20:22 - 00:20:24] college and high uh high
[00:20:24 - 00:20:24] school and pek students have
[00:20:24 - 00:20:27] earned a post-secary uh credential
[00:20:27 - 00:20:29] uh we're approaching the 8
[00:20:29 - 00:20:33] 000 mark historically right to
[00:20:33 - 00:20:33] date and even our non
[00:20:33 - 00:20:35] early college and pek students
[00:20:35 - 00:20:38] have earned post-secary credentials 436
[00:20:38 - 00:20:40] so far and we're going
[00:20:40 - 00:20:40] to see an increase because
[00:20:42 - 00:20:42] uh my fellow deans have
[00:20:42 - 00:20:45] been working really hard at
[00:20:45 - 00:20:47] uh creating more level one
[00:20:47 - 00:20:47] certificates that our partners are
[00:20:50 - 00:20:50] very interested in not necessarily
[00:20:50 - 00:20:52] under early college and ptech
[00:20:52 - 00:20:54] but even for uh our
[00:20:54 - 00:20:54] traditional let's say dual credit
[00:20:54 - 00:20:57] our traditional let's say dual
[00:20:58 - 00:21:01] credit students all right a
[00:21:01 - 00:21:01] little bit about what we
[00:21:01 - 00:21:05] do to stay in touch
[00:21:05 - 00:21:07] with our partners um if
[00:21:07 - 00:21:10] you remember uh dr used
[00:21:10 - 00:21:10] to report on the different
[00:21:10 - 00:21:12] events that we had throughout
[00:21:12 - 00:21:14] the year uh but i
[00:21:14 - 00:21:14] figure maybe just once a
[00:21:14 - 00:21:16] year is enough for you
[00:21:16 - 00:21:16] to know all of the
[00:21:16 - 00:21:19] things that we do to
[00:21:19 - 00:21:21] to collaborate with our partners
[00:21:21 - 00:21:21] um so definitely we have
[00:21:21 - 00:21:23] a number of workshops during
[00:21:23 - 00:21:25] faculty development we have two
[00:21:25 - 00:21:29] specific for our uh high
[00:21:29 - 00:21:29] school partners um we have
[00:21:33 - 00:21:33] we host a half a

[00:21:38 - 00:21:40] newly credential dual credit faculty
[00:21:40 - 00:21:40] just to get them ready

[00:21:43 - 00:21:47] the high school and we
[00:21:47 - 00:21:47] also have the dual credit
[00:21:47 - 00:21:49] forum uh typically in the
[00:21:49 - 00:21:50] spring again an opportunity to

[00:22:18 - 00:22:22] as well and this is
[00:22:22 - 00:22:22] an opportunity to uh um

[00:23:16 - 00:23:18] of course epcc so we're
[00:23:18 - 00:23:20] busy we're always having something
[00:23:20 - 00:23:20] there's always something for something
[00:23:21 - 00:23:24] there's always something for everyone
[00:23:26 - 00:23:26] uh now let me uh
[00:23:26 - 00:23:30] focus on early college and
[00:23:30 - 00:23:30] pex and uh as you
[00:23:30 - 00:23:33] know these schools are designated
[00:23:33 - 00:23:33] by the tea and they
[00:23:33 - 00:23:35] have to meet certain requirements
[00:23:35 - 00:23:38] right they are evaluated based
[00:23:38 - 00:23:41] on uh their access achievement
[00:23:41 - 00:23:44] and attainment outcomebased measures uh
[00:23:44 - 00:23:44] when i created this slide
[00:23:46 - 00:23:46] we hadn't heard from ta
[00:23:46 - 00:23:48] but we just heard from
[00:23:48 - 00:23:51] ta about their designations uh
[00:23:51 - 00:23:51] so i can share some
[00:23:51 - 00:23:52] of it some of it
[00:23:54 - 00:23:54] is confidential but i can
[00:23:54 - 00:23:58] tell you that 10 of
[00:23:58 - 00:23:58] our schools were designated with
[00:24:00 - 00:24:00] distinction which is they went
[00:24:00 - 00:24:03] above and beyond uh the
[00:24:03 - 00:24:05] metrics that tea establishes for
[00:24:05 - 00:24:14] designation so very uh and
[00:24:14 - 00:24:14] now i tried to change
[00:24:14 - 00:24:15] graphics because uh i want
[00:24:15 - 00:24:18] to keep you interested so

[00:31:25 - 00:31:28] as the veterans capital of
[00:31:28 - 00:31:28] the usa and that's throughout
[00:31:31 - 00:31:31] the county and we claim
[00:31:31 - 00:31:34] to celebrate veterans every day
[00:31:37 - 00:31:37] in in this community we
[00:31:37 - 00:31:39] are proud of the rich
[00:31:39 - 00:31:39] military history of our local
[00:31:42 - 00:31:42] heroes so in our unyielding
[00:31:42 - 00:31:44] commitment to veterans who serve
[00:31:44 - 00:31:47] in all branches of the
[00:31:47 - 00:31:47] military in time of war
[00:31:47 - 00:31:51] and peace a group of
[00:31:51 - 00:31:51] us mostly they are veterans
[00:31:51 - 00:31:53] and a lot of them
[00:31:53 - 00:31:56] are veterans from the vietnam
[00:31:56 - 00:31:56] era uh we are on
[00:31:56 - 00:31:58] a mission to establish a
[00:31:58 - 00:31:58] local shrine to honor the
[00:32:00 - 00:32:00] veterans memories and the sacrifices
[00:32:03 - 00:32:03] that they made throughout along
[00:32:03 - 00:32:05] the along with their families
[00:32:05 - 00:32:08] throughout the wars that they
[00:32:08 - 00:32:12] have uh served under so
[00:32:12 - 00:32:12] it is our vision to
[00:32:12 - 00:32:16] find a building that uh
[00:32:16 - 00:32:16] we would be able to
[00:32:16 - 00:32:18] showcase and share information to
[00:32:18 - 00:32:20] preserve and promote the heritage
[00:32:20 - 00:32:23] of their their military accomplishments
[00:32:25 - 00:32:25] um we anticipate that their
[00:32:25 - 00:32:28] stories will have uh multiple
[00:32:28 - 00:32:31] angles of impact that will
[00:32:31 - 00:32:31] touch audiences young and old
[00:32:33 - 00:32:33] and at the same time
[00:32:33 - 00:32:35] contribute to the historical knowledge
[00:32:35 - 00:32:38] of el paso county and
[00:32:38 - 00:32:38] highlight the contributions of those
[00:32:39 - 00:32:43] who served so with that
[00:32:43 - 00:32:43] in this effort we are
[00:32:46 - 00:32:51] planning to secure resources and
[00:32:51 - 00:32:51] um to try and find
[00:32:51 - 00:32:54] a place we don't quite
[00:32:54 - 00:32:54] have that figured out where
[00:32:54 - 00:32:56] but we are looking at
[00:32:56 - 00:33:00] possibly um having a one
[00:33:00 - 00:33:03] of those modular buildings and
[00:33:03 - 00:33:06] we are thinking of possibly
[00:33:06 - 00:33:06] looking at epcc if it
[00:33:06 - 00:33:10] could be possible over there
[00:33:10 - 00:33:10] on in your area next
[00:33:12 - 00:33:12] to the monuments that we
[00:33:12 - 00:33:15] already have there for our
[00:33:15 - 00:33:15] military so this is a
[00:33:18 - 00:33:18] consideration and we are uh
[00:33:18 - 00:33:21] exploring that possibility so i
[00:33:21 - 00:33:23] just wanted to share with
[00:33:23 - 00:33:27] you that information so hopefully
[00:33:27 - 00:33:27] it's going to become a
[00:33:27 - 00:33:30] reality um and a reality

[00:34:31 - 00:34:31] out as you enter fort
[00:34:31 - 00:34:34] bliss but when we do
[00:34:34 - 00:34:37] this let let's recognize all
[00:34:37 - 00:34:37] the veterans okay and so
[00:34:37 - 00:34:39] but it's an outstanding monument
[00:34:39 - 00:34:42] across from the county courthouse
[00:34:42 - 00:34:42] and i i wish i
[00:34:42 - 00:34:45] knew one some of the
[00:34:45 - 00:34:45] others but but i'd ask
[00:34:47 - 00:34:47] that you include all a
[00:34:47 - 00:34:49] name of all the veterans
[00:34:49 - 00:34:52] please i have been surprised
[00:34:52 - 00:34:54] at the names that have
[00:34:54 - 00:34:54] come up from some of
[00:34:54 - 00:34:57] the committee members that are
[00:34:57 - 00:34:59] doing the research um and
[00:34:59 - 00:34:59] it's very interesting and we
[00:34:59 - 00:35:02] have you know medal of
[00:35:02 - 00:35:05] honor uh recipients and some
[00:35:05 - 00:35:05] of the people that some
[00:35:05 - 00:35:06] of us didn't even know
[00:35:06 - 00:35:10] that and the contribution specifically
[00:35:10 - 00:35:10] i think was honored then
[00:35:10 - 00:35:13] as you mentioned that sergeant
[00:35:13 - 00:35:15] ray benites ray benovitz yes
[00:35:17 - 00:35:17] well i don't know how
[00:35:17 - 00:35:19] many of you have visited
[00:35:19 - 00:35:19] the site but right now
[00:35:19 - 00:35:22] they're just finishing up the
[00:35:22 - 00:35:24] persian golf all the veterans
[00:35:24 - 00:35:24] that serve in persian golf
[00:35:28 - 00:35:28] memorial uh the site is
[00:35:28 - 00:35:31] mostly all done by donations
[00:35:31 - 00:35:33] from veteran associations all across
[00:35:33 - 00:35:33] the country and i don't
[00:35:33 - 00:35:35] think the college has ever
[00:35:35 - 00:35:39] turned down a request but
[00:35:39 - 00:35:39] uh i'm sure as long
[00:35:39 - 00:35:41] as they come with a
[00:35:44 - 00:35:46] plans that fit our i
[00:35:46 - 00:35:46] just don't think we need
[00:35:46 - 00:35:48] to put any funds from
[00:35:48 - 00:35:48] the college most of the
[00:35:51 - 00:35:51] veterans uh put bring up
[00:35:51 - 00:35:54] most of the money through
[00:35:54 - 00:35:54] raffles and i know there's
[00:35:55 - 00:35:55] a few bricks out there
[00:35:55 - 00:35:58] with hagert's names on them
[00:35:58 - 00:36:01] that we've paid several hundred
[00:36:01 - 00:36:01] for so i know there's
[00:36:03 - 00:36:03] all kinds of things that
[00:36:03 - 00:36:04] they do for raising funds
[00:36:06 - 00:36:06] as a as a veteran
[00:36:06 - 00:36:11] i think that's the best
[00:36:11 - 00:36:11] idea i i personally would
[00:36:11 - 00:36:13] not want an organizational support
[00:36:13 - 00:36:17] i wouldn't want to see
[00:36:17 - 00:36:19] this individual dedication to the
[00:36:19 - 00:36:21] recognition yeah so i don't
[00:36:21 - 00:36:23] think there's a problem with
[00:36:23 - 00:36:23] we have there's a lot
[00:36:23 - 00:36:25] of room still out there
[00:36:25 - 00:36:27] at the site i don't
[00:36:27 - 00:36:27] know how many people have
[00:36:27 - 00:36:28] visited it i recommend that
[00:36:28 - 00:36:31] you do it's beautiful that
[00:36:31 - 00:36:31] big old flag right up
[00:36:33 - 00:36:33] against the mountain right now
[00:36:35 - 00:36:35] especially when the mountain is
[00:36:35 - 00:36:38] so green after all this
[00:36:38 - 00:36:38] rain but uh i don't
[00:36:40 - 00:36:40] think we have a problem
[00:36:40 - 00:36:42] dr very much and one
[00:36:42 - 00:36:42] of the things that we're
[00:36:46 - 00:36:46] exploring is um there's a
[00:36:46 - 00:36:49] a group that um you
[00:36:49 - 00:36:49] apply for and they donate
[00:36:49 - 00:36:52] the building but we would
[00:36:52 - 00:36:55] have to do the foundation
[00:36:55 - 00:36:55] and then they would donate
[00:36:57 - 00:36:57] the building so we're exploring
[00:36:57 - 00:36:59] that possibility or if anybody
[00:36:59 - 00:37:01] in the audience has a
[00:37:01 - 00:37:03] building that you'd like to
[00:37:03 - 00:37:03] donate for this effort and
[00:37:03 - 00:37:07] we'd be more than happy
[00:37:07 - 00:37:09] to to take it um
[00:37:09 - 00:37:09] i just think that it's
[00:37:09 - 00:37:12] you know the idea of
[00:37:12 - 00:37:12] having the having it right
[00:37:14 - 00:37:14] next to that the other
[00:37:14 - 00:37:17] monuments would be u you
[00:37:17 - 00:37:20] know would be great dr
[00:37:20 - 00:37:20] grammar is this just the
[00:37:20 - 00:37:22] purpose of a memorial a
[00:37:22 - 00:37:24] museum intended for a meeting
[00:37:24 - 00:37:26] space no it's not really
[00:37:26 - 00:37:29] for a meeting uh space
[00:37:29 - 00:37:29] it's more like to showcase
[00:37:29 - 00:37:34] the different um heroes that
[00:37:34 - 00:37:37] were from this community that
[00:37:37 - 00:37:40] serve from this community and
[00:37:40 - 00:37:40] have a lot of pictures
[00:37:40 - 00:37:43] of a lot of the
[00:37:43 - 00:37:43] servicemen and women and then
[00:37:43 - 00:37:46] a qr code so that
[00:37:46 - 00:37:46] we the vision is that
[00:37:46 - 00:37:48] we would even create it
[00:37:48 - 00:37:51] to where um they could
[00:37:51 - 00:37:51] take students during field trips
[00:37:54 - 00:37:54] and teach them about the
[00:37:54 - 00:37:57] different wars like have several
[00:37:57 - 00:38:00] rooms and each room represents
[00:38:00 - 00:38:00] uh one of the one
[00:38:00 - 00:38:03] of the different wars that
[00:38:03 - 00:38:05] they fought and um and
[00:38:05 - 00:38:05] also some of the stories
[00:38:05 - 00:38:07] and artifacts we also learned
[00:38:07 - 00:38:10] last night at a meeting
[00:38:10 - 00:38:13] that um apparently they're going
[00:38:13 - 00:38:13] to be closing down the
[00:38:13 - 00:38:17] the museum um in fort
[00:38:17 - 00:38:17] bliss so you know but
[00:38:20 - 00:38:20] these veterans are really interesting
[00:38:23 - 00:38:23] they don't really want the
[00:38:23 - 00:38:26] the the museum or the
[00:38:26 - 00:38:28] inside for bliss they want
[00:38:28 - 00:38:28] it outside they think it's
[00:38:28 - 00:38:31] too encumbersome to try and
[00:38:31 - 00:38:32] go in there so there's
[00:38:32 - 00:38:32] a lot of very interesting
[00:38:34 - 00:38:34] discussions going on on this
[00:38:34 - 00:38:37] but it's picking it's um
[00:38:37 - 00:38:40] you know the momentum is
[00:38:40 - 00:38:40] is really there now so
[00:38:40 - 00:38:43] we're going to continue to
[00:38:43 - 00:38:43] pursue it and if you
[00:38:44 - 00:38:44] know anybody that's willing to
[00:38:44 - 00:38:46] donate a few million dollars
[00:38:46 - 00:38:46] we'll take them few million
[00:38:46 - 00:38:47] dollars we'll take them too
[00:38:47 - 00:38:50] too yeah and if everybody
[00:38:50 - 00:38:53] remember back in the early
[00:38:53 - 00:38:53] 70s uh the el paso
[00:38:54 - 00:38:57] community college practically was all
[00:38:57 - 00:38:59] for the gis coming back
[00:38:59 - 00:38:59] from vietnam the gi bill
[00:39:01 - 00:39:01] paid all their tuition so
[00:39:01 - 00:39:04] we have a strong relationship
[00:39:04 - 00:39:06] with the military and if
[00:39:06 - 00:39:06] you remember i i don't
[00:39:06 - 00:39:07] know mr smith you might
[00:39:07 - 00:39:09] have been no you didn't
[00:39:09 - 00:39:10] come till 1980 mr flores
[00:39:11 - 00:39:15] who's the oldest one not
[00:39:15 - 00:39:17] oldest oh remember that we
[00:39:17 - 00:39:17] uh we had our first
[00:39:19 - 00:39:19] classes out at fort bliss
[00:39:19 - 00:39:21] at the old training site
[00:39:21 - 00:39:21] they they leased it to
[00:39:21 - 00:39:26] us for a dollar a
[00:39:26 - 00:39:28] year so epcc started uh
[00:39:28 - 00:39:28] basically because we had a
[00:39:28 - 00:39:29] lot of veterans coming back
[00:39:29 - 00:39:33] from vietnam logan heights some
[00:39:33 - 00:39:33] of us went to logan
[00:39:33 - 00:39:35] heights well i didn't want
[00:39:35 - 00:39:35] to date ourselves well i
[00:39:35 - 00:39:36] didn't want to date ourselves
[00:39:36 - 00:39:38] dr dr well because you
[00:39:38 - 00:39:38] were busy fighting well because
[00:39:38 - 00:39:39] you were busy fighting fires
[00:39:39 - 00:39:42] fires yeah how is this
[00:39:42 - 00:39:42] but uh we have a
[00:39:44 - 00:39:44] strong relationship with the veterans
[00:39:47 - 00:39:47] and i i think it's
[00:39:47 - 00:39:48] a great idea so thanks
[00:39:48 - 00:39:50] for bringing that so i
[00:39:50 - 00:39:50] will give you a more
[00:39:50 - 00:39:53] formal report once we get
[00:39:53 - 00:39:53] um because we had to
[00:39:53 - 00:39:55] create a board and we're
[00:39:55 - 00:39:58] looking to you know create
[00:39:58 - 00:40:00] a 501c3 formalize the name
[00:40:00 - 00:40:01] of it because we couldn't
[00:40:01 - 00:40:01] agree on the name last
[00:40:02 - 00:40:04] night we had several names
[00:40:04 - 00:40:06] but i think each one
[00:40:06 - 00:40:06] of us said a different
[00:40:06 - 00:40:09] name so we never agreed
[00:40:09 - 00:40:09] on one but we will
[00:40:09 - 00:40:11] takes a little while to
[00:40:11 - 00:40:11] get them all on the
[00:40:13 - 00:40:15] same page so dr graham
[00:40:15 - 00:40:15] the item on the agenda
[00:40:17 - 00:40:17] says discussion action regarding a
[00:40:19 - 00:40:19] potential initiative um would the
[00:40:22 - 00:40:22] action be just that we
[00:40:22 - 00:40:24] would process the discussion i
[00:40:24 - 00:40:24] mean i mean continue the
[00:40:28 - 00:40:28] the discussion further continue the
[00:40:32 - 00:40:32] discussion further just because um
[00:40:32 - 00:40:34] at this time it was
[00:40:34 - 00:40:38] just presenting the idea of
[00:40:38 - 00:40:38] the possibility of having it
[00:40:38 - 00:40:41] um in some of the
[00:40:41 - 00:40:44] uh epcc facility which would
[00:40:44 - 00:40:44] be out in the the
[00:40:44 - 00:40:48] existing monument area in flex
[00:40:48 - 00:40:51] across america uh so if
[00:40:51 - 00:40:51] the board is in agreement
[00:40:51 - 00:40:54] we will um and again
[00:40:54 - 00:40:57] seriously if somebody was to
[00:40:57 - 00:40:57] offer a building or something
[00:40:57 - 00:40:59] cuz um the commissioner had
[00:40:59 - 00:41:01] mentioned to me a long
[00:41:01 - 00:41:01] time ago that yes that
[00:41:01 - 00:41:03] the county had buildings but
[00:41:03 - 00:41:03] then when i pinned him
[00:41:06 - 00:41:06] down i i didn't quite
[00:41:06 - 00:41:06] get one so but if
[00:41:08 - 00:41:08] if we can come up
[00:41:08 - 00:41:10] with a building that would
[00:41:10 - 00:41:10] be ideal if not at
[00:41:10 - 00:41:18] least we would any other
[00:41:18 - 00:41:20] discussion so at the moment
[00:41:20 - 00:41:20] we would have no action
[00:41:23 - 00:41:23] then until we bring it
[00:41:23 - 00:41:23] up later is that then
[00:41:23 - 00:41:23] until we bring it up
[00:41:23 - 00:41:23] later is that okay okay
[00:41:25 - 00:41:25] i think the action would
[00:41:25 - 00:41:30] just be that the uh
[00:41:30 - 00:41:30] board would endorse the idea
[00:41:30 - 00:41:34] of uh us working towards
[00:41:34 - 00:41:37] that together with no cost
[00:41:37 - 00:41:37] to the college of course
[00:41:39 - 00:41:39] if we're going to endorse
[00:41:39 - 00:41:41] i would propose the next
[00:41:41 - 00:41:41] time we discuss that we
[00:41:44 - 00:41:44] would have an overriding principle
[00:41:44 - 00:41:45] would have an overriding principle
[00:41:46 - 00:41:49] um um personally uh if
[00:41:49 - 00:41:52] you go to various monuments
[00:41:52 - 00:41:52] i think to say well
[00:41:52 - 00:41:53] we're going to have this
[00:41:53 - 00:41:56] we're going to do that
[00:41:56 - 00:41:56] you know you split the
[00:41:56 - 00:41:59] focus and if this is
[00:41:59 - 00:42:02] the veterans and comes to
[00:42:02 - 00:42:02] mind the vietnam war monument
[00:42:05 - 00:42:05] in washington dc and the
[00:42:05 - 00:42:06] visiting in washington dc and
[00:42:06 - 00:42:08] the visiting monuments monuments and
[00:42:08 - 00:42:08] and there it's it's an
[00:42:08 - 00:42:12] individual personal thing uh and
[00:42:12 - 00:42:14] i you know the having
[00:42:14 - 00:42:14] a meeting hall is an
[00:42:14 - 00:42:17] interesting idea but i think
[00:42:17 - 00:42:17] i think that you start
[00:42:19 - 00:42:19] dividing your focus if you
[00:42:19 - 00:42:21] don't i think the focus
[00:42:21 - 00:42:21] of the memorial is to
[00:42:24 - 00:42:24] recognize the individual and and
[00:42:27 - 00:42:27] collected family sacrifices and we
[00:42:29 - 00:42:29] really don't need need to
[00:42:29 - 00:42:31] have a place where we
[00:42:31 - 00:42:31] can have a meeting for
[00:42:32 - 00:42:32] something else because they have
[00:42:32 - 00:42:34] an available room i think
[00:42:34 - 00:42:40] it's the solenity of of
[00:42:40 - 00:42:43] the vietnam wall should be
[00:42:43 - 00:42:43] the primary focus recognition of
[00:42:43 - 00:42:44] be the primary focus recognition
[00:42:44 - 00:42:46] of sacrifice sacrifice and that
[00:42:46 - 00:42:46] wall is already there many
[00:42:46 - 00:42:51] of us visited frequently yeah
[00:42:51 - 00:42:51] the wall that they have
[00:42:51 - 00:42:53] there at uh in the
[00:42:53 - 00:42:53] northeast is the wall just
[00:42:55 - 00:42:55] like in in washington dc
[00:42:55 - 00:42:58] but it has all the
[00:42:58 - 00:42:58] names of the of the
[00:42:58 - 00:43:01] men and women that uh
[00:43:01 - 00:43:01] died from the el paso
[00:43:01 - 00:43:04] county area and there all
[00:43:04 - 00:43:07] their names are on that
[00:43:07 - 00:43:07] that wall when you go
[00:43:07 - 00:43:09] visit it really is a
[00:43:09 - 00:43:09] neat site if you haven't
[00:43:11 - 00:43:11] been there you need to
[00:43:11 - 00:43:13] go and i think it's
[00:43:13 - 00:43:17] on thursday when they have
[00:43:17 - 00:43:17] the food trucks and it's
[00:43:17 - 00:43:19] uh you know and it's
[00:43:19 - 00:43:19] it's a good time to
[00:43:19 - 00:43:21] go and eat your dinner
[00:43:21 - 00:43:24] there and visit the monuments
[00:43:24 - 00:43:24] because they the the women

[00:43:38 - 00:43:41] that it doesn't really have
[00:43:41 - 00:43:41] like uh and i wish
[00:43:41 - 00:43:45] we had some kind of
[00:43:45 - 00:43:47] recognition that that is facility
[00:43:47 - 00:43:47] of the el paso community
[00:43:50 - 00:43:50] college it doesn't say that
[00:43:50 - 00:43:53] anywhere and we should have
[00:43:53 - 00:43:53] some kind of big sign
[00:43:56 - 00:43:56] that says you know um
[00:43:56 - 00:43:59] that thanks to the el
[00:43:59 - 00:43:59] paso community college all of

[00:44:28 - 00:44:31] the college's um donation of

[00:55:48 - 00:55:51] mr can we implement a
[00:55:51 - 00:55:53] policy of saying those letters
[00:55:53 - 00:55:55] as identified in the minutes
[00:55:55 - 00:55:55] rather than having her to
[00:55:55 - 00:55:57] go through all that number
[00:55:57 - 00:55:59] one i i actually make
[00:55:59 - 00:56:01] that question i just deferred
[00:56:01 - 00:56:01] to mr rogan he said
[00:56:01 - 00:56:01] no i just deferred to
[00:56:01 - 00:56:01] mr rogan he said no
[00:56:01 - 00:56:05] problem problem okay and and
[00:56:05 - 00:56:05] second of all i don't
[00:56:07 - 00:56:07] know how many times we
[00:56:07 - 00:56:09] we've been through this but
[00:56:09 - 00:56:11] what we're doing is looking
[00:56:11 - 00:56:11] at an individual i wonder
[00:56:11 - 00:56:14] if dr pinley can give
[00:56:14 - 00:56:14] us the 30 000 foot
[00:56:16 - 00:56:16] view of where we are
[00:56:16 - 00:56:18] i mean if you look
[00:56:18 - 00:56:18] at the policy manual it's
[00:56:18 - 00:56:20] this big and each one
[00:56:20 - 00:56:20] of those is a letter
[00:56:23 - 00:56:23] so you know where are
[00:56:23 - 00:56:25] we you know like a
[00:56:25 - 00:56:25] 30 000 foot view of
[00:56:25 - 00:56:29] where we are in policies
[00:56:29 - 00:56:29] and by the way just
[00:56:29 - 00:56:32] a real rough estimate of
[00:56:32 - 00:56:32] how much asset that is
[00:56:35 - 00:56:35] your time is spent on
[00:56:35 - 00:56:40] this dr penley please thank
[00:56:40 - 00:56:43] you mr exer um in
[00:56:43 - 00:56:43] terms of the uh the
[00:56:43 - 00:56:47] short answer is where are
[00:56:47 - 00:56:47] we with policies um pending
[00:56:50 - 00:56:50] the approval of this action
[00:56:50 - 00:56:54] item we are uh caught
[00:56:54 - 00:56:54] up with tasby updates for
[00:56:54 - 00:56:57] the time being uh one
[00:56:57 - 00:57:00] of the advantages of the
[00:57:00 - 00:57:00] board's decision to convert our
[00:57:03 - 00:57:03] policies to to the tasby
[00:57:03 - 00:57:05] system is we can be
[00:57:05 - 00:57:08] confident that we're now compliant
[00:57:08 - 00:57:08] with uh state and federal
[00:57:08 - 00:57:11] law and other statutes um
[00:57:11 - 00:57:13] which i'm i personally could
[00:57:13 - 00:57:13] not have said in in
[00:57:13 - 00:57:16] the past um and and
[00:57:16 - 00:57:18] you all remember that this
[00:57:18 - 00:57:18] was a bit of a
[00:57:18 - 00:57:20] heavy load it took about
[00:57:20 - 00:57:20] 18 months for you all
[00:57:20 - 00:57:23] to go through that conversion
[00:57:23 - 00:57:25] process looking at your policies
[00:57:25 - 00:57:28] who went through it uh
[00:57:28 - 00:57:28] well you you all approved
[00:57:28 - 00:57:31] the the local policies i
[00:57:31 - 00:57:31] i just want to emphasize
[00:57:31 - 00:57:32] that you were the one
[00:57:32 - 00:57:35] that did it well it
[00:57:35 - 00:57:35] it was it was a
[00:57:35 - 00:57:39] cabinet uh we we went
[00:57:39 - 00:57:39] through each policy and and
[00:57:39 - 00:57:41] made the recommendation where it
[00:57:41 - 00:57:44] would fit should it be
[00:57:44 - 00:57:44] deleted should it be uh
[00:57:47 - 00:57:47] kept uh in its current
[00:57:47 - 00:57:51] form it it was uh
[00:57:51 - 00:57:51] it was a labor intensive
[00:57:51 - 00:57:52] 18 months or so but
[00:57:52 - 00:57:52] but we did it so
[00:57:52 - 00:57:54] at this point we're in
[00:57:54 - 00:57:59] maintenance mode um and most
[00:57:59 - 00:57:59] of our policies uh are
[00:57:59 - 00:58:01] not undergoing regular maintenance uh
[00:58:01 - 00:58:05] until we have a legislative
[00:58:05 - 00:58:07] session so i anticipate having
[00:58:07 - 00:58:07] a bit of a of
[00:58:07 - 00:58:10] a pause in policy updates
[00:58:10 - 00:58:13] until uh november december when
[00:58:13 - 00:58:15] tasby will be providing updates
[00:58:15 - 00:58:15] to many of these that
[00:58:15 - 00:58:18] came out of the legislative
[00:58:18 - 00:58:24] session um to your point
[00:58:24 - 00:58:24] in terms of of the
[00:58:24 - 00:58:25] size or or the effort
[00:58:25 - 00:58:25] you're absolutely right we have
[00:58:28 - 00:58:28] a whole shelf uh in
[00:58:28 - 00:58:30] our bookcases in my area
[00:58:30 - 00:58:30] devoted to the hard copies
[00:58:30 - 00:58:32] which were required to maintain
[00:58:32 - 00:58:34] dr sarata has a copy
[00:58:34 - 00:58:34] of all of the policies
[00:58:34 - 00:58:40] in his office um and
[00:58:40 - 00:58:40] in terms of your final
[00:58:40 - 00:58:42] question about resources um if
[00:58:42 - 00:58:44] i i was essentially what
[00:58:44 - 00:58:46] we're doing is that we
[00:58:46 - 00:58:46] paid you a bunch of
[00:58:46 - 00:58:48] money to sit there and
[00:58:48 - 00:58:48] read this stuff and and
[00:58:48 - 00:58:50] then coordinate with the rest
[00:58:50 - 00:58:53] of however you do it
[00:58:53 - 00:58:53] but it's 18 months a
[00:58:53 - 00:58:55] significant amount of time i
[00:58:55 - 00:58:56] guess is what you want
[00:58:56 - 00:58:58] to say for for the
[00:58:58 - 00:59:01] initial uh conversion and at
[00:59:01 - 00:59:01] this point um if i
[00:59:01 - 00:59:01] had to put a a
[00:59:04 - 00:59:04] stopwatch on it i would
[00:59:04 - 00:59:07] say each policy probably takes
[00:59:07 - 00:59:07] an hour and a half
[00:59:07 - 00:59:11] to two hours um from
[00:59:11 - 00:59:13] start to finish then then
[00:59:13 - 00:59:13] a real rough estimate of
[00:59:13 - 00:59:15] how many policies do we
[00:59:15 - 00:59:19] have if uh we have
[00:59:23 - 00:59:23] i would guess we have
[00:59:23 - 00:59:29] close to 200 right i
[00:59:29 - 00:59:29] ju i i just think
[00:59:29 - 00:59:29] we just we look at
[00:59:31 - 00:59:31] it individually and i think
[00:59:31 - 00:59:34] we need i just want
[00:59:34 - 00:59:34] to step back and say
[00:59:34 - 00:59:37] hey there's a bunch of
[00:59:37 - 00:59:42] stuff and it's changing all
[00:59:42 - 00:59:46] the time so where are
[00:59:46 - 00:59:46] we and i'm good thank
[00:59:46 - 00:59:48] you dr penny you've done
[00:59:48 - 00:59:51] a wonderful job with a
[00:59:51 - 00:59:51] transition along with a team
[00:59:54 - 00:59:54] because it it took a
[00:59:54 - 00:59:58] lot to move away from
[00:59:58 - 00:59:58] the oldfashioned style of policy
[01:00:01 - 01:00:05] creation and archiving to what
[01:00:05 - 01:00:05] we have now it's it's
[01:00:05 - 01:00:12] good and dr graham is
[01:00:12 - 01:00:13] very happy and dr graham
[01:00:13 - 01:00:15] is very happy yes yes
[01:00:17 - 01:00:17] and then every legislative session
[01:00:17 - 01:00:20] will give us some new
[01:00:20 - 01:00:22] ones so we'll we'll keep
[01:00:22 - 01:00:24] you busy do we have
[01:00:24 - 01:00:24] a a presidential policy that
[01:00:26 - 01:00:26] we have to get rid
[01:00:26 - 01:00:32] of two policies for do
[01:00:32 - 01:00:32] have one policy that that
[01:00:32 - 01:00:35] we will be presenting uh
[01:00:35 - 01:00:35] my hope is that we
[01:00:35 - 01:00:36] will be presenting to you
[01:00:36 - 01:00:36] and then that will be
[01:00:40 - 01:00:40] the final policy in the
[01:00:40 - 01:00:42] conversion but the policies are
[01:00:42 - 01:00:42] yours to do with your
[01:00:44 - 01:00:44] local policies are yours to
[01:00:44 - 01:00:54] do with as we had

[01:02:25 - 01:02:27] enterprise resource planning erp system
[01:02:27 - 01:02:27] in an amount not to
[01:02:33 - 01:02:35] any discussion any discussion yes
[01:02:35 - 01:02:38] yes uh i i'd know
[01:02:38 - 01:02:38] that i see oracle and
[01:02:38 - 01:02:40] i see banner and i
[01:02:40 - 01:02:40] i know that they are
[01:02:43 - 01:02:43] related but i mean we
[01:02:43 - 01:02:46] got a million two between
[01:02:46 - 01:02:46] two contracts and how do
[01:02:46 - 01:02:48] these guys need each other
[01:02:48 - 01:02:48] i mean can you can
[01:02:51 - 01:02:51] you tell us how do
[01:02:51 - 01:02:51] they mesh and why do
[01:02:53 - 01:02:53] we need both of them
[01:02:54 - 01:02:54] yes sir thank you for
[01:02:54 - 01:02:58] that question that's a great
[01:02:58 - 01:02:58] question um so the short
[01:03:00 - 01:03:00] answer is that banner depends
[01:03:00 - 01:03:03] on the oracle database platform
[01:03:03 - 01:03:05] and while banner is the
[01:03:05 - 01:03:11] college's erp system that handles
[01:03:11 - 01:03:11] student records uh hr finance
[01:03:11 - 01:03:14] um the data lives in
[01:03:14 - 01:03:19] the oracle uh database and
[01:03:19 - 01:03:19] it it depends on oracle
[01:03:19 - 01:03:21] and um they they work
[01:03:21 - 01:03:23] together obviously they need each
[01:03:23 - 01:03:25] other they work together technically
[01:03:25 - 01:03:26] but they're two separate companies
[01:03:26 - 01:03:28] companies and they require separate
[01:03:28 - 01:03:30] licensing and support okay is
[01:03:30 - 01:03:34] there any other organization that
[01:03:34 - 01:03:34] actually covers both areas both
[01:03:37 - 01:03:37] functions or are we really
[01:03:37 - 01:03:40] working uh is the industry
[01:03:40 - 01:03:42] such that they're they're segmented
[01:03:42 - 01:03:44] like that unfortunately we have
[01:03:44 - 01:03:46] to buy them separately so
[01:03:46 - 01:03:46] we have to uh purchase
[01:03:49 - 01:03:49] the licensing from banner uh
[01:03:49 - 01:03:50] for the erp system and
[01:03:50 - 01:03:50] then from oracle for the
[01:03:54 - 01:03:54] licenses of the database and
[01:03:54 - 01:03:55] also i would like to
[01:03:55 - 01:03:58] take the opportunity to highlight
[01:03:58 - 01:03:58] also that in this agreement
[01:04:02 - 01:04:02] uh we're um taking advantage
[01:04:02 - 01:04:03] of removing uh we're um
[01:04:03 - 01:04:04] taking advantage of removing a
[01:04:04 - 01:04:07] a module that is no
[01:04:07 - 01:04:10] longer needed excuse me uh
[01:04:10 - 01:04:10] it's a web web logic
[01:04:10 - 01:04:12] module that is no longer
[01:04:12 - 01:04:14] needed and also reducing the
[01:04:14 - 01:04:14] number of licenses that we
[01:04:14 - 01:04:16] have been using so we're
[01:04:16 - 01:04:20] making changes to the agreement
[01:04:20 - 01:04:20] and this in the period
[01:04:20 - 01:04:22] of three years we will
[01:04:22 - 01:04:32] potentially see a any other
[01:04:32 - 01:04:34] questions call the question mr

[01:04:51 - 01:04:51] with dell marketing lp for
[01:04:51 - 01:04:53] the purchase of desktop computers
[01:04:53 - 01:04:56] computer monitors and laptops for
[01:04:56 - 01:04:59] district-wide use in an amount
[01:04:59 - 01:04:59] not to exceed 750 000
[01:04:59 - 01:04:59] amount not to exceed 750

[01:05:04 - 01:05:04] approve 4 2 and 4
[01:05:04 - 01:05:07] 9 have some questions have
[01:05:07 - 01:05:11] some questions second second item
[01:05:11 - 01:05:11] 4 9 discussion and action
[01:05:11 - 01:05:14] on the approval to purchase
[01:05:14 - 01:05:18] from dell marketing lp a
[01:05:18 - 01:05:18] storage area network sum in
[01:05:18 - 01:05:28] an any questions mrs yes
[01:05:28 - 01:05:28] i have some questions on
[01:05:28 - 01:05:30] 4 2 in the agenda
[01:05:30 - 01:05:30] we um are saying we
[01:05:30 - 01:05:32] are estimating a significant number
[01:05:32 - 01:05:33] of desktop computers what is
[01:05:33 - 01:05:38] that significant number thank you
[01:05:38 - 01:05:39] for your question that's that's
[01:05:39 - 01:05:39] a really good question and
[01:05:39 - 01:05:41] the the amount that we
[01:05:41 - 01:05:41] base it on is on
[01:05:43 - 01:05:43] previous purchases that have been
[01:05:43 - 01:05:45] done throughout the throughout the
[01:05:45 - 01:05:50] fiscal year and this uh
[01:05:50 - 01:05:50] abstract uh that is in
[01:05:51 - 01:05:51] front of you for your
[01:05:51 - 01:05:54] approval is so that departments
[01:05:54 - 01:05:55] can buy uh computers when
[01:05:55 - 01:05:57] they're whenever they're needed this
[01:05:57 - 01:05:58] is not that for us
[01:05:58 - 01:05:58] that we're buying all the
[01:06:00 - 01:06:00] computers right now just a
[01:06:00 - 01:06:03] vehicle for them to use
[01:06:03 - 01:06:03] this approval to be able
[01:06:03 - 01:06:06] to purchase computers in the
[01:06:06 - 01:06:10] past years we um we
[01:06:10 - 01:06:10] average uh in terms of
[01:06:12 - 01:06:12] computers purchases it varies because
[01:06:14 - 01:06:14] sometimes we've done projects like
[01:06:14 - 01:06:18] last year we uh replaced
[01:06:18 - 01:06:20] over 2 000 desktop computers
[01:06:20 - 01:06:20] uh for the uh it
[01:06:20 - 01:06:23] computer labs and other labs
[01:06:23 - 01:06:25] across the district but for
[01:06:25 - 01:06:25] these that are just purchased
[01:06:25 - 01:06:28] by the departments it just
[01:06:28 - 01:06:31] varies every every year and
[01:06:31 - 01:06:31] it also includes uh it
[01:06:31 - 01:06:33] allows us to also buy
[01:06:33 - 01:06:35] the mobile the the laptops
[01:06:35 - 01:06:37] as well okay just the
[01:06:37 - 01:06:37] as as needed makes me
[01:06:37 - 01:06:39] a little bit nervous so
[01:06:39 - 01:06:40] do we have like a
[01:06:42 - 01:06:42] re uh refresh plan or
[01:06:42 - 01:06:45] a phase out plan or
[01:06:45 - 01:06:45] do you establish caps on
[01:06:45 - 01:06:47] each department of how much
[01:06:47 - 01:06:50] they are going to spend
[01:06:50 - 01:06:50] that's a great and excellent
[01:06:52 - 01:06:52] question and i'm glad um
[01:06:52 - 01:06:56] that you asked that as
[01:06:56 - 01:06:56] well because we do have
[01:06:56 - 01:06:57] a a mechanism to address
[01:06:57 - 01:07:00] some of the concerns that
[01:07:00 - 01:07:00] you have uh one of
[01:07:00 - 01:07:04] one of which is um
[01:07:04 - 01:07:06] that we uh refurbished computers
[01:07:06 - 01:07:06] those that have been uh
[01:07:09 - 01:07:09] replaced by a new computer
[01:07:09 - 01:07:11] we we take those other
[01:07:11 - 01:07:11] ones and we refurbish them
[01:07:13 - 01:07:13] and whenever anyone creates a
[01:07:14 - 01:07:15] work request to work on
[01:07:15 - 01:07:17] their computers one of the
[01:07:17 - 01:07:17] things that we do is
[01:07:17 - 01:07:20] we assess the computer for
[01:07:20 - 01:07:22] their their performance uh and
[01:07:22 - 01:07:22] the condition that it's in
[01:07:22 - 01:07:25] and if it's um if
[01:07:25 - 01:07:25] if it if it's recommended
[01:07:27 - 01:07:27] to be replaced we also
[01:07:27 - 01:07:29] offer that refurbished computer so
[01:07:29 - 01:07:33] that we they can have
[01:07:33 - 01:07:33] some savings and not uh
[01:07:33 - 01:07:36] do unneeded spending right because
[01:07:36 - 01:07:38] all of these um actually
[01:07:38 - 01:07:38] are the responsibility of every
[01:07:41 - 01:07:41] department budget head uh to
[01:07:41 - 01:07:44] assess and evaluate the need
[01:07:44 - 01:07:47] but they're also um welcome
[01:07:47 - 01:07:47] to create a a request
[01:07:47 - 01:07:49] for us to go and
[01:07:49 - 01:07:49] assess their computers to see
[01:07:49 - 01:07:51] if there's a need for
[01:07:51 - 01:07:51] it on top of that
[01:07:53 - 01:07:55] we also have another mechanism
[01:07:55 - 01:07:58] which is an approval process
[01:07:58 - 01:07:58] that we in coordination with
[01:07:58 - 01:08:01] the purchasing department all technical
[01:08:02 - 01:08:05] um or technology uh purchases
[01:08:05 - 01:08:08] uh required it approval so
[01:08:08 - 01:08:12] we review those requests and
[01:08:12 - 01:08:12] um we only approve as
[01:08:12 - 01:08:15] as needed not as once
[01:08:15 - 01:08:15] and on top of that
[01:08:15 - 01:08:18] we also i implemented a
[01:08:18 - 01:08:19] standardization of desktops and laptops
[01:08:19 - 01:08:20] so that it can help
[01:08:24 - 01:08:24] us with uh bulk pricing
[01:08:24 - 01:08:28] uh uh savings as well
[01:08:28 - 01:08:28] as u streamlining support and
[01:08:28 - 01:08:31] and responding quicker and that
[01:08:31 - 01:08:31] was my last question so
[01:08:31 - 01:08:31] thank and that was my
[01:08:32 - 01:08:32] last question so thank you
[01:08:32 - 01:08:35] you so do i do
[01:08:35 - 01:08:35] i understand that as a
[01:08:36 - 01:08:36] computer tech if i'm sitting
[01:08:36 - 01:08:38] there at the desk and
[01:08:38 - 01:08:38] all of a sudden i
[01:08:38 - 01:08:41] see in the local it
[01:08:41 - 01:08:42] magazine that the louis latest
[01:08:42 - 01:08:42] whippy dippy is out there
[01:08:42 - 01:08:44] and mine happens to be
[01:08:44 - 01:08:44] about a year old i
[01:08:46 - 01:08:46] mean it's functional it's good
[01:08:46 - 01:08:49] but i really like the
[01:08:49 - 01:08:52] new stuff okay your procedure
[01:08:52 - 01:08:55] prevents me from should prevent
[01:08:55 - 01:08:55] me from then saying well
[01:08:55 - 01:08:57] this computer is no good
[01:08:57 - 01:08:57] i need a new one
[01:08:58 - 01:09:01] right now so the the
[01:09:01 - 01:09:01] process that we have in
[01:09:01 - 01:09:03] place of standardizing computers will
[01:09:03 - 01:09:06] will prohibit you from just
[01:09:06 - 01:09:08] customizing a computer with the
[01:09:08 - 01:09:08] latest and greatest right so
[01:09:11 - 01:09:11] but that's not what i
[01:09:11 - 01:09:12] wanted but that's what we
[01:09:12 - 01:09:13] that's what we approve and
[01:09:13 - 01:09:13] that's why we have that
[01:09:16 - 01:09:16] process so we meet with
[01:09:16 - 01:09:19] the with the um end
[01:09:19 - 01:09:19] user and we evaluate the
[01:09:19 - 01:09:23] needs that they have for
[01:09:23 - 01:09:23] their um roles so for
[01:09:23 - 01:09:26] so we have a different
[01:09:26 - 01:09:28] levels of specifications for their
[01:09:28 - 01:09:30] computers so depending on the
[01:09:30 - 01:09:30] role uh we specify a
[01:09:32 - 01:09:32] different computer for instance if
[01:09:34 - 01:09:39] they're doing engineering um architecture
[01:09:39 - 01:09:39] or uh digital media then
[01:09:41 - 01:09:41] we have a different computer
[01:09:42 - 01:09:42] specification and packet that we
[01:09:42 - 01:09:45] offer to them and and
[01:09:45 - 01:09:48] organizationally if i understand the
[01:09:48 - 01:09:50] or the organizational leadership the
[01:09:50 - 01:09:50] department chair has skin in
[01:09:50 - 01:09:55] the game as to how
[01:09:55 - 01:09:58] often you replace what you
[01:09:58 - 01:09:58] have to replace so currently
[01:09:58 - 01:10:01] that's what we have and
[01:10:01 - 01:10:01] it is uh the the
[01:10:03 - 01:10:03] responsibility of the department budget
[01:10:06 - 01:10:06] head to evaluate that um
[01:10:06 - 01:10:09] so we don't have all
[01:10:09 - 01:10:09] of the purchases uh centralized
[01:10:12 - 01:10:12] through it but as i
[01:10:12 - 01:10:14] mentioned earlier all those other
[01:10:14 - 01:10:17] uh mechanisms helps us in
[01:10:17 - 01:10:17] uh ensuring that we we
[01:10:17 - 01:10:18] don't in uh ensuring that
[01:10:18 - 01:10:19] we we don't overspend overspend
[01:10:21 - 01:10:21] and one last question then
[01:10:21 - 01:10:24] on 4 9 how does
[01:10:24 - 01:10:24] the storage area network fit
[01:10:24 - 01:10:30] into all this so the
[01:10:30 - 01:10:30] storage error network is um
[01:10:30 - 01:10:32] it's our storage that we
[01:10:32 - 01:10:32] have in our uh data
[01:10:35 - 01:10:35] center that is used for
[01:10:35 - 01:10:39] storage for different systems so
[01:10:39 - 01:10:43] uh we have um applications
[01:10:43 - 01:10:43] that all the um the
[01:10:43 - 01:10:44] storage that data resides in
[01:10:44 - 01:10:46] there so it's centralized so
[01:10:46 - 01:10:46] that we can uh then
[01:10:50 - 01:10:50] expand it's modular um and
[01:10:50 - 01:10:52] we can um provision systems
[01:10:52 - 01:10:55] quicker as well because we
[01:10:55 - 01:10:55] we also have our our
[01:10:55 - 01:10:58] virtual servers um and that
[01:10:58 - 01:11:01] are connected to our storage
[01:11:01 - 01:11:01] era network so that we
[01:11:01 - 01:11:02] can provide and that it
[01:11:02 - 01:11:06] helps us with reliability as
[01:11:06 - 01:11:06] well so that we can
[01:11:06 - 01:11:07] um so the contracts are
[01:11:07 - 01:11:09] for both of them are
[01:11:09 - 01:11:09] for dell marketing and so
[01:11:09 - 01:11:12] they know that they're on
[01:11:12 - 01:11:12] the line for both of
[01:11:14 - 01:11:14] them so we use that
[01:11:14 - 01:11:16] as an opportunity to get
[01:11:16 - 01:11:19] them to negotiate and um
[01:11:19 - 01:11:19] i'm glad you brought that
[01:11:19 - 01:11:20] up too because we do
[01:11:20 - 01:11:23] have a good relationship with
[01:11:23 - 01:11:23] dell and we're always um
[01:11:24 - 01:11:30] requesting negotiating i guess that's
[01:11:30 - 01:11:31] the word i was looking
[01:11:31 - 01:11:33] for we're always negotiating for
[01:11:33 - 01:11:35] discounts and in this case
[01:11:35 - 01:11:35] we always take this opportunity
[01:11:35 - 01:11:37] as well having that we
[01:11:37 - 01:11:40] given that we are going
[01:11:40 - 01:11:40] to have two different uh
[01:11:40 - 01:11:42] purchases with them uh they
[01:11:42 - 01:11:45] provide uh discounts for us
[01:11:45 - 01:11:45] dr strada for us dr
[01:11:45 - 01:11:47] strada sir sir one picky
[01:11:47 - 01:11:47] point if you don't mind
[01:11:47 - 01:11:50] when we're preparing the agenda
[01:11:50 - 01:11:53] it' be neat if we
[01:11:53 - 01:11:53] had items 4 1 4
[01:11:53 - 01:11:56] 2 4 3 marco marco
[01:11:56 - 01:11:56] marco marco and then we
[01:11:56 - 01:11:58] go to mr fernandez who
[01:11:58 - 01:11:58] has i have a question
[01:12:01 - 01:12:01] for when but you know
[01:12:01 - 01:12:03] rather than bounce around area
[01:12:03 - 01:12:06] concern around area concern understood
[01:12:06 - 01:12:09] understood any other discussion all
[01:12:09 - 01:12:10] the questions mr uxer mr
[01:12:10 - 01:12:11] uxer i i mrs robless
[01:12:11 - 01:12:13] mrs robless hi hi miss

[01:12:22 - 01:12:22] 4 3 discussion and action
[01:12:22 - 01:12:24] on the approval to award
[01:12:24 - 01:12:27] contracts to odp business solutions
[01:12:27 - 01:12:29] llc and el paso office
[01:12:29 - 01:12:30] products llc for the district-wide
[01:12:30 - 01:12:32] purchase of office products in
[01:12:32 - 01:12:32] an amount not to exceed
[01:12:32 - 01:12:33] products in an amount not
[01:12:33 - 01:12:34] to exceed 650 000 650
[01:12:34 - 01:12:38] 000 estimated annual aggregate amount
[01:12:40 - 01:12:42] move to approve second any
[01:12:42 - 01:12:43] discussion any discussion yes yes
[01:12:47 - 01:12:47] mr flores i presume out
[01:12:47 - 01:12:49] of all this when i
[01:12:49 - 01:12:53] see the word and you
[01:12:53 - 01:12:53] know 650 and the word
[01:12:53 - 01:12:55] aggregate makes what kind of
[01:12:55 - 01:12:57] monitoring program i mean if
[01:12:57 - 01:12:57] it's aggregate and we sort
[01:12:57 - 01:12:59] of have it there you
[01:12:59 - 01:13:01] know how do we monitor
[01:13:01 - 01:13:01] make sure that i mean
[01:13:03 - 01:13:03] it doesn't it seems like
[01:13:03 - 01:13:05] it's not specified so we
[01:13:05 - 01:13:05] can't track it so how
[01:13:10 - 01:13:10] do we know that you
[01:13:10 - 01:13:10] know that uh we have
[01:13:12 - 01:13:12] good managerial financial control over
[01:13:14 - 01:13:14] all of this if we're
[01:13:14 - 01:13:16] if an aggregate so that
[01:13:16 - 01:13:16] the aggregate will say yes
[01:13:16 - 01:13:20] it's been used wisely good
[01:13:20 - 01:13:20] question mr ruxer we have
[01:13:22 - 01:13:22] significant internal controls built into
[01:13:25 - 01:13:25] our erp system so our
[01:13:25 - 01:13:27] method of budgeting uh line
[01:13:27 - 01:13:30] item budgeting for the supplies
[01:13:30 - 01:13:30] pool in this particular example
[01:13:33 - 01:13:33] will not allow a requisition
[01:13:33 - 01:13:35] to go through if the
[01:13:35 - 01:13:38] funds are not available it'll
[01:13:38 - 01:13:38] uh it'll show a flag
[01:13:38 - 01:13:41] of non-sufficient funds which will
[01:13:41 - 01:13:44] cause the potential purchase to
[01:13:44 - 01:13:47] be questioned in addition to
[01:13:47 - 01:13:47] that our uh method of
[01:13:50 - 01:13:50] control for receiving uh goods
[01:13:50 - 01:13:52] and services for whatever the
[01:13:52 - 01:13:55] category is but in particular
[01:13:55 - 01:13:55] uh we do not allow
[01:13:55 - 01:13:57] for delivery of goods and
[01:13:57 - 01:14:00] services except for to college
[01:14:00 - 01:14:03] premises so nobody can divert
[01:14:03 - 01:14:06] purchases to their homes or
[01:14:06 - 01:14:08] another location uh in this
[01:14:08 - 01:14:12] particular example supplies uh our
[01:14:12 - 01:14:12] our method of budgeting uh
[01:14:12 - 01:14:15] as a good example for
[01:14:15 - 01:14:18] the instructional area we have
[01:14:18 - 01:14:18] five campuses so there are
[01:14:21 - 01:14:21] redundant budgets like we'll have
[01:14:23 - 01:14:23] english department at a different
[01:14:27 - 01:14:27] location which will uh allow
[01:14:27 - 01:14:30] for closer scrutiny of budgets
[01:14:30 - 01:14:32] uh as opposed to aggregating
[01:14:32 - 01:14:32] all the supplies into one
[01:14:34 - 01:14:34] english budget we'll have a
[01:14:34 - 01:14:36] separate english budget budget for
[01:14:36 - 01:14:39] different programs uh we have
[01:14:39 - 01:14:44] about over 600 budgets which
[01:14:44 - 01:14:47] allow for closer scrutiny okay
[01:14:47 - 01:14:47] just now if we if
[01:14:47 - 01:14:49] we deliver to the different
[01:14:49 - 01:14:49] locations how can we you
[01:14:52 - 01:14:52] know once it comes to
[01:14:52 - 01:14:54] the campus then how do
[01:14:54 - 01:14:54] we what control we have
[01:14:54 - 01:14:56] when it brings in and
[01:14:56 - 01:14:56] you have 14 boxes of
[01:14:59 - 01:14:59] paper pencils and and toner
[01:14:59 - 01:15:02] and it goes into some
[01:15:02 - 01:15:02] extra office there and then
[01:15:05 - 01:15:05] anybody can you know from
[01:15:05 - 01:15:06] personal anybody can you know
[01:15:06 - 01:15:09] from personal experience experience somebody
[01:15:09 - 01:15:09] i happen to know when
[01:15:09 - 01:15:11] they used to work as
[01:15:11 - 01:15:12] an engineer actually to work
[01:15:12 - 01:15:13] as an engineer actually accumulated
[01:15:13 - 01:15:17] accumulated bunches of extra pads
[01:15:17 - 01:15:18] of paper and other items
[01:15:18 - 01:15:18] so that they become the
[01:15:18 - 01:15:20] central warehouse for their particular
[01:15:20 - 01:15:22] work location as opposed to
[01:15:22 - 01:15:24] the secretary keeping it i
[01:15:24 - 01:15:24] mean what kind of control
[01:15:26 - 01:15:26] do we have to make
[01:15:26 - 01:15:27] sure that everybody doesn't have
[01:15:27 - 01:15:28] four or five extra copies
[01:15:29 - 01:15:29] of whatever they have there
[01:15:32 - 01:15:32] well that that re is
[01:15:32 - 01:15:35] dependent on the on the
[01:15:35 - 01:15:35] budget head um the budget
[01:15:35 - 01:15:38] has to exercise control for
[01:15:38 - 01:15:40] those resources within the department
[01:15:40 - 01:15:44] where where the supplies go
[01:15:44 - 01:15:44] is very specific to the
[01:15:46 - 01:15:46] vendor to deliver to a
[01:15:46 - 01:15:50] very specific room and person
[01:15:50 - 01:15:50] so appropriate use is a
[01:15:51 - 01:15:53] managerial function yes sir yes
[01:15:55 - 01:16:01] sir interesting that's a big
[01:16:01 - 01:16:01] number to have spread out

[01:16:02 - 01:16:03] have spread out everywhere everywhere

[01:17:51 - 01:17:52] for a three-year period any
[01:17:52 - 01:17:56] discussion yes on 4 6
[01:17:56 - 01:17:57] it's microsoft which is essentially
[01:17:57 - 01:18:00] a software function and then
[01:18:00 - 01:18:00] we see fire print 7
[01:18:00 - 01:18:01] is a software are there
[01:18:01 - 01:18:01] any coordination is there any
[01:18:03 - 01:18:03] overlap is there any relationship
[01:18:06 - 01:18:06] between these two or they
[01:18:06 - 01:18:08] just need to be independent
[01:18:08 - 01:18:10] treated independently separately won't you
[01:18:10 - 01:18:13] ask dr pinley to answer
[01:18:13 - 01:18:14] i'm sorry i'll go ahead
[01:18:14 - 01:18:14] and and take this thank
[01:18:17 - 01:18:17] you for your question uh
[01:18:17 - 01:18:20] mr ruxer so they are
[01:18:20 - 01:18:22] two separate um applications so
[01:18:22 - 01:18:22] um the microsoft that you
[01:18:22 - 01:18:24] see here the abstract is
[01:18:24 - 01:18:26] for requests of support it's
[01:18:26 - 01:18:29] not necessarily the licences licenses
[01:18:29 - 01:18:29] those you approved last uh
[01:18:29 - 01:18:32] last month last board meeting
[01:18:32 - 01:18:34] um this is just for
[01:18:34 - 01:18:34] support so that we can
[01:18:34 - 01:18:37] get uh proactive uh support
[01:18:37 - 01:18:41] from them as well as
[01:18:41 - 01:18:41] um prioritize support and it
[01:18:41 - 01:18:44] just helps us to maintain
[01:18:44 - 01:18:47] our systems um and operational
[01:18:47 - 01:18:47] and it reduces also by
[01:18:49 - 01:18:49] having the support it it
[01:18:49 - 01:18:52] augments our staff and so
[01:18:52 - 01:18:52] it it allows us to
[01:18:52 - 01:18:54] have whenever there's a an
[01:18:54 - 01:18:59] issue that needs to be
[01:18:59 - 01:18:59] re repaired or or fixed
[01:18:59 - 01:19:01] uh for um a faster
[01:19:01 - 01:19:01] response time to address that
[01:19:01 - 01:19:02] a faster response time to
[01:19:02 - 01:19:05] address that issue issue so
[01:19:05 - 01:19:05] they're really not even comparable
[01:19:07 - 01:19:09] type or operations and no

[01:20:46 - 01:20:50] any discussion yes yes we
[01:20:50 - 01:20:50] talked about the elevators in
[01:20:50 - 01:20:52] in a previous day and
[01:20:54 - 01:20:54] i think one of the
[01:20:54 - 01:20:56] things that we wanted to
[01:20:56 - 01:20:56] look at was what was
[01:20:56 - 01:20:59] the usage or the need
[01:20:59 - 01:20:59] established and i think the
[01:21:01 - 01:21:01] agreement was there but we
[01:21:01 - 01:21:05] really didn't know if it
[01:21:05 - 01:21:05] was more of a a
[01:21:07 - 01:21:07] medical compl what is the
[01:21:07 - 01:21:09] compliance issue or if it
[01:21:09 - 01:21:09] was an actual issue what
[01:21:12 - 01:21:12] where do we stand on
[01:21:12 - 01:21:13] the certification and justification for
[01:21:13 - 01:21:16] those so with regards uh
[01:21:16 - 01:21:17] i'll i'll begin and i'll
[01:21:17 - 01:21:17] ask mr footus to weigh
[01:21:17 - 01:21:20] in as well with with
[01:21:20 - 01:21:20] regards mr oxer to uh
[01:21:20 - 01:21:22] the need the need is
[01:21:22 - 01:21:25] is absolutely there we've had
[01:21:25 - 01:21:28] unfortunately where um the elevators
[01:21:28 - 01:21:28] are unfunctional um we've had
[01:21:31 - 01:21:31] students as well as faculty
[01:21:31 - 01:21:33] and or staff um that
[01:21:33 - 01:21:33] were not um did not
[01:21:33 - 01:21:35] have the capacity to utilize
[01:21:35 - 01:21:38] the stairs um whether it
[01:21:38 - 01:21:38] be an ada issue uh
[01:21:38 - 01:21:40] an injury what have you
[01:21:40 - 01:21:43] and so um the need
[01:21:43 - 01:21:43] is absolutely there with regards
[01:21:43 - 01:21:45] to increasing the capacity and
[01:21:45 - 01:21:47] and providing additional elevators in
[01:21:47 - 01:21:49] those respective buildings i'm pleased
[01:21:49 - 01:21:53] to say that um initial
[01:21:53 - 01:21:53] estimates ran as high as
[01:21:57 - 01:21:57] 8 5 million for for
[01:21:57 - 01:21:58] this renovation um the elevators
[01:21:58 - 01:21:58] are that are in those
[01:22:01 - 01:22:01] buildings are the original elevators
[01:22:01 - 01:22:05] um they are um a
[01:22:05 - 01:22:05] system that is no longer
[01:22:09 - 01:22:09] supported um by uh are
[01:22:09 - 01:22:11] no longer utilized in in
[01:22:11 - 01:22:13] construction so it's very difficult
[01:22:13 - 01:22:16] to fix the current elevators
[01:22:16 - 01:22:16] if and when they are
[01:22:16 - 01:22:18] out um these would allow
[01:22:18 - 01:22:20] us to have additional elevators
[01:22:20 - 01:22:20] as uh support for those
[01:22:23 - 01:22:23] respective buildings uh again pleased
[01:22:26 - 01:22:26] to see that the that
[01:22:26 - 01:22:29] the bid that the board
[01:22:29 - 01:22:29] will um go forward with
[01:22:29 - 01:22:31] for medlock commercial contractors came
[01:22:31 - 01:22:34] in just over 5 million
[01:22:34 - 01:22:37] um it is a one-year
[01:22:37 - 01:22:40] uh 360day uh construction time
[01:22:40 - 01:22:42] period which we anticipate will
[01:22:42 - 01:22:42] begin on the 1st of
[01:22:45 - 01:22:45] september um so we feel
[01:22:45 - 01:22:47] very comfortable with the need
[01:22:47 - 01:22:50] the justification and the move
[01:22:50 - 01:22:52] forward on this um a
[01:22:52 - 01:22:52] lot of kudos to ruben
[01:22:55 - 01:22:55] gallardo and mr flores on
[01:22:55 - 01:22:58] being able to move this
[01:22:58 - 01:22:58] forward their teams um we
[01:23:01 - 01:23:01] first discussed the elevators um
[01:23:01 - 01:23:03] a couple of years ago
[01:23:03 - 01:23:03] so it is good to
[01:23:05 - 01:23:05] be at this point where
[01:23:05 - 01:23:08] we're moving forward with construction
[01:23:08 - 01:23:11] u but these buildings were
[01:23:11 - 01:23:13] built in the mid70s um
[01:23:13 - 01:23:13] these buildings uh these are
[01:23:13 - 01:23:15] the original elevators that are
[01:23:15 - 01:23:18] in those respective buildings so
[01:23:18 - 01:23:20] no doubt on the justification
[01:23:20 - 01:23:20] and need for them mr
[01:23:21 - 01:23:21] flores please add to anything
[01:23:21 - 01:23:22] that i flores please add
[01:23:22 - 01:23:23] to anything that i missed
[01:23:23 - 01:23:26] missed no dr s i
[01:23:26 - 01:23:26] thought that was quite a
[01:23:28 - 01:23:28] complete answer uh in addition
[01:23:28 - 01:23:31] to that we find that
[01:23:31 - 01:23:31] we sometimes we need them
[01:23:35 - 01:23:35] to move freight and so
[01:23:35 - 01:23:40] this plan will give us
[01:23:40 - 01:23:40] two elevators for building a
[01:23:40 - 01:23:43] b and c each so
[01:23:43 - 01:23:45] we'll be able to segregate
[01:23:45 - 01:23:45] the freight part of moving
[01:23:48 - 01:23:48] things to different levels and
[01:23:48 - 01:23:51] also we have had incidents
[01:23:51 - 01:23:53] where people have been trapped
[01:23:53 - 01:23:58] in those elevators because of
[01:23:58 - 01:23:58] age and um ability to
[01:23:58 - 01:24:01] maintain them so th this
[01:24:01 - 01:24:01] is a very important need
[01:24:01 - 01:24:11] in any other discussion other
[01:24:11 - 01:24:13] questions mr her mr her
[01:24:13 - 01:24:15] i i mrs robiss miss

[01:24:35 - 01:24:38] 2026 move to approve move
[01:24:38 - 01:24:41] to approve second second any
[01:24:41 - 01:24:43] discussion just a quick question
[01:24:46 - 01:24:46] this is just sort of
[01:24:46 - 01:24:50] an anticipated usage it's already
[01:24:50 - 01:24:52] an existing planned to budgetary
[01:24:52 - 01:24:52] item i guess is that
[01:24:52 - 01:24:55] and so it's just it's
[01:24:55 - 01:24:55] now coming due that we
[01:24:57 - 01:24:57] need the stuff supplies is
[01:24:57 - 01:24:58] that it it is it
[01:24:58 - 01:25:01] is okay okay it it
[01:25:01 - 01:25:01] allows us mr drugs are
[01:25:01 - 01:25:04] um to have these contracts
[01:25:04 - 01:25:04] in place in that if
[01:25:04 - 01:25:06] we have an emergency on
[01:25:06 - 01:25:08] a one of our respective
[01:25:08 - 01:25:08] campus or a need to
[01:25:08 - 01:25:11] move forward with any um
[01:25:11 - 01:25:14] repair with any contract that
[01:25:14 - 01:25:14] we're allowed to move that
[01:25:16 - 01:25:16] forward as opposed to waiting
[01:25:16 - 01:25:18] till the next board meeting
[01:25:18 - 01:25:20] as well to approve the
[01:25:20 - 01:25:20] contract which then we'd have
[01:25:20 - 01:25:22] to do the rfp at
[01:25:22 - 01:25:22] that point move forward wait
[01:25:25 - 01:25:25] the period of time it
[01:25:25 - 01:25:27] it prevents the college from
[01:25:27 - 01:25:27] delays and being able to
[01:25:30 - 01:25:30] move forward um between the
[01:25:30 - 01:25:32] last board meeting and now
[01:25:32 - 01:25:32] we have dealt with water
[01:25:35 - 01:25:35] issues at the northwest campus
[01:25:35 - 01:25:39] uh we have dealt with
[01:25:39 - 01:25:39] um a variety of issues
[01:25:41 - 01:25:41] at each of our respective
[01:25:41 - 01:25:46] campuses um ac at at
[01:25:46 - 01:25:46] the rio grand campus and
[01:25:46 - 01:25:48] the staff um in particular
[01:25:48 - 01:25:50] the folks in the front
[01:25:50 - 01:25:50] have been dealing with those
[01:25:52 - 01:25:52] respective issues and ensuring that
[01:25:52 - 01:25:54] the college can continue its
[01:25:54 - 01:25:56] functionality continue to serve the
[01:25:56 - 01:25:59] students that we're fortunate to
[01:25:59 - 01:26:01] have enrolled at the institution
[01:26:01 - 01:26:01] without having to come to
[01:26:03 - 01:26:03] the board meeting every single
[01:26:03 - 01:26:05] time now if it's an
[01:26:05 - 01:26:07] expenditure that is beyond any
[01:26:07 - 01:26:07] of these we still come
[01:26:07 - 01:26:10] back to the board but

[01:27:58 - 01:27:58] so for a little context
[01:27:58 - 01:28:01] um last year we were
[01:28:01 - 01:28:03] awarded a planning grant uh
[01:28:03 - 01:28:03] in in the neighborhood of
[01:28:03 - 01:28:06] 100 000 so faculty have
[01:28:06 - 01:28:09] been working along with uh
[01:28:09 - 01:28:09] five total schools four other
[01:28:11 - 01:28:11] partners in the state to
[01:28:11 - 01:28:13] develop the program uh the
[01:28:13 - 01:28:15] competencies for the opportunity high
[01:28:15 - 01:28:17] school diploma program uh this
[01:28:17 - 01:28:19] year they're developing the curriculum
[01:28:19 - 01:28:19] so there is no participation
[01:28:22 - 01:28:22] at this point we anticipate
[01:28:22 - 01:28:24] the first cohort to come
[01:28:24 - 01:28:27] in in the spring and
[01:28:27 - 01:28:27] do you have a number
[01:28:29 - 01:28:29] uh we're hoping to get
[01:28:29 - 01:28:29] a cohort of 20 to
[01:28:31 - 01:28:31] 25 to to start out
[01:28:31 - 01:28:31] 25 to to start out
[01:28:31 - 01:28:34] okay okay it's not a
[01:28:34 - 01:28:36] one zero two zero no
[01:28:36 - 01:28:36] absolutely not and we think
[01:28:36 - 01:28:38] there's considerable growth potential in
[01:28:38 - 01:28:40] our region there there are
[01:28:40 - 01:28:42] a lot of individuals that
[01:28:42 - 01:28:44] have for whatever reason dropped
[01:28:44 - 01:28:44] out of high school are
[01:28:44 - 01:28:46] in the workforce now but
[01:28:46 - 01:28:48] would benefit from coming back
[01:28:48 - 01:28:51] completing their high school diploma
[01:28:51 - 01:28:51] and earning a college degree
[01:28:51 - 01:28:51] or diploma and earning a
[01:28:51 - 01:28:51] college degree or certificate certificate
[01:28:54 - 01:28:54] how does this differ from
[01:28:54 - 01:28:58] a gte so the ged
[01:28:58 - 01:28:58] is yeah uh is one
[01:28:58 - 01:29:01] avenue for someone to show
[01:29:01 - 01:29:03] completion of high school um
[01:29:03 - 01:29:03] some folks don't have a
[01:29:04 - 01:29:06] ged or a high school
[01:29:06 - 01:29:09] diploma so the state felt
[01:29:09 - 01:29:09] uh that an opportunity to
[01:29:09 - 01:29:12] get a diploma might be
[01:29:12 - 01:29:12] better than a ged we
[01:29:13 - 01:29:13] also have ged programs at
[01:29:14 - 01:29:14] the also have ged programs
[01:29:14 - 01:29:15] at the institution institution institution
[01:29:16 - 01:29:18] okay okay and this is
[01:29:18 - 01:29:18] uh the state found another
[01:29:20 - 01:29:20] uh pot of money so
[01:29:20 - 01:29:22] they've divided up that up
[01:29:22 - 01:29:22] amongst the five partners and
[01:29:25 - 01:29:25] our share is 33 000
[01:29:25 - 01:29:28] and we'll be using that
[01:29:28 - 01:29:28] predominantly to uh market the
[01:29:30 - 01:29:30] program but this is this
[01:29:30 - 01:29:32] is focused on getting a
[01:29:32 - 01:29:32] ticket puncher if you will
[01:29:35 - 01:29:35] out and so that it
[01:29:35 - 01:29:38] helps people get get further
[01:29:38 - 01:29:40] their personal career that's absolutely
[01:29:40 - 01:29:42] correct not only for their
[01:29:42 - 01:29:42] high school diploma but to
[01:29:42 - 01:29:46] earn a college credential at
[01:29:46 - 01:29:49] the same time y any
[01:29:49 - 01:29:49] other questions call a any
