[00:09:18 - 00:09:18] good afternoon everyone thank you
[00:09:18 - 00:09:22] for allowing me to present
[00:09:22 - 00:09:23] this um where with painting
[00:09:23 - 00:09:24] of rionis mcdaniel as he
[00:09:27 - 00:09:27] said and we were charged
[00:09:27 - 00:09:30] to do what's called an
[00:09:30 - 00:09:30] agreed upon procedure uh the
[00:09:33 - 00:09:33] board a couple years ago
[00:09:33 - 00:09:36] ordered that um a student
[00:09:36 - 00:09:36] endowment success fund uh be
[00:09:40 - 00:09:40] created and then we ordered
[00:09:40 - 00:09:43] to look at the attributes
[00:09:43 - 00:09:47] that were challenged to the
[00:09:47 - 00:09:47] management and see if they
[00:09:47 - 00:09:48] were done and so what
[00:09:48 - 00:09:48] i have in front of
[00:09:48 - 00:09:49] you and don't worry i'm
[00:09:49 - 00:09:50] not going to go through
[00:09:52 - 00:09:52] every word on every page
[00:09:52 - 00:09:54] but i'd like to just
[00:09:54 - 00:09:54] give a quick synopsis of
[00:09:54 - 00:09:56] each of the directives the
[00:09:56 - 00:09:58] board said to do this
[00:09:58 - 00:09:58] did they do it the
[00:09:58 - 00:10:00] board just said to do
[00:10:00 - 00:10:00] that did they do that
[00:10:00 - 00:10:02] so i'll quickly run through
[00:10:02 - 00:10:04] some of these but i
[00:10:04 - 00:10:04] will pay attention to one
[00:10:04 - 00:10:07] specific item of specific interest
[00:10:07 - 00:10:10] so first of all the
[00:10:10 - 00:10:12] student success endowment fund on
[00:10:12 - 00:10:12] april 2023 the board directed
[00:10:12 - 00:10:15] the college to create a
[00:10:15 - 00:10:18] student success endowment fund the
[00:10:18 - 00:10:20] fund was created on may
[00:10:20 - 00:10:22] uh 28 25 the board
[00:10:22 - 00:10:26] of trustees received an amendment
[00:10:26 - 00:10:26] to that establishment and the
[00:10:29 - 00:10:33] amendment is uh required that
[00:10:33 - 00:10:33] the 90 of the original
[00:10:33 - 00:10:37] interest that was originally stated
[00:10:37 - 00:10:40] shall be used for scholarship
[00:10:40 - 00:10:43] to say shall be allocated
[00:10:43 - 00:10:45] to scholarships so basically instead
[00:10:45 - 00:10:45] of ordering every year you
[00:10:45 - 00:10:47] have to do this every
[00:10:47 - 00:10:49] year we're going to allocate
[00:10:49 - 00:10:49] the interest to it and
[00:10:49 - 00:10:52] then secondly the amendment modified
[00:10:52 - 00:10:55] the original language to be
[00:10:55 - 00:10:58] um to be directed at
[00:10:58 - 00:11:01] the discretion of the executive
[00:11:01 - 00:11:03] committee instead of bringing it
[00:11:03 - 00:11:03] to the full board so
[00:11:03 - 00:11:06] relieving the full board of
[00:11:06 - 00:11:11] that requirement and both of
[00:11:11 - 00:11:11] those were done um as
[00:11:11 - 00:11:13] required so moving on to
[00:11:13 - 00:11:15] the next one the establishment
[00:11:15 - 00:11:15] of the endowment uh the
[00:11:17 - 00:11:17] objective was to determine if
[00:11:17 - 00:11:19] the college did establish an
[00:11:19 - 00:11:22] endowment and the final observation
[00:11:22 - 00:11:24] was yes the student success
[00:11:24 - 00:11:29] endowment fund was created on
[00:11:29 - 00:11:29] august 30th of 2023 and
[00:11:29 - 00:11:31] that date does become important
[00:11:31 - 00:11:34] a little bit later um
[00:11:34 - 00:11:34] the next one were deposits
[00:11:34 - 00:11:37] of funds we're giving you
[00:11:37 - 00:11:40] 30 million the objective was
[00:11:40 - 00:11:40] to verify that 30 million
[00:11:44 - 00:11:44] was deposited into the student
[00:11:44 - 00:11:46] success endowment fund and what
[00:11:46 - 00:11:49] we did determine or identify
[00:11:49 - 00:11:51] is that the initial deposit
[00:11:51 - 00:11:56] into the endowment fund was
[00:11:56 - 00:11:56] made on august 28th of
[00:11:56 - 00:12:00] 2024 for 33 million 37317
[00:12:03 - 00:12:05] the original 30 million uh
[00:12:05 - 00:12:05] plus acred interest from the
[00:12:05 - 00:12:08] date that the funds were
[00:12:08 - 00:12:08] received of 3 that the
[00:12:09 - 00:12:11] funds were received of 3
[00:12:11 - 00:12:13] million37317 so the entire amount
[00:12:13 - 00:12:18] from the date of inception
[00:12:18 - 00:12:18] to the date that the
[00:12:18 - 00:12:20] fund was established was transferred
[00:12:20 - 00:12:23] into the endowment fund the
[00:12:23 - 00:12:25] next one was the investment
[00:12:25 - 00:12:25] of the funds the objective
[00:12:27 - 00:12:27] was to verify that they
[00:12:27 - 00:12:29] were vest invested based on
[00:12:29 - 00:12:33] the directive of the board
[00:12:33 - 00:12:33] of dire of directors and
[00:12:33 - 00:12:35] on the observation on the
[00:12:35 - 00:12:35] next page was that on
[00:12:38 - 00:12:38] august 28th the funds were
[00:12:38 - 00:12:41] transferred to local government pool
[00:12:41 - 00:12:45] this was back on 28
[00:12:45 - 00:12:45] of of 24 to the
[00:12:45 - 00:12:48] text pool and the remainder
[00:12:48 - 00:12:48] of the account as of
[00:12:48 - 00:12:51] august 24 was there uh
[00:12:51 - 00:12:53] before the transfer the funds
[00:12:53 - 00:12:53] were held in the text
[00:12:53 - 00:12:55] pool account with the college
[00:12:55 - 00:12:57] funds so they were co-mingled
[00:12:57 - 00:12:59] but they were tracked separately
[00:12:59 - 00:12:59] so even though the funds
[00:13:02 - 00:13:02] weren't transferable into the fund
[00:13:02 - 00:13:05] um originally they were tracked
[00:13:05 - 00:13:07] separately so yes the investment
[00:13:07 - 00:13:10] funds are uh followed with
[00:13:10 - 00:13:13] the board directives uh was
[00:13:13 - 00:13:15] an executive committee established and
[00:13:15 - 00:13:15] as required by the trustees
[00:13:15 - 00:13:19] and the answer is yes
[00:13:19 - 00:13:19] on february 29 2024 the
[00:13:21 - 00:13:21] board of trustees appointed the
[00:13:24 - 00:13:24] executive committee of the student
[00:13:27 - 00:13:27] success endowment fund keeping on
[00:13:27 - 00:13:29] going a scholarship selection committee
[00:13:29 - 00:13:32] and on top of the
[00:13:32 - 00:13:35] executive committee that the president
[00:13:35 - 00:13:35] was directed to appoint a
[00:13:38 - 00:13:38] committee that directly reports to
[00:13:38 - 00:13:40] the executive committee and again
[00:13:40 - 00:13:43] on the next page the
[00:13:43 - 00:13:44] observation that was that during
[00:13:44 - 00:13:47] the first executive committee meeting
[00:13:47 - 00:13:50] on 2024 uh the scholarship
[00:13:50 - 00:13:54] select committee was established on
[00:13:54 - 00:13:54] april 29th 2024 the team
[00:13:56 - 00:13:59] developed the eligibility scholarship criteria
[00:13:59 - 00:14:01] the scholarship committee then first
[00:14:01 - 00:14:01] met with the executive committee
[00:14:04 - 00:14:04] on may of 2024 to
[00:14:04 - 00:14:06] discuss the eligibility and the
[00:14:06 - 00:14:08] scholarship selection committee was present
[00:14:08 - 00:14:11] with the executive committees on
[00:14:11 - 00:14:13] the upcoming meetings so the
[00:14:13 - 00:14:16] answer is yes that objective
[00:14:16 - 00:14:16] was achieved uh then uh
[00:14:18 - 00:14:18] presentation by the executive committee
[00:14:21 - 00:14:21] to the board of directors
[00:14:21 - 00:14:23] again uh to determine that
[00:14:23 - 00:14:23] at the first meeting of
[00:14:26 - 00:14:26] the board of directors uh
[00:14:26 - 00:14:29] that the and at the
[00:14:29 - 00:14:29] annual meetings a report would
[00:14:29 - 00:14:31] be presented basically part of
[00:14:31 - 00:14:33] what i'm doing now the
[00:14:33 - 00:14:37] executive committee first did present
[00:14:37 - 00:14:37] to the board of trustees
[00:14:37 - 00:14:41] um on september 24 of
[00:14:41 - 00:14:41] 20 september 24th of on
[00:14:41 - 00:14:42] september 24 of 20 september
[00:14:42 - 00:14:45] 24th of 2024 2024 u
[00:14:45 - 00:14:45] so the presentation was they
[00:14:45 - 00:14:48] again object to completed a
[00:14:48 - 00:14:51] presentation by the executive committee
[00:14:51 - 00:14:53] to the boards to the
[00:14:53 - 00:14:53] college president to determine that
[00:14:56 - 00:14:56] the executive committee was providing
[00:14:56 - 00:14:58] a report to the president
[00:14:58 - 00:15:01] and the board of trustees
[00:15:01 - 00:15:01] at least annually and again
[00:15:01 - 00:15:02] the observation was that the
[00:15:02 - 00:15:05] first presentation by the executive
[00:15:05 - 00:15:08] committee to the board of
[00:15:08 - 00:15:12] trustees was done on september
[00:15:12 - 00:15:12] of 2024 objective achieved um
[00:15:15 - 00:15:15] then the corpus fund the
[00:15:15 - 00:15:17] objective was to verify that
[00:15:17 - 00:15:17] the corpus fund was not
[00:15:21 - 00:15:21] spent um the objective to
[00:15:21 - 00:15:24] verify the corpus funds were
[00:15:24 - 00:15:28] not spent during the fiscal
[00:15:28 - 00:15:28] year of 2024 the observation
[00:15:28 - 00:15:31] was that and this is
[00:15:31 - 00:15:34] the corpus the observation is
[00:15:34 - 00:15:34] that the 30 million of
[00:15:36 - 00:15:39] the corpus initial donation was
[00:15:39 - 00:15:42] made on 2021 the board
[00:15:42 - 00:15:42] resolution stated that the student
[00:15:46 - 00:15:46] success fund should transfer the
[00:15:46 - 00:15:49] funds uh and they were
[00:15:49 - 00:15:53] transferred on august of 2024
[00:15:53 - 00:15:53] for the 33 million37 that
[00:15:53 - 00:15:57] i mentioned earlier the fund
[00:15:57 - 00:15:59] included interest earned and they
[00:15:59 - 00:16:02] were tracked separately in the
[00:16:02 - 00:16:05] accounting records since the donation
[00:16:05 - 00:16:08] was received the 33 million
[00:16:08 - 00:16:11] includes interest earned since the
[00:16:11 - 00:16:11] date the donation was made
[00:16:11 - 00:16:13] as of august 2024 the
[00:16:13 - 00:16:17] text pool account had the
[00:16:17 - 00:16:19] full 33 056 so yes
[00:16:19 - 00:16:19] the 33 million corpus was
[00:16:23 - 00:16:23] retained and the extra 3
[00:16:23 - 00:16:26] million is also in there
[00:16:26 - 00:16:26] then the next one this
[00:16:28 - 00:16:28] is where if i can
[00:16:28 - 00:16:28] spend a little bit of
[00:16:30 - 00:16:30] time because we'll need a
[00:16:30 - 00:16:32] i think there'll be a
[00:16:32 - 00:16:34] presentation for suggestion from the
[00:16:34 - 00:16:36] board an allocation of scholarship
[00:16:36 - 00:16:39] and determination of the funds
[00:16:39 - 00:16:39] available the objective was to
[00:16:43 - 00:16:43] verify that 90 of the
[00:16:43 - 00:16:48] interest acred during the fiscal
[00:16:48 - 00:16:51] year ending august 24 from
[00:16:51 - 00:16:51] the student success endowment fund
[00:16:55 - 00:16:55] was allocated to the scholarships
[00:16:55 - 00:16:56] to students of the el
[00:16:56 - 00:16:57] paso community students of the
[00:16:57 - 00:16:58] el paso community college college
[00:17:01 - 00:17:01] the issue is that this
[00:17:01 - 00:17:04] is saying that 90 of
[00:17:04 - 00:17:04] the interest earned from the
[00:17:07 - 00:17:07] student success endowment fund well
[00:17:11 - 00:17:11] the success endowment fund was
[00:17:11 - 00:17:13] created a few couple years
[00:17:13 - 00:17:15] after the initial deposit so
[00:17:15 - 00:17:15] if you jump down to
[00:17:16 - 00:17:18] the observation the first scholarship
[00:17:20 - 00:17:20] awarded from the student success
[00:17:20 - 00:17:22] fund is done in the
[00:17:22 - 00:17:25] subsequent year october of 2024
[00:17:25 - 00:17:25] so no scholarships were awarded
[00:17:28 - 00:17:28] during this fiscal year but
[00:17:28 - 00:17:31] if you'll jump down the
[00:17:31 - 00:17:34] resolution states that 90 of
[00:17:34 - 00:17:36] any interest accured every fiscal
[00:17:36 - 00:17:38] year from the student success
[00:17:38 - 00:17:41] endowment fund should be allocated
[00:17:41 - 00:17:42] to the scholarship of the
[00:17:42 - 00:17:43] allocated to the scholarship of
[00:17:43 - 00:17:44] the 3 184 3 184
[00:17:47 - 00:17:47] that's the interest earned from
[00:17:47 - 00:17:49] the date the funds were
[00:17:49 - 00:17:49] received and the to the
[00:17:53 - 00:17:53] date that the deposit was
[00:17:53 - 00:17:54] made of the date that
[00:17:54 - 00:17:54] the deposit was made of
[00:17:55 - 00:17:55] the 3 100 3 100
[00:17:55 - 00:17:57] 3 100 1 79 1
[00:17:57 - 00:18:00] 79 actually represents interest earned
[00:18:00 - 00:18:02] from the date of inception
[00:18:06 - 00:18:06] to the date that the
[00:18:06 - 00:18:06] fund was actually to the
[00:18:07 - 00:18:08] date that the fund was
[00:18:08 - 00:18:13] actually created created the remaining
[00:18:13 - 00:18:16] 1 475 represents interest earned
[00:18:16 - 00:18:18] prior to the date of
[00:18:18 - 00:18:18] the creation of the student
[00:18:21 - 00:18:21] success fund so what we're
[00:18:21 - 00:18:24] doing is splitting hairs here
[00:18:24 - 00:18:27] that the the funds were
[00:18:27 - 00:18:27] deposited it earned 3 million
[00:18:31 - 00:18:31] but well not but 1
[00:18:31 - 00:18:31] 4 million of that 3
[00:18:33 - 00:18:33] million was earned prior to
[00:18:33 - 00:18:36] the establishment of the fund
[00:18:36 - 00:18:39] and because the resolution says
[00:18:39 - 00:18:44] earnings from the fund should
[00:18:44 - 00:18:44] be allocated to the um
[00:18:44 - 00:18:47] to the scholarship a question
[00:18:47 - 00:18:50] arises what happens to the
[00:18:50 - 00:18:53] 1 million400 that was earned
[00:18:53 - 00:18:55] prior to the establishment of
[00:18:55 - 00:18:58] fund picking words here and
[00:18:58 - 00:18:58] splitting airs so i think
[00:18:58 - 00:19:01] to make everything so that
[00:19:01 - 00:19:04] the board or management knows
[00:19:04 - 00:19:04] what to do with those
[00:19:07 - 00:19:07] 1 4 four the question
[00:19:07 - 00:19:13] arises should this pre-establishment of
[00:19:13 - 00:19:13] fund earnings be put into
[00:19:13 - 00:19:16] the corpus of the 3
[00:19:16 - 00:19:16] million or can it and
[00:19:16 - 00:19:18] i believe that's probably what
[00:19:18 - 00:19:20] the board wanted or can
[00:19:20 - 00:19:24] it go into the scholarship
[00:19:24 - 00:19:24] available interest for scholarship available
[00:19:25 - 00:19:28] interest for scholarships scholarships and
[00:19:28 - 00:19:28] that's going to be question
[00:19:28 - 00:19:30] that'll be brought up to
[00:19:30 - 00:19:30] you a little bit later
[00:19:32 - 00:19:32] so hopefully i explained that
[00:19:32 - 00:19:35] well okay um and then
[00:19:35 - 00:19:35] the very same thing on
[00:19:38 - 00:19:38] the allocation of the emergency
[00:19:38 - 00:19:41] fund that 9 to verify
[00:19:41 - 00:19:44] that 9 of the interest
[00:19:44 - 00:19:44] for the from the start
[00:19:44 - 00:19:47] student scholarship fund um is
[00:19:47 - 00:19:50] put aside for emergencies no
[00:19:50 - 00:19:52] emergency funds were uh distributed
[00:19:52 - 00:19:52] at that time and again
[00:19:52 - 00:19:57] we need to know what
[00:19:57 - 00:19:57] to do with the 1
[00:19:57 - 00:19:59] 49 of that and then
[00:19:59 - 00:20:02] finally on the last one
[00:20:02 - 00:20:02] the allocation of reinvestment to
[00:20:04 - 00:20:04] the uh corpus and that
[00:20:04 - 00:20:08] was to verify that 1
[00:20:08 - 00:20:08] of the interest accured um
[00:20:08 - 00:20:11] would be kept and added
[00:20:11 - 00:20:14] to the corpus and again
[00:20:14 - 00:20:14] the oppos observation is that
[00:20:14 - 00:20:16] yes uh the first presentation
[00:20:16 - 00:20:19] of the board was uh
[00:20:19 - 00:20:19] made on september 24 and
[00:20:19 - 00:20:22] the funds were um deposited
[00:20:25 - 00:20:25] then uh the corporate funds
[00:20:25 - 00:20:27] to verify the corporate funds
[00:20:27 - 00:20:30] were not spent during the
[00:20:30 - 00:20:30] year no the 30 million
[00:20:30 - 00:20:34] uh is intact including the
[00:20:34 - 00:20:36] 1 and then allocation and
[00:20:36 - 00:20:40] determination of funds available finally
[00:20:40 - 00:20:40] to verify that 90 of
[00:20:42 - 00:20:42] the interest accured during the
[00:20:42 - 00:20:45] year ended august 24 from
[00:20:45 - 00:20:47] the student endowment fund was
[00:20:47 - 00:20:51] allocated to the scholarship um
[00:20:51 - 00:20:55] to scholarships for this programs
[00:20:55 - 00:20:55] and again down at the
[00:20:55 - 00:20:56] end u we're stating that
[00:20:56 - 00:20:58] the first scholarships awarded were
[00:20:58 - 00:21:02] in the subsequent year which
[00:21:02 - 00:21:08] is october of 2024 and
[00:21:08 - 00:21:08] again the 90 and the
[00:21:08 - 00:21:08] uh 9 and the and
[00:21:08 - 00:21:09] again the 90 and the
[00:21:09 - 00:21:10] uh 9 and the 1
[00:21:10 - 00:21:14] 1 uh are in the
[00:21:14 - 00:21:17] fund the resolution needs to
[00:21:17 - 00:21:17] determine clearly what happens what
[00:21:20 - 00:21:20] we should be doing with
[00:21:20 - 00:21:25] the funds that were originally
[00:21:25 - 00:21:27] um earned and finally approval
[00:21:27 - 00:21:27] of contracts to verify that
[00:21:28 - 00:21:30] the executive committee had prior
[00:21:30 - 00:21:32] approval from the board of
[00:21:32 - 00:21:34] trustees for uh contracts and
[00:21:34 - 00:21:36] the observation is that the
[00:21:36 - 00:21:36] executive committee did not enter
[00:21:40 - 00:21:40] into any contracts as of
[00:21:40 - 00:21:41] august 31st into any contracts
[00:21:41 - 00:21:42] as of august 31st 2024
[00:21:42 - 00:21:45] 2024 so hopefully i didn't
[00:21:45 - 00:21:46] read through that too fast
[00:21:46 - 00:21:46] but i didn't want to
[00:21:46 - 00:21:50] take too much of your
[00:21:50 - 00:21:50] time so bottom line is
[00:21:50 - 00:21:53] all the objectives were met
[00:21:53 - 00:21:56] uh the only question is
[00:21:56 - 00:21:59] clarification on the interest earned
[00:21:59 - 00:22:02] prior to the establishment of
[00:22:02 - 00:22:05] the scholarship fund and that's
[00:22:05 - 00:22:07] my story any questions ladies
[00:22:07 - 00:22:09] and gentlemen yes sir yeah
[00:22:09 - 00:22:09] i have one so we're
[00:22:09 - 00:22:14] talking about 3 1 mil
[00:22:14 - 00:22:14] in interest allocated 1 4
[00:22:17 - 00:22:17] 4 prior to establishment of
[00:22:17 - 00:22:20] the legal authority and 1
[00:22:20 - 00:22:22] 7 uh now controlled and
[00:22:22 - 00:22:26] so i'm trying to get
[00:22:26 - 00:22:26] a a concept for a
[00:22:26 - 00:22:28] couple of questions first of
[00:22:28 - 00:22:28] all dr sado or are
[00:22:33 - 00:22:33] you the 1 7 million
[00:22:33 - 00:22:35] okay is allocated to scholarships
[00:22:35 - 00:22:38] in that particular fiscal year
[00:22:38 - 00:22:38] were all of those funds
[00:22:38 - 00:22:41] allocated no sir okay so
[00:22:41 - 00:22:41] there was okay so that
[00:22:41 - 00:22:43] leads a question when they
[00:22:43 - 00:22:47] say they shall be allocated
[00:22:47 - 00:22:47] what happened what do we
[00:22:47 - 00:22:49] do we where does that
[00:22:49 - 00:22:49] if does it go back
[00:22:49 - 00:22:53] into the the uh we
[00:22:53 - 00:22:53] will maintain it in a
[00:22:53 - 00:22:57] scholarship fund for students so
[00:22:57 - 00:22:57] we maintained a scholarship fund
[00:22:57 - 00:22:59] uh independent uh it doesn't
[00:22:59 - 00:22:59] go back to the independent
[00:23:00 - 00:23:00] uh it doesn't go back
[00:23:00 - 00:23:02] to the original original doesn't
[00:23:02 - 00:23:02] go back into the corpus
[00:23:02 - 00:23:02] doesn't go back into the
[00:23:02 - 00:23:05] corpus correct correct so if
[00:23:05 - 00:23:05] we now then my suggestion
[00:23:05 - 00:23:08] is that if we did
[00:23:08 - 00:23:08] not use all that money
[00:23:08 - 00:23:10] for the scholarship and we
[00:23:10 - 00:23:10] have 1 4 four million
[00:23:13 - 00:23:13] that we need to melt
[00:23:13 - 00:23:15] we need to handle it's
[00:23:15 - 00:23:15] a one-time thing and we're
[00:23:15 - 00:23:19] going to be and my
[00:23:19 - 00:23:19] position is okay that a
[00:23:19 - 00:23:22] 1 return of uh interest
[00:23:22 - 00:23:24] back to the basic deal
[00:23:24 - 00:23:27] is probably insufficient compared to
[00:23:27 - 00:23:27] a two to five two
[00:23:27 - 00:23:30] to three two to four
[00:23:30 - 00:23:30] whatever your particular deal is
[00:23:32 - 00:23:32] is that this is a
[00:23:32 - 00:23:34] one-time shot we have the
[00:23:34 - 00:23:34] we have the procedure we
[00:23:34 - 00:23:36] have the policy to move
[00:23:36 - 00:23:36] it forward from here on
[00:23:38 - 00:23:38] after that will allocate the
[00:23:38 - 00:23:41] funds of that particular year
[00:23:41 - 00:23:43] to scholarships and we didn't
[00:23:43 - 00:23:43] do we didn't allocate all
[00:23:43 - 00:23:44] the funds to the scholarships
[00:23:44 - 00:23:47] so there's money left over
[00:23:47 - 00:23:47] so if we do the
[00:23:47 - 00:23:48] keep 1 4 we're going
[00:23:48 - 00:23:48] to have a lot more
[00:23:48 - 00:23:51] left over let's so let's
[00:23:51 - 00:23:51] let's tuck the 1 4
[00:23:54 - 00:23:54] back into the original and
[00:23:54 - 00:23:57] uh and just have the
[00:23:57 - 00:24:00] scholarship fund benefit from that
[00:24:00 - 00:24:02] one a one-time advantage i
[00:24:02 - 00:24:02] i think that's a board
[00:24:02 - 00:24:04] decision mr xer um i
[00:24:04 - 00:24:08] certainly understand and respect the
[00:24:08 - 00:24:10] the proposition um a couple
[00:24:10 - 00:24:10] of things so we received
[00:24:10 - 00:24:13] the resources in 2021 and
[00:24:13 - 00:24:15] it began to earn interest
[00:24:15 - 00:24:15] thanks to our staff who
[00:24:15 - 00:24:18] put it away wisely it
[00:24:18 - 00:24:20] began to earn interest the
[00:24:20 - 00:24:20] board then contemplated how to
[00:24:22 - 00:24:22] utilize these resources with legal
[00:24:25 - 00:24:25] counsel's assistance we were able
[00:24:25 - 00:24:27] to come up to resolution
[00:24:27 - 00:24:31] of how to utilize the
[00:24:31 - 00:24:34] the resources in 2024 so
[00:24:34 - 00:24:34] the initial amount of interest
[00:24:34 - 00:24:35] was much larger than we
[00:24:35 - 00:24:38] would have anticipated providing in
[00:24:38 - 00:24:41] any given year of scholarships
[00:24:41 - 00:24:41] so i'm by no means
[00:24:41 - 00:24:44] am i opposed it's really
[00:24:44 - 00:24:47] a board decision on what
[00:24:47 - 00:24:47] to do with the 1
[00:24:47 - 00:24:49] 475 um that is um
[00:24:49 - 00:24:53] additional revenue that was collected
[00:24:53 - 00:24:53] um before that period of
[00:24:54 - 00:24:54] time where the board established
[00:24:54 - 00:24:57] the student success endowment so
[00:24:57 - 00:25:00] i would caution the board
[00:25:00 - 00:25:00] not to say that we
[00:25:03 - 00:25:03] will use all of the
[00:25:03 - 00:25:04] resources because there may be
[00:25:04 - 00:25:04] years where we're not able
[00:25:07 - 00:25:07] to award enough scholarships or
[00:25:07 - 00:25:09] the students don't meet the
[00:25:09 - 00:25:10] requirements that have been established
[00:25:10 - 00:25:13] based on the on the
[00:25:13 - 00:25:13] scholarships and that we could
[00:25:14 - 00:25:14] keep those resources because remember
[00:25:16 - 00:25:16] it's a fall and spring
[00:25:16 - 00:25:19] as well as the following
[00:25:19 - 00:25:19] fall and spring that the
[00:25:19 - 00:25:22] board has committed to for
[00:25:22 - 00:25:24] those students so you're everything
[00:25:24 - 00:25:26] that you said is logical
[00:25:26 - 00:25:26] and and that would be
[00:25:26 - 00:25:26] a a board logical and
[00:25:27 - 00:25:28] and that would be a
[00:25:29 - 00:25:31] a board decision respectfully i
[00:25:31 - 00:25:33] disagree with that sir i
[00:25:33 - 00:25:33] think that that should be
[00:25:33 - 00:25:38] an administrative decision because as
[00:25:38 - 00:25:38] a board member i don't
[00:25:38 - 00:25:41] want to have that control
[00:25:41 - 00:25:41] that you know that we
[00:25:41 - 00:25:42] tie the hands of the
[00:25:42 - 00:25:45] people that are actually seeing
[00:25:45 - 00:25:45] the need up front of
[00:25:45 - 00:25:48] the students so i would
[00:25:48 - 00:25:52] just i think that we
[00:25:52 - 00:25:52] already articulated the the plan
[00:25:55 - 00:25:55] clearly rented by legal several
[00:25:55 - 00:25:59] times and discussed it and
[00:25:59 - 00:26:01] agreed upon it and that
[00:26:01 - 00:26:01] is a piece that needs
[00:26:01 - 00:26:04] to be discussed by the
[00:26:04 - 00:26:06] administrative team or the executive
[00:26:06 - 00:26:06] team and and made a
[00:26:08 - 00:26:12] decision on that well if
[00:26:12 - 00:26:12] if i may again the
[00:26:12 - 00:26:15] question is because it stated
[00:26:15 - 00:26:18] that the interest earned from
[00:26:18 - 00:26:22] the fund the so the
[00:26:22 - 00:26:24] 14 million the question is
[00:26:24 - 00:26:27] whether that should be put
[00:26:27 - 00:26:27] into the corpus and we
[00:26:27 - 00:26:31] should have 31 4 4
[00:26:31 - 00:26:31] million that we never spent
[00:26:31 - 00:26:36] or can we can we
[00:26:36 - 00:26:36] say that the original 30
[00:26:36 - 00:26:39] million is the corpus and
[00:26:39 - 00:26:41] every penny earned since that
[00:26:41 - 00:26:43] point goes into the scholarship
[00:26:43 - 00:26:46] fund for scholarships i i
[00:26:46 - 00:26:46] have a question i think
[00:26:46 - 00:26:49] it's a 30 million but
[00:26:49 - 00:26:49] don't we then take each
[00:26:49 - 00:26:51] one year the scholarship fund
[00:26:51 - 00:26:51] increases by year the scholarship
[00:26:51 - 00:26:51] fund increases by 1 1
[00:26:54 - 00:26:54] correct and so in other
[00:26:54 - 00:26:57] words so it's not 30
[00:26:57 - 00:26:57] million this it's 30 1
[00:26:59 - 00:26:59] fund of that and all
[00:26:59 - 00:27:01] i'm saying is is that
[00:27:01 - 00:27:01] it's a one-time deal we
[00:27:02 - 00:27:04] haven't used it there the
[00:27:04 - 00:27:06] policies yeah and and so
[00:27:06 - 00:27:06] we have a question do
[00:27:06 - 00:27:09] we want to say we
[00:27:09 - 00:27:09] want to have a bigger
[00:27:09 - 00:27:11] uh petty cash i mean
[00:27:11 - 00:27:11] i know that 3 million
[00:27:11 - 00:27:15] 2 million but but have
[00:27:15 - 00:27:15] we used for lack of
[00:27:17 - 00:27:17] a better term have a
[00:27:17 - 00:27:19] a petty cashache there okay
[00:27:19 - 00:27:19] or if we put it
[00:27:19 - 00:27:21] back in the scholarship fund
[00:27:21 - 00:27:25] and that in itself becomes
[00:27:25 - 00:27:25] a basis for more interest
[00:27:25 - 00:27:28] to be earned in the
[00:27:28 - 00:27:30] future right and again since
[00:27:30 - 00:27:32] it was all established by
[00:27:32 - 00:27:32] the board this is a
[00:27:35 - 00:27:35] clarification that we're asking the
[00:27:35 - 00:27:37] clarification that we're asking the
[00:27:38 - 00:27:40] board and dr sarata hagerty
[00:27:40 - 00:27:43] if you want to we
[00:27:43 - 00:27:43] could jump into section 1
[00:27:43 - 00:27:46] 9 7 if the board
[00:27:46 - 00:27:46] wants to have that discussion
[00:27:46 - 00:27:47] now board wants to have
[00:27:47 - 00:27:48] that discussion now uh uh
[00:27:51 - 00:27:51] i mean as long as
[00:27:51 - 00:27:53] my my personal opinion is
[00:27:53 - 00:27:53] the one the money that
[00:27:53 - 00:27:55] was made before we set
[00:27:55 - 00:27:55] up the fund is put
[00:27:55 - 00:27:57] it back in the fund
[00:27:57 - 00:27:57] and give it out in
[00:28:00 - 00:28:00] scholarships because i i think
[00:28:00 - 00:28:02] what the board's idea was
[00:28:02 - 00:28:02] we'd always have 30 board's
[00:28:02 - 00:28:03] idea was we'd always have
[00:28:03 - 00:28:06] 30 million million as our
[00:28:06 - 00:28:09] as a corpus is our
[00:28:09 - 00:28:09] corpus so that so if
[00:28:09 - 00:28:11] we made interest before we
[00:28:11 - 00:28:13] got around because we had
[00:28:13 - 00:28:13] a big discussion on how
[00:28:13 - 00:28:14] we were going to do
[00:28:14 - 00:28:16] with this money for several
[00:28:16 - 00:28:19] days and we finally decided
[00:28:19 - 00:28:22] so just put that other
[00:28:22 - 00:28:22] money that was earned prior
[00:28:22 - 00:28:24] to put it in the
[00:28:24 - 00:28:24] fund and give it out
[00:28:24 - 00:28:26] in scholarship yeah i exactly
[00:28:26 - 00:28:29] that's why i think the
[00:28:29 - 00:28:30] original intent was 30 million
[00:28:30 - 00:28:30] is going to be the
[00:28:30 - 00:28:32] corpus anything it earns goes
[00:28:32 - 00:28:34] into the scholarship but we
[00:28:34 - 00:28:34] need the scholarship but we
[00:28:34 - 00:28:37] need the clarification clarification well
[00:28:37 - 00:28:39] scholarships plus the 1 yes
[00:28:39 - 00:28:41] yes yes yes so we
[00:28:41 - 00:28:45] the administration has broken down
[00:28:45 - 00:28:45] the data for the board
[00:28:45 - 00:28:51] um and the if we
[00:28:51 - 00:28:51] went with the original intent
[00:28:51 - 00:29:00] of would go into the
[00:29:00 - 00:29:03] scholarship fund which we would
[00:29:03 - 00:29:04] allocate as um as quickly
[00:29:05 - 00:29:05] as we can as long
[00:29:05 - 00:29:09] as students meet the requirements
[00:29:09 - 00:29:11] etc 132 773 additional dollars
[00:29:11 - 00:29:13] would go into the emergency
[00:29:13 - 00:29:14] fund and then an additional
[00:29:14 - 00:29:15] emergency fund and then an
[00:29:15 - 00:29:16] additional 14 753 14 753
[00:29:20 - 00:29:20] would go back into the
[00:29:20 - 00:29:22] fund um to try and
[00:29:22 - 00:29:22] maintain its its buying power
[00:29:22 - 00:29:23] so to and maintain its
[00:29:23 - 00:29:24] its buying power so to
[00:29:24 - 00:29:27] speak speak but again this
[00:29:27 - 00:29:27] is a board decision i
[00:29:31 - 00:29:31] um i i want to
[00:29:31 - 00:29:31] make sure that um that
[00:29:33 - 00:29:35] the board's direction doesn't violate
[00:29:35 - 00:29:37] what we've actually established and
[00:29:37 - 00:29:38] i'd ask legal actually established
[00:29:38 - 00:29:38] and i'd ask legal counsel
[00:29:38 - 00:29:40] counsel i have a question
[00:29:40 - 00:29:40] out over there if we
[00:29:44 - 00:29:44] had one and we earned
[00:29:44 - 00:29:46] 1 7 million okay that
[00:29:46 - 00:29:46] was available to be awarded
[00:29:46 - 00:29:49] to scholarships and we didn't
[00:29:49 - 00:29:51] award it what's to say
[00:29:51 - 00:29:51] that we're going to be
[00:29:52 - 00:29:52] needing above and beyond that
[00:29:52 - 00:29:55] we're going to plan for
[00:29:55 - 00:29:57] future catastrophe uh it seems
[00:29:57 - 00:29:57] to me that the bigger
[00:29:57 - 00:30:00] the pad we have the
[00:30:00 - 00:30:03] insurance and gives us there
[00:30:03 - 00:30:03] i realize the idea that
[00:30:03 - 00:30:04] we want to do it
[00:30:04 - 00:30:04] but we didn't give it
[00:30:04 - 00:30:07] all out before correct we
[00:30:07 - 00:30:07] didn't give it out now
[00:30:07 - 00:30:09] so why do we think
[00:30:09 - 00:30:09] we want to save it
[00:30:09 - 00:30:10] so we can give it
[00:30:10 - 00:30:13] out some other time i
[00:30:13 - 00:30:13] think that's fair i my
[00:30:13 - 00:30:16] my only caution is that
[00:30:16 - 00:30:16] it not violate what the
[00:30:18 - 00:30:21] board actually established i think
[00:30:21 - 00:30:21] the question here is is
[00:30:21 - 00:30:24] do we want to keep
[00:30:24 - 00:30:24] it at 30 million or
[00:30:24 - 00:30:26] do we want to add
[00:30:26 - 00:30:26] that to and make it
[00:30:26 - 00:30:29] 31 like you said that's
[00:30:29 - 00:30:33] our only decision my decision
[00:30:33 - 00:30:33] is our number one issue
[00:30:33 - 00:30:36] was to make sure we
[00:30:36 - 00:30:36] always had the 30 million
[00:30:39 - 00:30:39] so i said we do
[00:30:39 - 00:30:39] what dr sarat is saying
[00:30:41 - 00:30:41] is we put the 1
[00:30:41 - 00:30:43] is we put the 1
[00:30:44 - 00:30:46] four four back into the
[00:30:46 - 00:30:46] scholarship fun and if we
[00:30:48 - 00:30:48] don't give it out then
[00:30:48 - 00:30:50] it rolls over to the
[00:30:50 - 00:30:52] next year as long as
[00:30:52 - 00:30:52] we keep the balance at
[00:30:52 - 00:30:56] 30 million bucks 30 million
[00:30:56 - 00:30:58] plus 1 or whatever 30
[00:30:58 - 00:31:02] million plus that's out of
[00:31:02 - 00:31:02] the 10 we said we're
[00:31:02 - 00:31:04] taking out so that's my
[00:31:04 - 00:31:04] i'm going to make a
[00:31:04 - 00:31:06] motion that we do that
[00:31:09 - 00:31:09] we do what dr sat
[00:31:09 - 00:31:10] is suggesting with those figures
[00:31:13 - 00:31:15] item 1 9 7 discussion
[00:31:15 - 00:31:15] and take possible action to
[00:31:16 - 00:31:16] consider whether interest earned between
[00:31:21 - 00:31:21] may 2021 to august 31
[00:31:21 - 00:31:22] 2023 should be added to
[00:31:22 - 00:31:22] the corpus or made available
[00:31:24 - 00:31:26] for student scholarships my motion
[00:31:26 - 00:31:26] is to give it to
[00:31:26 - 00:31:26] student my motion is to
[00:31:26 - 00:31:27] give it to student scholarships

[00:39:54 - 00:40:00] by sharing some examples the
[00:40:00 - 00:40:00] first is epcc cares a
[00:40:00 - 00:40:01] mental health focused initiative led
[00:40:01 - 00:40:04] by our counselors initiatives like
[00:40:04 - 00:40:06] this are essential as they
[00:40:06 - 00:40:08] provide students with resources that
[00:40:08 - 00:40:10] improve their overall college experience
[00:40:12 - 00:40:12] i was among the first
[00:40:12 - 00:40:15] students enrolled in epcc cares
[00:40:15 - 00:40:15] when it launched and i
[00:40:16 - 00:40:17] can confidently say that it
[00:40:17 - 00:40:19] was a gamecher for me

[00:40:30 - 00:40:32] a perfect example of valuating
[00:40:32 - 00:40:34] student perspectives in important discussions
[00:40:36 - 00:40:36] this will be an excellent
[00:40:36 - 00:40:38] opportunity for collaboration and progress
[00:40:40 - 00:40:40] furthermore over the past year
[00:40:40 - 00:40:41] we've been collaborating with the
[00:40:41 - 00:40:43] progress pillar team where we
[00:40:43 - 00:40:45] reach out to students to
[00:40:45 - 00:40:45] gather their feedback on how

[00:52:17 - 00:52:19] funding model approved during the
[00:52:19 - 00:52:22] 88th legislature as a community
[00:52:22 - 00:52:22] college finance bill in this

[00:52:27 - 00:52:31] methods were refined the preliminary
[00:52:31 - 00:52:33] fisc year 2526 operating budget
[00:52:33 - 00:52:33] was also presented to include
[00:52:36 - 00:52:39] revenue projections additional funding needs
[00:52:39 - 00:52:42] and different funding strategies to
[00:52:42 - 00:52:47] fund the operating budget so
[00:52:47 - 00:52:47] we will also cover the
[00:52:47 - 00:52:51] 2526 revenue projections in the
[00:52:51 - 00:52:54] next few slides and we're
[00:52:54 - 00:52:54] going to talk about the
[00:52:54 - 00:52:57] 2526 baseline budget which essentially
[00:52:57 - 00:53:00] is the expenditure side of
[00:53:00 - 00:53:03] the operating budget based upon
[00:53:03 - 00:53:07] executive level submissions of budgets
[00:53:07 - 00:53:07] in the march uh 2025
[00:53:07 - 00:53:11] time frame then we will
[00:53:11 - 00:53:14] present the 2526 proposed budget
[00:53:14 - 00:53:14] for your approval this proposed
[00:53:14 - 00:53:17] budget for your approval this
[00:53:17 - 00:53:19] evening so this is a
[00:53:19 - 00:53:22] look at the revenue projections
[00:53:22 - 00:53:25] for 2526 and this amount
[00:53:25 - 00:53:25] at the very bottom of
[00:53:33 - 00:53:33] will be the amount presented
[00:53:33 - 00:53:35] for the operating budget because
[00:53:35 - 00:53:37] we cannot exceed revenue projections
[00:53:37 - 00:53:40] so state appropriations came in
[00:53:40 - 00:53:42] on the revenue projections with
[00:53:42 - 00:53:47] a positive variance of 5
[00:53:47 - 00:53:47] 6 6 million or 12
[00:53:47 - 00:53:52] 77 higher than the adopted
[00:53:52 - 00:53:56] budget for 2425 tuition and
[00:53:56 - 00:53:56] fees are estimated at 38
[00:53:56 - 00:54:00] 9 million a small decrease
[00:54:00 - 00:54:01] of 214 000 at the
[00:54:01 - 00:54:01] last presentation on august the
[00:54:04 - 00:54:04] 6th i said that we
[00:54:04 - 00:54:04] would keep an eye on
[00:54:06 - 00:54:06] fall enrollment and adjust the
[00:54:06 - 00:54:09] figures if necessary um i
[00:54:09 - 00:54:12] would tell you that as
[00:54:12 - 00:54:12] of yesterday our enrollment was
[00:54:12 - 00:54:15] 2 higher um during the
[00:54:15 - 00:54:18] time of the august 6
[00:54:18 - 00:54:18] presentation we were down i
[00:54:18 - 00:54:21] think 24 students were up
[00:54:21 - 00:54:23] like 456 i think yesterday
[00:54:23 - 00:54:24] so it has slowly been
[00:54:26 - 00:54:26] trending in the right direction
[00:54:26 - 00:54:28] and there is still uh
[00:54:28 - 00:54:32] late registration occurring this week
[00:54:36 - 00:54:36] so property taxes now are
[00:54:36 - 00:54:39] estimated 75 2 2 million
[00:54:39 - 00:54:39] and as the title on
[00:54:39 - 00:54:40] this slide says based upon
[00:54:40 - 00:54:43] certified property valuations that we
[00:54:43 - 00:54:43] got from the cad on
[00:54:47 - 00:54:47] july the 25th of this
[00:54:47 - 00:54:49] year that is the projection
[00:54:49 - 00:54:49] for property tax revenue for
[00:54:51 - 00:54:51] next year as a property
[00:54:51 - 00:54:55] it has a positive variance
[00:54:55 - 00:54:55] of 2 1 million around
[00:54:58 - 00:54:58] 3 higher than the adopted
[00:54:58 - 00:54:59] budget 3 higher than the
[00:54:59 - 00:55:04] adopted budget revenue revenue for
[00:55:04 - 00:55:04] the prior year so other
[00:55:04 - 00:55:07] income is estimated at 6
[00:55:07 - 00:55:08] 2 million as a reminder
[00:55:09 - 00:55:09] we budget interest income very
[00:55:12 - 00:55:12] conservatively because it is not
[00:55:12 - 00:55:14] a good revenue source uh
[00:55:14 - 00:55:17] because it is sometimes unpredictable
[00:55:19 - 00:55:19] based upon economic conditions and
[00:55:22 - 00:55:22] changes that occur quickly in
[00:55:22 - 00:55:27] the news and other places
[00:55:27 - 00:55:29] so uh following uh next
[00:55:29 - 00:55:32] is the self-supporting revenues projected
[00:55:32 - 00:55:34] at 3 million the total
[00:55:34 - 00:55:34] for that column as i
[00:55:34 - 00:55:43] said a positive variance of
[00:55:43 - 00:55:47] 7 4 million over the
[00:55:47 - 00:55:47] prior year adopted budget overall
[00:55:49 - 00:55:49] about a 4 5 about
[00:55:49 - 00:55:51] a 4 5 increase increase
[00:55:53 - 00:55:53] next we see these revenues
[00:55:53 - 00:55:57] the same amount 173 9
[00:55:57 - 00:55:59] million represented as a percentage
[00:55:59 - 00:55:59] of the total revenues and
[00:56:02 - 00:56:02] here property tax tax tax
[00:56:02 - 00:56:06] revenue is still the highest
[00:56:06 - 00:56:09] at 43 27 of the
[00:56:09 - 00:56:11] total revenues state appropriations coming
[00:56:11 - 00:56:12] in second at appropriations coming
[00:56:12 - 00:56:14] in second at 28 62
[00:56:14 - 00:56:18] 28 62 followed by tuition
[00:56:18 - 00:56:21] and fees 22 38 other
[00:56:21 - 00:56:25] income 3 6 self-supporting and
[00:56:25 - 00:56:27] o overhead recovery smaller amounts
[00:56:27 - 00:56:34] making up the total next
[00:56:34 - 00:56:34] we have the baseline budgets
[00:56:34 - 00:56:37] which uh determine the operating
[00:56:37 - 00:56:39] expenditure budget now the baseline
[00:56:39 - 00:56:41] budget is based upon submissions
[00:56:41 - 00:56:43] by the various executive levels
[00:56:43 - 00:56:47] which occurred back in march
[00:56:47 - 00:56:47] of this year and this
[00:56:47 - 00:56:50] is all the the baseline
[00:56:50 - 00:56:53] budgets that were submitted without
[00:56:53 - 00:56:53] considering any extra request or
[00:56:56 - 00:56:56] additional funding requests so when
[00:56:56 - 00:56:59] we look at the baseline
[00:56:59 - 00:57:03] budget uh instruction is the
[00:57:03 - 00:57:07] highest at 33 11 or
[00:57:07 - 00:57:07] 54 7 million followed by
[00:57:10 - 00:57:10] institutional support 49 million 49
[00:57:10 - 00:57:14] 7 million or 30 of
[00:57:14 - 00:57:17] the baseline budget followed by
[00:57:17 - 00:57:20] academic support 20 3 million
[00:57:20 - 00:57:22] or 12 28 of the
[00:57:22 - 00:57:25] budget interestingly when you combine
[00:57:25 - 00:57:27] instruction and academic support you
[00:57:27 - 00:57:27] get about 45 of the
[00:57:28 - 00:57:30] budget in direct support of
[00:57:30 - 00:57:33] students so i would make
[00:57:33 - 00:57:35] that clarification for you uh
[00:57:35 - 00:57:40] operation and maintenance of physical
[00:57:40 - 00:57:40] plant 13 2 million or
[00:57:40 - 00:57:42] 8 followed by student services
[00:57:42 - 00:57:46] which also goes to helping
[00:57:46 - 00:57:52] students uh 12 7 million
[00:57:52 - 00:57:52] or 7 68 68 transfers
[00:57:52 - 00:57:55] 7 5 uh million dollar
[00:57:55 - 00:57:55] or 4 6 followed by
[00:57:58 - 00:57:58] public service 3 8 million
[00:58:02 - 00:58:02] self-supporting programs are budgeted at
[00:58:11 - 00:58:11] so this is the baseline
[00:58:11 - 00:58:14] budget that is going to
[00:58:14 - 00:58:17] support the uh recommended operating
[00:58:17 - 00:58:17] budget which you will see
[00:58:17 - 00:58:20] in the next few slides
[00:58:25 - 00:58:25] this next slide combines both
[00:58:25 - 00:58:29] the uh baseline budget and
[00:58:29 - 00:58:34] then the additional funding needs
[00:58:34 - 00:58:34] so we just saw on
[00:58:34 - 00:58:35] on the funding needs so
[00:58:35 - 00:58:36] we just saw on on
[00:58:36 - 00:58:40] the previous previous slide the
[00:58:40 - 00:58:40] baseline budget of 165 4
[00:58:45 - 00:58:45] million now you see it
[00:58:45 - 00:58:47] again here um on this
[00:58:47 - 00:58:47] slide and all the functional
[00:58:47 - 00:58:50] areas that comprise that amount
[00:58:50 - 00:58:52] and then followed by additional
[00:58:52 - 00:58:53] funding requests we had critical
[00:58:53 - 00:58:56] needs that were presented to
[00:58:56 - 00:58:56] the board previously 1 7
[00:58:56 - 00:58:57] presented to the board previously
[00:58:57 - 00:59:01] 1 7 million million and
[00:59:01 - 00:59:01] then an item to adjust
[00:59:01 - 00:59:04] our salary tables by 6
[00:59:06 - 00:59:09] the entry tables the entry
[00:59:09 - 00:59:10] levels in the tables uh
[00:59:12 - 00:59:15] valued at 672 000 and
[00:59:15 - 00:59:15] then the 3 salary increase
[00:59:15 - 00:59:17] that was approved at the
[00:59:17 - 00:59:18] august 6th board approved at
[00:59:18 - 00:59:19] the august 6th board meeting
[00:59:19 - 00:59:21] meeting followed by additional requests
[00:59:21 - 00:59:26] from the executive levels of
[00:59:26 - 00:59:30] 1 9 million and uh
[00:59:30 - 00:59:30] bianium reserve this will go
[00:59:30 - 00:59:33] to mitigate any any revenue
[00:59:33 - 00:59:37] estimates that we may not
[00:59:37 - 00:59:38] have uh estimated properly uh
[00:59:38 - 00:59:38] for example if the state
[00:59:40 - 00:59:40] appropriation comes in lower than
[00:59:40 - 00:59:43] what we projected this would
[00:59:43 - 00:59:45] be where we might balance
[00:59:45 - 00:59:45] that difference if it was
[00:59:51 - 00:59:51] lower so all told this
[00:59:51 - 00:59:56] is the budget uh proposed
[00:59:56 - 00:59:56] budget for fiscal year 2526
[00:59:59 - 00:59:59] um we believe that all
[00:59:59 - 01:00:02] the revenue estimates are conservative
[01:00:02 - 01:00:04] and cons have considered certain
[01:00:04 - 01:00:07] risks that we are subject
[01:00:07 - 01:00:10] to like state appropriations having
[01:00:10 - 01:00:10] a bianium reserve and we
[01:00:10 - 01:00:12] believe that this is a
[01:00:12 - 01:00:13] sustainable budget going that this
[01:00:13 - 01:00:15] is a sustainable budget going
[01:00:15 - 01:00:25] forward it has been a
[01:00:25 - 01:00:26] long process starting in february

[01:17:51 - 01:17:54] year 2025 2026 in an
[01:17:54 - 01:17:54] amount not to exceed 200
[01:17:54 - 01:17:58] 000 200 000 annual aggregate
[01:17:58 - 01:17:59] item 4 5 discussion and
[01:17:59 - 01:17:59] action on the approval to
[01:18:02 - 01:18:02] award a contract to clear
[01:18:02 - 01:18:04] channel outdoor for outdoor advertising
[01:18:04 - 01:18:07] for fiscal year 2025 2026
[01:18:07 - 01:18:09] in an amount not to
[01:18:09 - 01:18:10] exceed 150 000 annual aggregate
[01:18:13 - 01:18:13] any questions on 4 3
[01:18:13 - 01:18:16] uh i have a question
[01:18:16 - 01:18:17] on 4 3 go ahead
[01:18:19 - 01:18:19] actually in the whole thing
[01:18:19 - 01:18:21] if you look at 4
[01:18:21 - 01:18:21] 2 three four and five
[01:18:21 - 01:18:24] all fall under the larger
[01:18:24 - 01:18:26] category of media uh if
[01:18:26 - 01:18:26] you total them they come
[01:18:26 - 01:18:30] to just a tad short
[01:18:30 - 01:18:30] of 1 million okay so
[01:18:30 - 01:18:32] i have a couple questions
[01:18:32 - 01:18:36] first of all these are
[01:18:36 - 01:18:39] broken up by topics and
[01:18:39 - 01:18:39] i think if i remember
[01:18:39 - 01:18:42] correctly these these requested amounts
[01:18:42 - 01:18:45] are similar or comparable to
[01:18:45 - 01:18:47] a pre uh a request
[01:18:47 - 01:18:47] at this time last year
[01:18:47 - 01:18:49] about the same amount is
[01:18:49 - 01:18:50] that correct that is correct
[01:18:54 - 01:18:54] okay now if we had
[01:18:54 - 01:18:56] a million dollars how much
[01:18:56 - 01:18:56] of that did we spend
[01:18:56 - 01:18:58] last year did we spend
[01:18:58 - 01:18:58] that all of that money
[01:18:58 - 01:18:59] last did we spend that
[01:18:59 - 01:18:59] all of that money last
[01:18:59 - 01:19:03] year year uh we spend
[01:19:03 - 01:19:03] less than 500 000 on
[01:19:03 - 01:19:05] um advertising but this gives
[01:19:05 - 01:19:08] us the flexibility based on
[01:19:08 - 01:19:09] research to adjust where we're
[01:19:09 - 01:19:15] spending the money okay so
[01:19:15 - 01:19:15] you're asking for 950 000
[01:19:17 - 01:19:17] aggregate in all four would
[01:19:18 - 01:19:20] you anticipate that you would
[01:19:20 - 01:19:22] need all 950 or if
[01:19:22 - 01:19:25] not why no last year
[01:19:25 - 01:19:26] we only spent 460 000
[01:19:27 - 01:19:29] and this year um the
[01:19:29 - 01:19:29] same amount is in the
[01:19:29 - 01:19:33] budget and so and the
[01:19:33 - 01:19:35] reason for that is so
[01:19:35 - 01:19:35] this way we have flexibility
[01:19:35 - 01:19:37] when we're looking at our
[01:19:37 - 01:19:40] return on investment and we
[01:19:40 - 01:19:40] see the data on how
[01:19:42 - 01:19:42] the advertising is producing we
[01:19:42 - 01:19:45] can adjust for example if
[01:19:45 - 01:19:47] we see we need to
[01:19:47 - 01:19:47] spend a little bit more
[01:19:47 - 01:19:49] in television or we need
[01:19:49 - 01:19:49] to spend a little bit
[01:19:49 - 01:19:52] more in radio to reach
[01:19:52 - 01:19:54] a particular demographic it gives
[01:19:54 - 01:19:54] us the flexibility to make
[01:19:55 - 01:19:58] those adjustments okay and last
[01:19:58 - 01:20:01] question in looking at that
[01:20:01 - 01:20:05] how do we determine do
[01:20:05 - 01:20:05] do you have a survey
[01:20:05 - 01:20:05] or is it uh uh
[01:20:07 - 01:20:07] general questions or it's observation
[01:20:09 - 01:20:09] what would lead you to
[01:20:09 - 01:20:13] make you know like an
[01:20:13 - 01:20:13] on uh real time decision
[01:20:13 - 01:20:16] over the year as to
[01:20:16 - 01:20:16] where to go where to
[01:20:17 - 01:20:19] emphasize your median that's a
[01:20:19 - 01:20:22] great question we're always monitoring
[01:20:22 - 01:20:22] um whether it's anecdotal or
[01:20:24 - 01:20:27] whether through measurement for example
[01:20:27 - 01:20:29] on our digital advertising we're
[01:20:29 - 01:20:31] able to measure click-through rates
[01:20:31 - 01:20:31] um that would be one
[01:20:31 - 01:20:35] example other times um we
[01:20:35 - 01:20:38] look at enrollment um and
[01:20:38 - 01:20:38] determine where the dollars are
[01:20:42 - 01:20:42] making an impact and adjust
[01:20:42 - 01:20:45] accordingly and dr sat out
[01:20:45 - 01:20:45] of all this if i'm
[01:20:45 - 01:20:47] not mistaken i think this
[01:20:47 - 01:20:47] is one of the few
[01:20:49 - 01:20:49] times that we actually have
[01:20:49 - 01:20:52] one person really is sort
[01:20:52 - 01:20:52] of working with a budget
[01:20:54 - 01:20:54] of a million dollars and
[01:20:54 - 01:20:58] i think i think she's
[01:20:58 - 01:20:58] done that area has done
[01:20:58 - 01:21:01] an exceptional job exceptional job
[01:21:01 - 01:21:05] in being able to identify
[01:21:05 - 01:21:08] segregate qualify and and follow
[01:21:08 - 01:21:08] up and respond in real
[01:21:08 - 01:21:11] time as to what needs
[01:21:11 - 01:21:11] to be done and appears
[01:21:13 - 01:21:16] to be don't go to
[01:21:16 - 01:21:16] your head but appears to
[01:21:16 - 01:21:18] be a good steward of
[01:21:18 - 01:21:20] the money mr xer i
[01:21:20 - 01:21:22] certainly appreciate that and i
[01:21:22 - 01:21:22] certainly concur that dr mo
[01:21:22 - 01:21:25] and her team have done
[01:21:25 - 01:21:25] a tremendous job um we
[01:21:27 - 01:21:27] saw spring enrollment up approximately
[01:21:31 - 01:21:31] 5 summer enrollment was up
[01:21:31 - 01:21:34] 11 um we were we
[01:21:34 - 01:21:34] are currently surprised that um
[01:21:36 - 01:21:36] fall enrollment is relatively flat
[01:21:38 - 01:21:38] we're up a couple percent
[01:21:38 - 01:21:40] today and we have uh
[01:21:40 - 01:21:42] we're continuing the enrollment process
[01:21:42 - 01:21:42] and we'll continue it through
[01:21:44 - 01:21:44] many meers but i agree
[01:21:44 - 01:21:46] dr dr mo and her
[01:21:46 - 01:21:46] team have done a great
[01:21:46 - 01:21:49] job of disagregating the data
[01:21:49 - 01:21:51] um and utilizing the different
[01:21:51 - 01:21:53] modes of communication with students
[01:21:53 - 01:21:56] they have shifted over time
[01:21:56 - 01:21:56] we used to do a
[01:21:56 - 01:21:58] lot more television uh and
[01:21:58 - 01:22:01] they have shifted over time
[01:22:01 - 01:22:01] to do a lot more
[01:22:01 - 01:22:05] social media um and i
[01:22:05 - 01:22:05] agree and concur with your
[01:22:06 - 01:22:11] um congratulator congratulatory statements towards
[01:22:11 - 01:22:16] you any other questions thank

[01:24:30 - 01:24:30] uh questions on 4 7

[01:24:33 - 01:24:34] 4 8 8 4 9
[01:24:34 - 01:24:37] yes yes when we look
[01:24:37 - 01:24:37] at 4 9 we with
[01:24:37 - 01:24:40] the budget and so i
[01:24:40 - 01:24:40] i referred back to page
[01:24:40 - 01:24:43] 113 which talks about that
[01:24:43 - 01:24:45] and then actually what happened
[01:24:45 - 01:24:45] is that it refers then
[01:24:45 - 01:24:47] to a table on 4
[01:24:47 - 01:24:47] 4 four and we have
[01:24:47 - 01:24:50] the auxiliary budget for fiscal
[01:24:50 - 01:24:52] year and if i look
[01:24:52 - 01:24:52] at that there's two columns
[01:24:52 - 01:24:56] it says budget 83125 and
[01:24:56 - 01:24:59] it has ending fund balance
[01:24:59 - 01:25:02] of 5 538234 and then
[01:25:02 - 01:25:02] it says budget beginning the
[01:25:05 - 01:25:05] next year at 5 824
[01:25:05 - 01:25:09] so there's a delta of
[01:25:09 - 01:25:12] almost 300 000 gain do
[01:25:12 - 01:25:12] we not have if we
[01:25:12 - 01:25:16] say end of year budget
[01:25:16 - 01:25:16] and a start of year
[01:25:16 - 01:25:18] budget those is does there
[01:25:18 - 01:25:20] something occur in between there
[01:25:20 - 01:25:20] that you're not tracking how
[01:25:20 - 01:25:22] come that we have 300
[01:25:22 - 01:25:24] 000 difference that that's a
[01:25:24 - 01:25:28] very good observation uh mr
[01:25:28 - 01:25:28] oxer that is a budgeted
[01:25:28 - 01:25:32] projection for ending fund balance
[01:25:32 - 01:25:35] and not the one based
[01:25:35 - 01:25:37] upon actual numbers so it
[01:25:37 - 01:25:37] is a budgeted the budget
[01:25:37 - 01:25:40] is a projection so this
[01:25:40 - 01:25:43] is what we budgeted for
[01:25:43 - 01:25:43] the end of this year
[01:25:43 - 01:25:45] as the fund balance but
[01:25:45 - 01:25:45] in reality it's going to
[01:25:48 - 01:25:48] come in higher because revenues
[01:25:48 - 01:25:50] came in higher to the
[01:25:50 - 01:25:53] auxiliary fund therefore we start
[01:25:53 - 01:25:53] with uh what we believe
[01:25:54 - 01:25:55] is going to be the
[01:25:55 - 01:25:58] beginning balance which is higher
[01:25:58 - 01:25:58] because we had higher revenues
[01:26:00 - 01:26:03] than expected okay so we
[01:26:03 - 01:26:03] think we think the bottom
[01:26:05 - 01:26:05] line is one thing but
[01:26:05 - 01:26:06] then if we sit back
[01:26:06 - 01:26:06] and think about it the
[01:26:06 - 01:26:08] bottom line of another one's
[01:26:08 - 01:26:09] the same thing is different
[01:26:09 - 01:26:09] and so we don't want
[01:26:09 - 01:26:11] to account and say i
[01:26:11 - 01:26:19] have a guess of is
[01:26:19 - 01:26:19] that right i don't i'm
[01:26:19 - 01:26:21] just it's still not clear
[01:26:21 - 01:26:21] i mean if it's sort
[01:26:21 - 01:26:23] of an estimate how come
[01:26:23 - 01:26:25] you don't have a consistent
[01:26:25 - 01:26:27] estimate between years i understand
[01:26:27 - 01:26:27] that's fine it's good it
[01:26:27 - 01:26:30] just seems seems to me
[01:26:30 - 01:26:30] that if you have end
[01:26:32 - 01:26:32] of year and starting year
[01:26:32 - 01:26:34] it ought to be the
[01:26:34 - 01:26:34] same number or you ought
[01:26:34 - 01:26:44] to qualify your assumptions any
[01:26:44 - 01:26:44] other questions on 4 10
[01:26:47 - 01:26:50] other questions i okay mr

[01:29:10 - 01:29:10] bullets removed to the building
[01:29:12 - 01:29:12] it is partly for that
[01:29:12 - 01:29:14] and it's a renovation of
[01:29:14 - 01:29:16] the building um chair hagerty
[01:29:16 - 01:29:16] so it we we've operated
[01:29:16 - 01:29:18] in this building for quite
[01:29:18 - 01:29:21] some time and it was
[01:29:21 - 01:29:21] due for renovations and so

[01:29:23 - 01:29:26] of of that in addition
[01:29:26 - 01:29:28] to renovating any other questions
[01:29:28 - 01:29:31] just out of curiosity if

[01:29:39 - 01:29:39] law enforcement agencies around here
[01:29:39 - 01:29:40] to chip in because if
[01:29:40 - 01:29:43] they benefit from this i
[01:29:43 - 01:29:43] mean it seems like we
[01:29:43 - 01:29:45] ought to get the police
[01:29:45 - 01:29:49] department or the county sheriff
[01:29:49 - 01:29:49] or maybe the constables or

[01:38:03 - 01:38:07] programs programs okay okay wouldn't
[01:38:07 - 01:38:07] one of the things that
[01:38:07 - 01:38:14] having a bottlenecks if you
[01:38:14 - 01:38:17] will is having the trained
[01:38:17 - 01:38:17] faculty i mean you can
[01:38:17 - 01:38:19] ask extra time but you
[01:38:19 - 01:38:22] only have we're sort of
[01:38:22 - 01:38:22] maxed out on faculty hours
[01:38:22 - 01:38:24] is that you know yeah
[01:38:24 - 01:38:24] there's a couple of limiting
[01:38:27 - 01:38:27] factors to growing the program
[01:38:27 - 01:38:29] uh resources obviously rooms and
[01:38:29 - 01:38:31] and labs at the the
[01:38:31 - 01:38:32] college uh we've done great
[01:38:34 - 01:38:34] work in advancing uh opportunities
[01:38:34 - 01:38:39] there qualified faculty is uh
[01:38:39 - 01:38:41] a hurdle and um available
[01:38:41 - 01:38:41] clinical sites are also kind
[01:38:42 - 01:38:44] of a hurdle okay i
[01:38:44 - 01:38:44] i just want to point
[01:38:44 - 01:38:47] out would you go and
[01:38:47 - 01:38:47] tell us what your the
[01:38:47 - 01:38:50] uh the general pass rate
[01:38:50 - 01:38:53] has been for those programs
[01:38:53 - 01:38:53] over the last five years
[01:38:55 - 01:38:57] or sort of yeah generally
[01:38:57 - 01:38:57] uh the pass rate for
[01:39:00 - 01:39:03] accreditation purposes hovers around 90
[01:39:03 - 01:39:03] that's the the bar uh
[01:39:03 - 01:39:06] we've exceeded that in the
[01:39:06 - 01:39:09] last number of years so
[01:39:09 - 01:39:09] we hover uh depending on
[01:39:09 - 01:39:12] the program between 92 and
[01:39:12 - 01:39:16] 95 without being specific uh
[01:39:16 - 01:39:19] you know if i'm not
[01:39:19 - 01:39:19] correct that's exceeds the uh
[01:39:21 - 01:39:21] pass rate and the qualification
[01:39:21 - 01:39:23] rate of any other nursing
[01:39:23 - 01:39:25] program by any other institution
[01:39:25 - 01:39:25] here in town would that
[01:39:25 - 01:39:28] be correct i i'm going
[01:39:28 - 01:39:28] to qualify that we are
[01:39:31 - 01:39:31] absolutely one of the highest
[01:39:31 - 01:39:33] pass rate entities in the
[01:39:33 - 01:39:35] region so dr sata you
[01:39:35 - 01:39:35] need to give them a
