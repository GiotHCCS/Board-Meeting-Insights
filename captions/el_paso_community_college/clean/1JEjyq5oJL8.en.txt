[00:02:43 - 00:02:43] that i i don't have
[00:02:43 - 00:02:45] an issue i hope so
[00:02:45 - 00:02:45] because the legal counsel told
[00:02:47 - 00:02:47] me in the board meeting
[00:02:47 - 00:02:50] last time when i asked
[00:02:50 - 00:02:52] to do that it said
[00:02:52 - 00:02:52] no problem yeah there there's
[00:02:55 - 00:02:55] no issue with doing that
[00:02:56 - 00:02:56] we'll do that we'll do
[00:02:57 - 00:02:59] that okay okay go ahead
[00:02:59 - 00:03:04] doc on 37 so um
[00:03:04 - 00:03:08] obviously the um senate passed
[00:03:08 - 00:03:08] senate bill 37 um which
[00:03:08 - 00:03:09] passed senate bill 37 um
[00:03:10 - 00:03:12] which essentially essentially abolishes the
[00:03:12 - 00:03:12] faculty senate as it is
[00:03:16 - 00:03:16] known um today as of
[00:03:16 - 00:03:18] september 1st um we have
[00:03:18 - 00:03:18] been working closely with our
[00:03:21 - 00:03:21] faculty senate uh dr smith
[00:03:21 - 00:03:23] and i dr penley has
[00:03:23 - 00:03:25] has been instrumental in helping
[00:03:25 - 00:03:25] us with this as well
[00:03:25 - 00:03:28] as well as legal counsel
[00:03:28 - 00:03:30] um this institution has long
[00:03:30 - 00:03:33] recognized shared governance we believe
[00:03:33 - 00:03:33] in shared governance um so
[00:03:33 - 00:03:35] we have to move forward
[00:03:35 - 00:03:38] with the resolution in order
[00:03:38 - 00:03:38] to be in compliance with
[00:03:38 - 00:03:41] the state um and we
[00:03:41 - 00:03:44] are also moving forward with
[00:03:44 - 00:03:44] all of the areas that
[00:03:44 - 00:03:47] we have to uh implement
[00:03:47 - 00:03:47] by the 1st of september
[00:03:47 - 00:03:51] um this includes uh the
[00:03:51 - 00:03:53] board um i will have
[00:03:53 - 00:03:53] to appoint members of faculty
[00:03:56 - 00:03:56] senate including all the officers
[00:03:56 - 00:03:58] um not something that i
[00:03:58 - 00:04:00] was eager to do but
[00:04:00 - 00:04:00] it's what the law is
[00:04:00 - 00:04:03] and so i will comply
[00:04:03 - 00:04:03] with the law and we
[00:04:03 - 00:04:05] will ensure that we're in
[00:04:05 - 00:04:07] full compliance again legal counsel
[00:04:07 - 00:04:09] has provided excellence guidance for
[00:04:09 - 00:04:09] us as we continue to
[00:04:09 - 00:04:12] move forward and i ask
[00:04:12 - 00:04:12] miss min as well as
[00:04:15 - 00:04:15] uh as well as her
[00:04:15 - 00:04:17] colleague to provide any insight
[00:04:17 - 00:04:17] that they have with regards
[00:04:21 - 00:04:21] to the resolution i have
[00:04:21 - 00:04:25] a question out of this
[00:04:25 - 00:04:25] in the re the reappoint
[00:04:25 - 00:04:27] is the structure the organizational
[00:04:27 - 00:04:29] structure the line the chart
[00:04:29 - 00:04:32] organizational chart for the senate
[00:04:32 - 00:04:32] will it remain the same
[00:04:36 - 00:04:36] are you designating new physicians
[00:04:38 - 00:04:40] realigning responsibilities whatever your responsibility
[00:04:40 - 00:04:43] with this are you going
[00:04:43 - 00:04:43] to say the send is
[00:04:43 - 00:04:45] now organized and composed as
[00:04:45 - 00:04:47] previously we would have loved
[00:04:47 - 00:04:47] to have done it that
[00:04:47 - 00:04:48] way we're not allowed to
[00:04:48 - 00:04:48] do it that way so
[00:04:51 - 00:04:51] um miss maren myself other
[00:04:51 - 00:04:55] members of the institution um
[00:04:55 - 00:04:55] went to uh austin this
[00:04:55 - 00:04:59] past friday um to hear
[00:04:59 - 00:05:01] from tasby um association of
[00:05:01 - 00:05:04] school boards who provides um
[00:05:04 - 00:05:06] our legal policies um and
[00:05:06 - 00:05:06] get insight from them they
[00:05:06 - 00:05:09] made it very clear um
[00:05:09 - 00:05:09] that the reading is that
[00:05:11 - 00:05:11] i am responsible of appointing
[00:05:13 - 00:05:13] approximately a third of the
[00:05:13 - 00:05:16] faculty senate it can be
[00:05:16 - 00:05:16] comprised of up to 60
[00:05:18 - 00:05:18] members of which um each
[00:05:18 - 00:05:22] of the respective um divisions
[00:05:22 - 00:05:24] will appoint a member or
[00:05:24 - 00:05:24] elect a member rather and
[00:05:24 - 00:05:28] then i appoint um so
[00:05:28 - 00:05:30] the constitution of the uh
[00:05:30 - 00:05:30] composition of faculty senate will
[00:05:33 - 00:05:33] will change the officers um
[00:05:33 - 00:05:35] i am responsible for appointing
[00:05:35 - 00:05:37] they can serve up to
[00:05:37 - 00:05:38] six one-year terms and then
[00:05:39 - 00:05:39] they have to sit out
[00:05:39 - 00:05:42] for a two-year period those
[00:05:42 - 00:05:45] senators that are elected can
[00:05:45 - 00:05:45] be elected for one two-year
[00:05:45 - 00:05:46] term and then they have
[00:05:46 - 00:05:46] to sit out for two
[00:05:46 - 00:05:51] years after that term um
[00:05:51 - 00:05:53] and we obviously are working
[00:05:53 - 00:05:53] with faculty senate so that
[00:05:56 - 00:05:56] they can have their elections
[00:05:56 - 00:05:59] and have one they're looking
[00:05:59 - 00:06:01] at one-year terms and two-year
[00:06:01 - 00:06:01] terms so they're not all
[00:06:04 - 00:06:04] rolling over at the same
[00:06:04 - 00:06:05] time um as far as
[00:06:05 - 00:06:06] the organization of the faculty
[00:06:08 - 00:06:08] senate that will it can
[00:06:08 - 00:06:10] be no more than 60
[00:06:10 - 00:06:10] members we anticipate that ours
[00:06:10 - 00:06:12] will be approximately 42 members
[00:06:12 - 00:06:15] if i'm not mistaken dr
[00:06:15 - 00:06:17] smith um and again we're
[00:06:17 - 00:06:17] moving forward in that direction
[00:06:19 - 00:06:19] is that a significant change
[00:06:19 - 00:06:23] from what we had i
[00:06:23 - 00:06:23] mean what what exists today
[00:06:23 - 00:06:23] is the i mean what
[00:06:23 - 00:06:24] what exists today is the
[00:06:24 - 00:06:26] old old um what exists
[00:06:26 - 00:06:28] today is the faculty center
[00:06:28 - 00:06:29] as it was elected september
[00:06:29 - 00:06:31] one yeah as september 2nd
[00:06:31 - 00:06:34] is there a significant change
[00:06:34 - 00:06:37] in the organization the the
[00:06:37 - 00:06:37] the leadership of the senate
[00:06:39 - 00:06:39] no okay that's all currently
[00:06:39 - 00:06:40] there is no okay that's
[00:06:40 - 00:06:40] all currently there is none
[00:06:40 - 00:06:45] none none okay okay any
[00:06:45 - 00:06:47] other questions mine do you
[00:06:47 - 00:06:47] have any anything to add
[00:06:47 - 00:06:47] mine do you have any
[00:06:47 - 00:06:47] anything to add please please
[00:06:50 - 00:06:50] um just that we we
[00:06:50 - 00:06:54] need to adopt this the
[00:06:54 - 00:06:54] the law requires that the
[00:06:54 - 00:06:58] college if it's going to
[00:06:58 - 00:07:02] recognize a faculty senate that
[00:07:02 - 00:07:02] it be done by september
[00:07:02 - 00:07:06] 1st there is uh tasby
[00:07:06 - 00:07:06] is working on a a
[00:07:08 - 00:07:08] permanent policy with regard to
[00:07:08 - 00:07:10] that that you'll have and
[00:07:10 - 00:07:12] receive at some point in
[00:07:12 - 00:07:12] the probably late fall early
[00:07:16 - 00:07:16] winter the policy that we've
[00:07:16 - 00:07:19] attached is an interim policy
[00:07:19 - 00:07:21] it follows this the very
[00:07:21 - 00:07:21] closely the language of the
[00:07:22 - 00:07:22] statute and the requirements of
[00:07:22 - 00:07:24] what the college has to
[00:07:24 - 00:07:24] do with regard to the
[00:07:27 - 00:07:27] faculty senate uh but it
[00:07:27 - 00:07:29] is a temporary policy for
[00:07:29 - 00:07:32] all intents and purposes because
[00:07:32 - 00:07:32] the pol the college uses
[00:07:32 - 00:07:34] tasby for all of its
[00:07:34 - 00:07:38] policies it's just not ready
[00:07:38 - 00:07:38] so we've drafted together with
[00:07:43 - 00:07:43] administration the board policy 2
[00:07:43 - 00:07:45] 01 02 actually administration drafted
[00:07:45 - 00:07:48] it and we reviewed this
[00:07:48 - 00:07:51] policy and and that's what
[00:07:51 - 00:07:54] we're proposing it's important that
[00:07:54 - 00:07:54] you have also a resolution
[00:07:54 - 00:07:57] that i've given you today
[00:07:57 - 00:08:00] uh then that that become
[00:08:00 - 00:08:00] part of the board's record
[00:08:00 - 00:08:04] along with the policy so
[00:08:04 - 00:08:07] that it's clear in the
[00:08:07 - 00:08:07] pol in the minutes of
[00:08:07 - 00:08:09] the board that this resolution
[00:08:09 - 00:08:11] has been adopted and that
[00:08:11 - 00:08:11] the board has recognized the
[00:08:13 - 00:08:14] continuation of the faculty senate
[00:08:16 - 00:08:16] do we need to read
[00:08:16 - 00:08:18] the resolution i think it's
[00:08:18 - 00:08:18] best judge to have a
[00:08:20 - 00:08:20] clear record in the minutes
[00:08:23 - 00:08:26] okay got it bill do
[00:08:26 - 00:08:26] we need to vote or
[00:08:26 - 00:08:27] you have a first and
[00:08:27 - 00:08:29] a second you'll read it
[00:08:29 - 00:08:29] first and then and then
[00:08:31 - 00:08:31] the board will vote to
[00:08:31 - 00:08:31] adopt or not the board
[00:08:31 - 00:08:32] will vote to adopt or
[00:08:33 - 00:08:35] not adopt adopt resolution authorizing
[00:08:35 - 00:08:37] the continuation and ratification of
[00:08:37 - 00:08:39] the faculty senate whereas during
[00:08:39 - 00:08:42] the 89th texas legislative session
[00:08:42 - 00:08:44] in 2025 the texas legislature
[00:08:44 - 00:08:44] passed senate bill 37 which
[00:08:46 - 00:08:46] was subsequently signed into law
[00:08:46 - 00:08:50] by governor greg abbott on
[00:08:50 - 00:08:52] june 20 2025 whereas senate
[00:08:52 - 00:08:52] bill 37 relates to the
[00:08:54 - 00:08:54] governance of public institutions of
[00:08:56 - 00:08:56] higher education including review of

[00:10:56 - 00:10:59] 6th day of august 2025
[00:10:59 - 00:11:01] by the board of trustees
[00:11:01 - 00:11:01] of el paso county community
[00:11:03 - 00:11:06] college district anybody have any
[00:11:06 - 00:11:10] other questions if i understand
[00:11:10 - 00:11:10] this three three if i
[00:11:10 - 00:11:12] understand this three three 513522
[00:11:12 - 00:11:14] 513522 acknowledges that that it's
[00:11:16 - 00:11:18] discretionary at each institution whether
[00:11:18 - 00:11:18] don't have it back or
[00:11:18 - 00:11:21] send a senate or not
[00:11:21 - 00:11:21] but if they do they
[00:11:21 - 00:11:23] they set out the organ
[00:11:23 - 00:11:26] organizational structure which you you
[00:11:26 - 00:11:28] identify is that correct because
[00:11:28 - 00:11:28] there's some i guess you
[00:11:29 - 00:11:30] there's some institutions some colleges
[00:11:32 - 00:11:32] or that don't have as
[00:11:32 - 00:11:35] correct that's correct um it
[00:11:35 - 00:11:37] it spells out very clearly
[00:11:37 - 00:11:37] that the faculty senate is
[00:11:40 - 00:11:40] purely an advisory board um
[00:11:40 - 00:11:42] that they have no authority
[00:11:42 - 00:11:42] in any of the actions
[00:11:46 - 00:11:46] of the institution it's very
[00:11:46 - 00:11:49] specific um but again uh
[00:11:49 - 00:11:51] from my perspective and from
[00:11:51 - 00:11:53] the administration's perspective we believe
[00:11:53 - 00:11:53] in shared governance and we
[00:11:54 - 00:11:54] believe that it's important for
[00:11:54 - 00:11:56] the institution to continue but
[00:11:56 - 00:11:57] it's discretionary as whether we
[00:11:57 - 00:11:59] have one or not that's
[00:11:59 - 00:12:01] correct not that's correct okay
[00:12:01 - 00:12:04] okay but by by voting
[00:12:04 - 00:12:04] on this 5 4 before
[00:12:04 - 00:12:06] this includes is already in

[00:12:55 - 00:12:55] planning will make a presentation
[00:12:57 - 00:12:57] on the update of the
[00:12:57 - 00:13:24] college district's good afternoon um
[00:13:24 - 00:13:28] this presentation is a quick
[00:13:28 - 00:13:28] overview of where uh we
[00:13:28 - 00:13:30] have been and and where
[00:13:30 - 00:13:30] you have been as a
[00:13:33 - 00:13:33] board uh where we are
[00:13:33 - 00:13:35] as of today and where
[00:13:35 - 00:13:35] we are moving forward with
[00:13:35 - 00:13:37] our next strategic plan uh
[00:13:37 - 00:13:40] before i get started a
[00:13:40 - 00:13:40] huge shout out to rachel
[00:13:43 - 00:13:43] vontes in dr smith's office
[00:13:43 - 00:13:46] for drafting the visuals there
[00:13:46 - 00:13:49] is no way i could
[00:13:49 - 00:13:51] have done this myself um
[00:13:51 - 00:13:51] so this is the crux
[00:13:51 - 00:13:53] of the presentation um and
[00:13:53 - 00:13:55] and if you're crunched for
[00:13:55 - 00:13:55] time we can stop here
[00:13:55 - 00:13:57] and and you can move
[00:13:57 - 00:13:58] on but uh you might
[00:14:01 - 00:14:01] remember last summer um i
[00:14:01 - 00:14:05] came to you during your
[00:14:05 - 00:14:05] uh summer retreat and i
[00:14:07 - 00:14:07] presented at that time the
[00:14:07 - 00:14:09] current mission and vision statement
[00:14:09 - 00:14:11] and uh i asked you
[00:14:11 - 00:14:11] to put your thinking caps
[00:14:11 - 00:14:14] on and make some decisions
[00:14:14 - 00:14:18] whether those statements were still
[00:14:18 - 00:14:20] uh accurate in in the
[00:14:20 - 00:14:20] next five years or whether
[00:14:20 - 00:14:24] you might want to revise
[00:14:24 - 00:14:29] them um after that cabinet
[00:14:29 - 00:14:29] uh began talking about um
[00:14:29 - 00:14:32] the the structure of our
[00:14:32 - 00:14:34] work in the near future
[00:14:34 - 00:14:34] uh taking a page out
[00:14:34 - 00:14:37] of dr saja's book uh
[00:14:37 - 00:14:37] with the four pillars of
[00:14:39 - 00:14:39] student success that that we
[00:14:39 - 00:14:41] talked about at the retreat
[00:14:41 - 00:14:43] uh with entry progress completion
[00:14:43 - 00:14:45] and career so while you
[00:14:45 - 00:14:45] were doing your homework with
[00:14:47 - 00:14:47] the mission and vision we
[00:14:47 - 00:14:50] were doing our homework uh
[00:14:50 - 00:14:53] beginning to craft some general
[00:14:53 - 00:14:53] statements um and general goals
[00:14:55 - 00:14:55] and outcomes that hopefully would
[00:14:55 - 00:14:57] align with that mission and
[00:14:57 - 00:14:59] vision so we were we
[00:14:59 - 00:14:59] were working together during uh
[00:15:02 - 00:15:02] during that part of 2024
[00:15:02 - 00:15:05] um earlier this year uh
[00:15:05 - 00:15:09] the board came together and
[00:15:09 - 00:15:09] uh finalized and ultimately approved
[00:15:12 - 00:15:12] the new mission and mission
[00:15:12 - 00:15:17] statement and uh at that
[00:15:17 - 00:15:17] time cabinet um once we
[00:15:19 - 00:15:20] had the green light had
[00:15:21 - 00:15:25] the green light sorry i
[00:15:25 - 00:15:25] didn't know if i needed
[00:15:25 - 00:15:27] to use my teacher voice
[00:15:27 - 00:15:27] um once we had the
[00:15:27 - 00:15:29] green light in terms of
[00:15:29 - 00:15:32] mission and vision then we
[00:15:32 - 00:15:32] were able to begin finalizing
[00:15:32 - 00:15:35] uh the goals and outcomes
[00:15:35 - 00:15:37] that together with your statements
[00:15:37 - 00:15:40] created the skeleton of our
[00:15:40 - 00:15:44] strategic plan that plan is
[00:15:44 - 00:15:44] uh in its very final
[00:15:44 - 00:15:46] stages uh with dr mo
[00:15:46 - 00:15:50] and uh director christy frescus
[00:15:50 - 00:15:50] on the uh visuals that
[00:15:50 - 00:15:52] will be presented and provided
[00:15:52 - 00:15:54] to the college employees and
[00:15:54 - 00:15:54] and to you as well
[00:15:54 - 00:15:56] as to our external stakeholders
[00:15:56 - 00:15:59] uh the plan itself goes
[00:15:59 - 00:16:02] into effect and is officially
[00:16:02 - 00:16:05] launched on september 1st at
[00:16:05 - 00:16:05] that time uh budget heads

[00:16:15 - 00:16:15] alignment and in support of
[00:16:15 - 00:16:17] the strategic plan we we

[00:18:30 - 00:18:32] will fit nicely in a
[00:18:32 - 00:18:32] booklet and on a poster
[00:18:41 - 00:18:41] been doing uh some terrific
[00:18:41 - 00:18:43] work uh with the visuals
[00:18:43 - 00:18:43] uh with with her marketing
[00:18:46 - 00:18:46] team um but the crux
[00:18:46 - 00:18:50] of this statement is um
[00:18:50 - 00:18:50] again providing not only the
[00:18:51 - 00:18:54] educational opportunities but the supports
[00:18:54 - 00:18:56] the experiences that holistic college
[00:18:56 - 00:18:59] experience um to help not
[00:18:59 - 00:19:01] only the individual student but
[00:19:01 - 00:19:03] their families the community uh
[00:19:03 - 00:19:03] and the the region that
[00:19:03 - 00:19:10] we and this uh is
[00:19:10 - 00:19:10] not a statement that you
[00:19:14 - 00:19:14] all um have approved your
[00:19:14 - 00:19:16] your uh focus is on
[00:19:16 - 00:19:16] the mission and vision as
[00:19:16 - 00:19:21] it should be uh but
[00:19:21 - 00:19:21] we took that um vision
[00:19:24 - 00:19:24] if you will that that
[00:19:24 - 00:19:26] philosophy of epcc a step
[00:19:26 - 00:19:26] further by generating a student
[00:19:28 - 00:19:28] success statement uh we used
[00:19:28 - 00:19:31] to have an equity statement
[00:19:31 - 00:19:34] for reasons that we will
[00:19:34 - 00:19:34] not discuss we are not
[00:19:34 - 00:19:36] uh touting it as an
[00:19:36 - 00:19:36] equity statement the spirit of
[00:19:39 - 00:19:39] this is is very similar
[00:19:39 - 00:19:42] though we we see students
[00:19:42 - 00:19:42] as individuals uh and and
[00:19:44 - 00:19:44] the heart of this statement
[00:19:44 - 00:19:46] is in the last sentence
[00:19:46 - 00:19:46] uh we are committed to
[00:19:50 - 00:19:50] success for every student and
[00:19:50 - 00:19:53] um for creating opportunities for
[00:19:53 - 00:19:55] that student and providing resources
[00:19:55 - 00:20:00] and support for that student
[00:20:00 - 00:20:00] um so again your role
[00:20:00 - 00:20:02] as a board is to
[00:20:02 - 00:20:02] uh give us direction through
[00:20:03 - 00:20:03] the mission and vision you
[00:20:03 - 00:20:06] did that beautifully we uh
[00:20:06 - 00:20:09] added the student success statement
[00:20:09 - 00:20:09] to double down on our
[00:20:11 - 00:20:11] commitment to um supporting every
[00:20:14 - 00:20:14] student meeting them where they
[00:20:14 - 00:20:16] are and now we're ready
[00:20:16 - 00:20:16] to go back to the
[00:20:18 - 00:20:18] goals and outcomes again this
[00:20:18 - 00:20:20] is something that cabinet worked
[00:20:20 - 00:20:22] on there was a lot
[00:20:22 - 00:20:22] of back and forth a
[00:20:22 - 00:20:26] lot of intentional conversations um
[00:20:26 - 00:20:26] how we would support those
[00:20:26 - 00:20:29] four pillars that dr sarata
[00:20:29 - 00:20:32] has mentioned um in multiple
[00:20:32 - 00:20:32] presentations and how we can
[00:20:35 - 00:20:35] get a little bit more
[00:20:35 - 00:20:38] specific in what it means
[00:20:38 - 00:20:38] to meet a goal of
[00:20:38 - 00:20:41] progress or a goal of
[00:20:41 - 00:20:41] completion so this is what
[00:20:41 - 00:20:43] we will be rolling out
[00:20:43 - 00:20:46] with our strategic plan um
[00:20:46 - 00:20:46] what you may notice um
[00:20:49 - 00:20:49] particularly for returning trustees is
[00:20:51 - 00:20:51] we now have some quantifiable
[00:20:51 - 00:20:54] metrics associated with these outcomes
[00:20:54 - 00:20:57] uh to better provide budget
[00:20:57 - 00:21:00] heads uh and everyone at
[00:21:00 - 00:21:00] the college with some um
[00:21:03 - 00:21:03] clear tracking if you will
[00:21:03 - 00:21:04] uh of of how we
[00:21:04 - 00:21:04] are doing towards achieving these
[00:21:09 - 00:21:09] goals many of these goals
[00:21:09 - 00:21:11] uh align with what the
[00:21:11 - 00:21:11] support uh what the state
[00:21:11 - 00:21:13] has identified as valuable in
[00:21:13 - 00:21:17] terms of funding formulas um
[00:21:17 - 00:21:18] it also aligns with some
[00:21:18 - 00:21:18] of our existing work with
[00:21:18 - 00:21:22] our quality enhancement plan so
[00:21:22 - 00:21:24] although the words maybe some
[00:21:24 - 00:21:27] of the metrics may appear
[00:21:27 - 00:21:27] new to employees or or
[00:21:27 - 00:21:30] perhaps to you they're really
[00:21:30 - 00:21:32] a continuation and an explication
[00:21:32 - 00:21:32] of the work we've been
[00:21:35 - 00:21:37] doing for for years um
[00:21:37 - 00:21:37] some of you have probably
[00:21:37 - 00:21:39] noticed there's an asterisk at
[00:21:39 - 00:21:41] the very bottom uh that
[00:21:41 - 00:21:41] one does not have a
[00:21:41 - 00:21:43] metric associated with it i
[00:21:43 - 00:21:46] will come back to that
[00:21:46 - 00:21:46] because you'll see that um
[00:21:46 - 00:21:50] outcome on each of our
[00:21:50 - 00:21:50] goals so um any on
[00:21:50 - 00:21:51] each of our goals so
[00:21:51 - 00:21:55] um any questions questions uh
[00:21:55 - 00:21:55] or comments about the outcomes
[00:22:03 - 00:22:03] okay uh moving on to
[00:22:03 - 00:22:05] progress uh as students not
[00:22:05 - 00:22:05] only have come to the
[00:22:08 - 00:22:08] college and and identified their
[00:22:08 - 00:22:10] area of concentration how we
[00:22:10 - 00:22:12] can get them to successfully
[00:22:12 - 00:22:12] complete that first half of
[00:22:15 - 00:22:15] their program uh so we
[00:22:15 - 00:22:18] identified some some key metrics
[00:22:18 - 00:22:18] that we have found to
[00:22:20 - 00:22:20] be important in that student
[00:22:20 - 00:22:22] success during those critical uh
[00:22:22 - 00:22:25] first semesters a lot of
[00:22:25 - 00:22:27] this is supported by national
[00:22:27 - 00:22:27] research um uh you may
[00:22:27 - 00:22:29] have heard dr set out
[00:22:29 - 00:22:31] to talk about uh gateway
[00:22:31 - 00:22:31] courses in english and math
[00:22:32 - 00:22:34] tend to be bottlenecks for
[00:22:34 - 00:22:36] students so we we brought
[00:22:36 - 00:22:36] that to the forefront of
[00:22:36 - 00:22:42] some of our focus um
[00:22:42 - 00:22:42] dual credit is also a
[00:22:42 - 00:22:45] growing uh population and is
[00:22:45 - 00:22:48] something that is uh uh
[00:22:48 - 00:22:48] you heard from dean bedo
[00:22:48 - 00:22:50] uh last week about the
[00:22:50 - 00:22:50] growth in dual credit so
[00:22:50 - 00:22:52] we we want to uh
[00:22:52 - 00:22:55] bring that to the forefront
[00:22:55 - 00:22:55] as well and again you'll
[00:22:55 - 00:22:59] see that uh catchall final
[00:22:59 - 00:23:07] outcome of so once we
[00:23:07 - 00:23:09] uh have students and supported
[00:23:09 - 00:23:10] students successfully through their first
[00:23:10 - 00:23:10] half of the program our
[00:23:13 - 00:23:13] work is obviously not done
[00:23:13 - 00:23:16] and so our completion goal
[00:23:16 - 00:23:19] focuses on getting students to
[00:23:19 - 00:23:19] complete their award um and
[00:23:21 - 00:23:21] so these types of outcomes
[00:23:21 - 00:23:24] focus on that second half
[00:23:24 - 00:23:24] of a student's program uh
[00:23:27 - 00:23:29] obviously the total awards um
[00:23:29 - 00:23:29] not just an award for
[00:23:29 - 00:23:32] an award's sake but an
[00:23:32 - 00:23:32] award in a meaningful high
[00:23:36 - 00:23:36] demand uh high wage program
[00:23:36 - 00:23:38] in our area uh we
[00:23:38 - 00:23:38] we obviously don't want students
[00:23:43 - 00:23:43] to um rack up a
[00:23:43 - 00:23:43] lot of of credits or
[00:23:43 - 00:23:45] a lot of hours that
[00:23:45 - 00:23:45] are not going to meet
[00:23:47 - 00:23:47] their needs and so we
[00:23:47 - 00:23:50] we brought that in as
[00:23:50 - 00:23:52] a fourth outcome and then
[00:23:52 - 00:23:52] that last outcome uh which
[00:23:52 - 00:23:54] is beginning to look familiar
[00:23:54 - 00:23:56] to you i'm sure supporting
[00:23:56 - 00:23:59] other departments in their goal
[00:23:59 - 00:24:04] efforts and then our last
[00:24:04 - 00:24:04] goal um is um that
[00:24:06 - 00:24:09] continuation in their educational journey
[00:24:09 - 00:24:09] or for students that are
[00:24:09 - 00:24:12] focused more on direct work
[00:24:12 - 00:24:14] uh credentials supporting them in
[00:24:14 - 00:24:17] that arena as well so
[00:24:17 - 00:24:17] this is sort of a
[00:24:17 - 00:24:20] split goal for us um
[00:24:20 - 00:24:20] continuing to work with our
[00:24:20 - 00:24:22] regional uh partners through our
[00:24:22 - 00:24:23] advisory committees and other outlets
[00:24:23 - 00:24:26] to make sure that we
[00:24:26 - 00:24:29] are meeting the community's demand
[00:24:29 - 00:24:32] for highquality program uh training
[00:24:32 - 00:24:32] um lensure rates for many
[00:24:32 - 00:24:34] of our programs is an
[00:24:34 - 00:24:38] important part of getting students
[00:24:38 - 00:24:38] into the workforce um getting
[00:24:38 - 00:24:39] students into the workforce um
[00:24:39 - 00:24:47] transfer transfer so far so
[00:24:47 - 00:24:51] good all right so that
[00:24:51 - 00:24:51] fifth goal um it is
[00:24:56 - 00:24:56] uh designed to help um
[00:24:56 - 00:25:00] divisions such as mine um
[00:25:00 - 00:25:00] perhaps uh such as uh
[00:25:02 - 00:25:04] information technology finance and administrative
[00:25:04 - 00:25:06] operations we don't have many
[00:25:06 - 00:25:10] opportunities to directly interact interact
[00:25:10 - 00:25:10] with students um our role
[00:25:10 - 00:25:14] is more of a support
[00:25:14 - 00:25:14] um function and so in
[00:25:16 - 00:25:16] order for us to see
[00:25:16 - 00:25:20] ourselves in our strategic plan
[00:25:20 - 00:25:20] and to make um important
[00:25:24 - 00:25:24] and meaningful area plans we
[00:25:24 - 00:25:28] added this uh this outcome
[00:25:28 - 00:25:28] as a way to provide
[00:25:28 - 00:25:31] that support whether it's uh
[00:25:31 - 00:25:33] by partnering with the education
[00:25:33 - 00:25:35] workforce division or partnering with
[00:25:35 - 00:25:38] student enrollment services or partnering
[00:25:38 - 00:25:42] with one another um to
[00:25:42 - 00:25:42] create ways to fulfill the
[00:25:45 - 00:25:45] strategic plan goals and outcomes
[00:25:45 - 00:25:49] um for example um my
[00:25:49 - 00:25:50] uh the institutional research department
[00:25:50 - 00:25:53] which is in my division
[00:25:53 - 00:25:53] the director uh came to
[00:25:53 - 00:25:55] me yesterday and said what
[00:25:55 - 00:25:59] do you think about creating
[00:25:59 - 00:26:02] some better dashboards to track
[00:26:02 - 00:26:02] each one of these outcomes
[00:26:02 - 00:26:04] and i said that would
[00:26:04 - 00:26:07] be terrific and maybe you
[00:26:07 - 00:26:07] could work with it to
[00:26:07 - 00:26:09] help um that department we
[00:26:09 - 00:26:13] can come together and create
[00:26:13 - 00:26:13] a really powerful um dashboard
[00:26:13 - 00:26:15] uh whether it's enhancing ing
[00:26:15 - 00:26:17] our current structure or creating
[00:26:17 - 00:26:19] something new so that everybody
[00:26:19 - 00:26:23] can easily track this work
[00:26:23 - 00:26:23] and not get um lost
[00:26:23 - 00:26:26] in the wilderness if you
[00:26:26 - 00:26:28] will so that's why that's
[00:26:28 - 00:26:32] why that outcome is there
[00:26:32 - 00:26:32] and that is all i
[00:26:32 - 00:26:35] had i am happy to
[00:26:35 - 00:26:35] answer any questions we we
[00:26:35 - 00:26:37] are so excited about the
[00:26:37 - 00:26:37] strategic plan or or i
[00:26:39 - 00:26:39] am so excited about the
[00:26:39 - 00:26:42] strategic plan um and i
[00:26:42 - 00:26:42] hope that that comes through
[00:26:44 - 00:26:44] i i have a question
[00:26:44 - 00:26:49] yes sir how did we
[00:26:49 - 00:26:49] do uh up to 2024
[00:26:49 - 00:26:51] on our past strategic plan
[00:26:53 - 00:26:53] did we meet every goal
[00:26:53 - 00:26:55] 100 did we meet every
[00:26:55 - 00:26:59] goal 100 um um i
[00:26:59 - 00:26:59] do not have that number
[00:26:59 - 00:27:02] with me i would say
[00:27:02 - 00:27:02] um likely not because we
[00:27:02 - 00:27:04] did not have specific numbers
[00:27:04 - 00:27:06] for the for the current
[00:27:06 - 00:27:06] strategic plan that still is
[00:27:09 - 00:27:09] in place until august 31st
[00:27:09 - 00:27:11] we are gathering some baseline
[00:27:11 - 00:27:14] data right now which will
[00:27:14 - 00:27:14] serve not only to guide
[00:27:14 - 00:27:16] us on this incoming strategic
[00:27:16 - 00:27:18] plan but it will tell
[00:27:18 - 00:27:18] us where we are on
[00:27:18 - 00:27:19] the current tell us where
[00:27:19 - 00:27:19] we are on the current
[00:27:19 - 00:27:23] plan plan so uh maybe
[00:27:23 - 00:27:23] in one of the upcoming
[00:27:23 - 00:27:25] board meetings you can bring
[00:27:25 - 00:27:25] us up to date and
[00:27:27 - 00:27:27] let us know how we
[00:27:27 - 00:27:30] did on the past sure
[00:27:30 - 00:27:30] sure absolutely happy to do
[00:27:30 - 00:27:33] that so that we don't
[00:27:33 - 00:27:36] skip something we missed in
[00:27:36 - 00:27:36] our next five years missed
[00:27:36 - 00:27:37] in our next five years
[00:27:38 - 00:27:40] absolutely absolutely i think that's
[00:27:40 - 00:27:43] um a great suggestion judge
[00:27:43 - 00:27:43] um we had some in
[00:27:43 - 00:27:46] our strategic plan which at
[00:27:46 - 00:27:46] the time that we um
[00:27:46 - 00:27:47] voted made sense for the
[00:27:47 - 00:27:51] institution it was prior to
[00:27:51 - 00:27:51] certain laws passing um and
[00:27:51 - 00:27:53] so some of them it's
[00:27:53 - 00:27:56] not in our best interest
[00:27:56 - 00:27:56] to um to report on
[00:27:56 - 00:27:59] i'll give an example so
[00:27:59 - 00:28:01] our goals and outcomes goal
[00:28:01 - 00:28:01] two is drive student success
[00:28:01 - 00:28:03] dr p is absolutely correct
[00:28:03 - 00:28:06] doesn't have specific metrics um
[00:28:06 - 00:28:08] but we can provide data
[00:28:08 - 00:28:08] on those but for instance
[00:28:08 - 00:28:10] one of the goals under
[00:28:10 - 00:28:12] driving student success was close
[00:28:12 - 00:28:15] equity gaps and student outcomes
[00:28:15 - 00:28:15] uh that in today's uh
[00:28:15 - 00:28:17] body politic is not something
[00:28:17 - 00:28:19] that we would be reporting
[00:28:19 - 00:28:19] on which is based on
[00:28:19 - 00:28:22] senate bill 17 that passed
[00:28:22 - 00:28:24] in 2023 um but there's
[00:28:24 - 00:28:24] others that we can you
[00:28:27 - 00:28:28] know facilitating college transitions preparing
[00:28:28 - 00:28:31] students with marketable skills for
[00:28:31 - 00:28:31] gainful employment um but we
[00:28:34 - 00:28:34] can we can bring um
[00:28:34 - 00:28:37] a report to the board
[00:28:37 - 00:28:37] and and show you as
[00:28:37 - 00:28:40] as we launch this one
[00:28:40 - 00:28:40] this one will launch uh
[00:28:40 - 00:28:42] the 1 of september and
[00:28:42 - 00:28:42] we can bring we can
[00:28:44 - 00:28:44] make sure that we have
[00:28:44 - 00:28:47] time um in the fall
[00:28:47 - 00:28:47] to report to the board
[00:28:47 - 00:28:49] where we were on meeting
[00:28:49 - 00:28:49] those uh at the same
[00:28:52 - 00:28:52] time i reminded the board
[00:28:52 - 00:28:55] that that strategic plan was
[00:28:55 - 00:28:57] during the um pandemic co
[00:28:59 - 00:28:59] i give dr emily a
[00:28:59 - 00:29:01] whole lot of credit for
[00:29:01 - 00:29:01] getting that strategic plan up
[00:29:01 - 00:29:03] and running and through during
[00:29:03 - 00:29:07] the pandemic um but i'm
[00:29:07 - 00:29:07] i'm sure there are goals
[00:29:07 - 00:29:09] that we didn't meet given
[00:29:09 - 00:29:13] the moment goals etc um
[00:29:13 - 00:29:15] that the pandemic impacted and
[00:29:15 - 00:29:15] remind me again how do
[00:29:15 - 00:29:17] how do we monitor the
[00:29:17 - 00:29:21] progress we're making so the
[00:29:21 - 00:29:21] the um excellent question mrs
[00:29:25 - 00:29:25] moy and the the strategic
[00:29:25 - 00:29:28] plan is so exciting because
[00:29:28 - 00:29:28] it is going to be
[00:29:28 - 00:29:29] how the budget heads are
[00:29:29 - 00:29:32] going to create their area
[00:29:32 - 00:29:32] plan so uh myself my
[00:29:34 - 00:29:34] colleagues in the room any
[00:29:34 - 00:29:36] budget head at the college
[00:29:36 - 00:29:36] will be generating a new
[00:29:38 - 00:29:38] area plan for the academic
[00:29:38 - 00:29:41] year they will pick one
[00:29:41 - 00:29:41] of these metrics to focus
[00:29:45 - 00:29:45] on we will have the
[00:29:45 - 00:29:49] baselines um for uh at
[00:29:49 - 00:29:49] the aggregate level they can
[00:29:49 - 00:29:49] uh try at the aggregate
[00:29:49 - 00:29:50] level they can uh try
[00:29:50 - 00:29:54] to to say for example
[00:29:54 - 00:29:54] uh number one on the
[00:29:57 - 00:29:57] screen i'm going to focus
[00:29:57 - 00:29:59] on a an area plan
[00:29:59 - 00:29:59] targeting career exploration in and
[00:30:01 - 00:30:01] out of the classroom by
[00:30:01 - 00:30:03] 5 so we'll have that
[00:30:03 - 00:30:03] baseline number they may uh
[00:30:05 - 00:30:05] they're going to outline how
[00:30:05 - 00:30:07] they're going to do it
[00:30:07 - 00:30:10] they have quarterly updates that
[00:30:10 - 00:30:10] they provide and so by
[00:30:10 - 00:30:13] the end of the year
[00:30:13 - 00:30:16] by um next september october
[00:30:16 - 00:30:16] of 26 they'll have their
[00:30:17 - 00:30:17] baseline data they'll have where
[00:30:18 - 00:30:19] they ended up they'll have
[00:30:19 - 00:30:22] the interim steps along the
[00:30:22 - 00:30:22] way they can say you
[00:30:22 - 00:30:25] know i i did it
[00:30:25 - 00:30:25] yay me or they can
[00:30:25 - 00:30:27] say i didn't quite hit
[00:30:27 - 00:30:27] that mark i want to
[00:30:29 - 00:30:29] extend the plan and double
[00:30:29 - 00:30:31] up my effort so it's
[00:30:31 - 00:30:31] more at the individual level
[00:30:31 - 00:30:35] but it is uh accountability
[00:30:35 - 00:30:37] through our um actually through
[00:30:37 - 00:30:40] the software that you all
[00:30:40 - 00:30:40] were were so kind to
[00:30:40 - 00:30:42] approve uh at last week's
[00:30:42 - 00:30:42] board meeting that that uh
[00:30:44 - 00:30:44] software was to document the
[00:30:44 - 00:30:46] planning efforts at the college
[00:30:47 - 00:30:47] at any point they can
[00:30:47 - 00:30:48] re-trigger at any point they
[00:30:48 - 00:30:50] can re-trigger evaluation evaluation absolutely
[00:30:50 - 00:30:52] absolutely they don't have to
[00:30:52 - 00:30:52] generate a new plan every
[00:30:52 - 00:30:54] year they are welcome to
[00:30:54 - 00:30:54] or they can extend the
[00:30:56 - 00:30:56] plan sometimes work takes a
[00:30:56 - 00:30:59] little bit more than a
[00:30:59 - 00:30:59] year to to achieve so
[00:31:00 - 00:31:00] and when we're doing any
[00:31:00 - 00:31:03] type of expenses do we
[00:31:03 - 00:31:03] point back to how is
[00:31:05 - 00:31:05] this expense going to tie
[00:31:05 - 00:31:09] to this specific action well
[00:31:09 - 00:31:09] we we tie um the
[00:31:09 - 00:31:12] planning into the budget development
[00:31:12 - 00:31:14] process so uh our director
[00:31:14 - 00:31:16] of institutional planning uh comes
[00:31:16 - 00:31:19] to the budget workshop presentations
[00:31:19 - 00:31:19] in february to to align
[00:31:21 - 00:31:21] that because it it is
[00:31:21 - 00:31:24] resource allocation and it it
[00:31:24 - 00:31:27] um justifies to our stakeholders
[00:31:27 - 00:31:27] not only how we're using
[00:31:29 - 00:31:29] those resources but if we
[00:31:29 - 00:31:34] might need additional resources for
[00:31:34 - 00:31:34] a specific purpose not just
[00:31:34 - 00:31:37] i i need more money
[00:31:37 - 00:31:37] for xyz but you know
[00:31:37 - 00:31:39] tying everything we do back
[00:31:39 - 00:31:40] to that strategic plan in
[00:31:40 - 00:31:40] support of the mission and
[00:31:40 - 00:31:41] plan in support of the

[00:34:03 - 00:34:07] director at the june 25th
[00:34:07 - 00:34:09] budget workshop i had said
[00:34:09 - 00:34:09] that the main goal is
[00:34:09 - 00:34:11] developing a sustainable budget well
[00:34:11 - 00:34:14] that has not changed it
[00:34:14 - 00:34:14] is still the main goal
[00:34:14 - 00:34:17] to produce a sustainable budget
[00:34:17 - 00:34:20] the other thing that we
[00:34:20 - 00:34:20] talked about uh were that
[00:34:23 - 00:34:23] on june 25th many of
[00:34:23 - 00:34:26] the numbers that were presented
[00:34:26 - 00:34:28] were preliminary so we're a
[00:34:28 - 00:34:28] little bit of over a
[00:34:28 - 00:34:32] month later and the numbers
[00:34:32 - 00:34:33] have firmed up quite a
[00:34:33 - 00:34:34] bit we have better numbers
[00:34:37 - 00:34:40] better estimates for expenditures and
[00:34:40 - 00:34:40] so today we're going to
[00:34:40 - 00:34:42] look at the numbers of
[00:34:42 - 00:34:42] these as as they've rolled
[00:34:45 - 00:34:45] forward and uh go over
[00:34:45 - 00:34:47] that in a little bit
[00:34:47 - 00:34:52] more detail so our agenda
[00:34:52 - 00:34:52] today is is um just
[00:34:52 - 00:34:54] to say that one budget
[00:34:54 - 00:34:58] workshop is under our belt
[00:34:58 - 00:34:58] it's provided on june the
[00:34:58 - 00:35:00] 25th and so now we
[00:35:00 - 00:35:04] have updated the baseline budget
[00:35:04 - 00:35:04] as of june 30th at
[00:35:04 - 00:35:06] the june 25th presentation it
[00:35:06 - 00:35:11] was updated through may the
[00:35:11 - 00:35:11] 31st it is advanced by
[00:35:11 - 00:35:13] one month and we've updated
[00:35:13 - 00:35:15] the revenues for fiscal year
[00:35:15 - 00:35:19] 2425 which become the basis
[00:35:19 - 00:35:21] for the 2526 budget so
[00:35:21 - 00:35:21] it's very important to update
[00:35:25 - 00:35:25] the current revenues to predict
[00:35:25 - 00:35:27] what the revenues might be
[00:35:27 - 00:35:30] for next year in addition
[00:35:30 - 00:35:30] uh dr sarat has vetted
[00:35:30 - 00:35:32] the additional request with the
[00:35:32 - 00:35:34] vice presidents that are uh
[00:35:34 - 00:35:35] in attendance presidents that are
[00:35:36 - 00:35:37] uh in attendance today today
[00:35:39 - 00:35:39] and so you're going to
[00:35:39 - 00:35:43] see revised funding strategies based
[00:35:43 - 00:35:45] upon updated revenue projections and
[00:35:45 - 00:35:47] this will help in your
[00:35:47 - 00:35:47] decision- making later as you
[00:35:51 - 00:35:54] consider a salary increase so
[00:35:54 - 00:35:54] then we will at the
[00:35:54 - 00:35:56] end of the presentation talk
[00:35:56 - 00:35:59] about next steps towards developing
[00:35:59 - 00:36:02] a fiscal year 2526 operating
[00:36:02 - 00:36:05] budget so how does the
[00:36:05 - 00:36:05] current year budget so how
[00:36:05 - 00:36:06] does the current year budget
[00:36:07 - 00:36:09] revenues revenues how do the
[00:36:09 - 00:36:09] current budget year revenues how
[00:36:09 - 00:36:10] do the current budget year
[00:36:10 - 00:36:13] revenues look look so for
[00:36:13 - 00:36:13] state appropriations we see we
[00:36:17 - 00:36:17] have a positive variance of
[00:36:17 - 00:36:17] 4 9 have a positive
[00:36:17 - 00:36:18] variance of 4 9 million
[00:36:18 - 00:36:22] million that is about 175
[00:36:23 - 00:36:23] that that is about close
[00:36:23 - 00:36:26] to the number we predicted
[00:36:26 - 00:36:26] at the june 25th budget
[00:36:30 - 00:36:35] workshop up 11 11 uh
[00:36:35 - 00:36:35] overhead recovery is slightly down
[00:36:35 - 00:36:38] uh 84 000 a minimal
[00:36:38 - 00:36:38] amount and so when we
[00:36:41 - 00:36:41] look at local funds tuition
[00:36:41 - 00:36:49] and fees at the june
[00:36:49 - 00:36:53] 25th presentation they were up
[00:36:53 - 00:36:53] about 3 5 million they
[00:36:53 - 00:36:56] were predicted much higher we
[00:36:56 - 00:36:58] have since looked at our
[00:36:58 - 00:37:00] revenue projections and gotten a
[00:37:00 - 00:37:00] better view of what the
[00:37:00 - 00:37:04] summer exemptions are which exemptions
[00:37:04 - 00:37:07] are a contra revenue account
[00:37:07 - 00:37:09] so we adjusted the tuition
[00:37:09 - 00:37:09] and fees we expect for
[00:37:09 - 00:37:13] this year down uh so
[00:37:13 - 00:37:15] that is a significant difference
[00:37:15 - 00:37:15] from what we reported june
[00:37:17 - 00:37:17] the 25th this is a
[00:37:17 - 00:37:19] more accurate prediction of where
[00:37:19 - 00:37:23] the revenues will be and
[00:37:23 - 00:37:23] so uh property taxes are
[00:37:23 - 00:37:32] coming that's a positive variance
[00:37:32 - 00:37:34] of 2 7 million approximately
[00:37:37 - 00:37:37] uh 3 65 uh 3
[00:37:38 - 00:37:41] 65 higher higher other other
[00:37:41 - 00:37:44] income is still trending higher
[00:37:44 - 00:37:44] that the large component of
[00:37:44 - 00:37:48] that is interest income so
[00:37:48 - 00:37:48] uh that is 4 8
[00:37:51 - 00:37:51] million higher it there's such
[00:37:51 - 00:37:54] a large variance because interest
[00:37:54 - 00:37:57] income is uh something that
[00:37:57 - 00:37:57] is hard to predict and
[00:37:58 - 00:37:59] uh very variable so we
[00:38:00 - 00:38:03] budget conservatively for interest income
[00:38:03 - 00:38:05] but interest rates have remained
[00:38:05 - 00:38:09] fairly high the fed has
[00:38:09 - 00:38:11] not changed rates yet but
[00:38:11 - 00:38:11] the world is very dynamic
[00:38:11 - 00:38:13] and that can happen very
[00:38:13 - 00:38:13] quickly so we do not
[00:38:17 - 00:38:17] rely on interest income as
[00:38:17 - 00:38:20] a stable revenue source but
[00:38:20 - 00:38:24] at the moment it's yielding
[00:38:24 - 00:38:24] a nice variance 4 8
[00:38:24 - 00:38:28] million uh dollars positive so
[00:38:28 - 00:38:28] we come down to the
[00:38:31 - 00:38:31] self-supporting line item it shows
[00:38:33 - 00:38:33] self-supporting shows a budget of
[00:38:33 - 00:38:36] 3 million and we have
[00:38:36 - 00:38:39] revenues predicted of 1 6
[00:38:39 - 00:38:39] million that shows a decrease
[00:38:39 - 00:38:42] on here but really because
[00:38:42 - 00:38:46] we're showing actual revenues to
[00:38:46 - 00:38:46] budget um it shows a
[00:38:48 - 00:38:50] decrease but the self-supporting accounts
[00:38:50 - 00:38:50] we do not spend more
[00:38:50 - 00:38:53] than the revenue that comes
[00:38:53 - 00:38:55] into them that's a very
[00:38:55 - 00:38:55] important aspect to keep in
[00:38:55 - 00:38:58] mind we are not going
[00:38:58 - 00:38:58] to go into any kind
[00:38:58 - 00:38:59] of deficit when it comes
[00:38:59 - 00:39:01] to self-supporting we only spend
[00:39:01 - 00:39:04] and monitor those accounts very
[00:39:04 - 00:39:08] closely in uh in that
[00:39:08 - 00:39:08] area so overall the way
[00:39:08 - 00:39:12] that revenues look they we
[00:39:12 - 00:39:17] have a uh increase of
[00:39:17 - 00:39:17] 11 9 million almost 12
[00:39:17 - 00:39:20] million over budgeted revenues yes
[00:39:20 - 00:39:23] sir just because i'm old
[00:39:23 - 00:39:26] and i forget things can
[00:39:26 - 00:39:26] you just couple examples of
[00:39:28 - 00:39:28] what self-supporting really is i
[00:39:28 - 00:39:32] mean what are those sure
[00:39:32 - 00:39:32] sure so uh many times
[00:39:32 - 00:39:34] the workforce area is very
[00:39:34 - 00:39:36] dynamic it wants to respond
[00:39:36 - 00:39:36] to industry demand to respond
[00:39:36 - 00:39:37] to industry demand okay okay
[00:39:39 - 00:39:39] so they want to pilot
[00:39:39 - 00:39:41] a program to see if
[00:39:41 - 00:39:41] it's viable and if it's
[00:39:41 - 00:39:43] viable uh the rules call
[00:39:43 - 00:39:46] for them mainstreaming that account
[00:39:46 - 00:39:48] into the operating budget okay
[00:39:48 - 00:39:50] i understand i'm just misconception
[00:39:50 - 00:39:50] when you say supporting misconception
[00:39:50 - 00:39:53] when you say supporting program
[00:39:53 - 00:39:55] program yes sir are there
[00:39:55 - 00:39:58] any other questions about this
[00:39:58 - 00:40:01] slide so the takeaway from
[00:40:01 - 00:40:06] here is when we look
[00:40:06 - 00:40:06] at um budgeted revenue is
[00:40:06 - 00:40:08] 166 5 million compared to
[00:40:08 - 00:40:10] what actually we predict is
[00:40:10 - 00:40:10] going to come in there's
[00:40:10 - 00:40:12] a positive variance of almost
[00:40:12 - 00:40:13] 12 million positive variance of
[00:40:14 - 00:40:15] almost 12 million 719 719
[00:40:15 - 00:40:25] 719 increase so looking at
[00:40:25 - 00:40:25] the current year as well
[00:40:29 - 00:40:29] how that's going to uh
[00:40:29 - 00:40:32] wind up this is our
[00:40:32 - 00:40:32] prediction for how operations are
[00:40:34 - 00:40:34] going to finish this year
[00:40:34 - 00:40:36] this particular slide incorporates revenues
[00:40:39 - 00:40:39] and our projected re expenditures
[00:40:42 - 00:40:42] so we see that we
[00:40:42 - 00:40:44] have brought forward we have
[00:40:44 - 00:40:47] brought forward the projected revenues
[00:40:47 - 00:40:51] of 178 5 million which
[00:40:51 - 00:40:51] is a positive variance of
[00:40:52 - 00:40:52] almost 12 million we saw
[00:40:52 - 00:40:55] that on the previous slide
[00:40:57 - 00:40:57] so now what we do
[00:40:57 - 00:40:59] over here we estimate expenditures
[00:40:59 - 00:41:02] and we estimate our expenditures
[00:41:02 - 00:41:02] to come in at 148
[00:41:02 - 00:41:03] 6 expenditures to come in
[00:41:04 - 00:41:04] at 148 6 million million
[00:41:07 - 00:41:07] resulting in a positive variance
[00:41:07 - 00:41:10] of 29 8 8 million
[00:41:10 - 00:41:10] for the year that's our
[00:41:13 - 00:41:13] prediction uh the surplus that
[00:41:13 - 00:41:17] is resulting from this uh
[00:41:17 - 00:41:19] helps to bolster fund balance
[00:41:19 - 00:41:19] which is looked on very
[00:41:23 - 00:41:23] positively by sac coc rating
[00:41:23 - 00:41:25] agencies and also allows us
[00:41:25 - 00:41:27] to continue the practice of
[00:41:27 - 00:41:30] supporting deferred maintenance projects in
[00:41:30 - 00:41:34] the plant funds so we
[00:41:34 - 00:41:34] have a lot of uh
[00:41:34 - 00:41:37] need in the area of
[00:41:37 - 00:41:37] maintaining buildings and grounds so
[00:41:39 - 00:41:39] forth so the college uh
[00:41:39 - 00:41:42] is very fortunate this year
[00:41:42 - 00:41:42] and and last year as
[00:41:45 - 00:41:45] well to contribute to addressing
[00:41:50 - 00:41:50] deferred maintenance needs um so
[00:41:50 - 00:41:55] this is a result of
[00:41:55 - 00:41:55] what we expect for for
[00:42:05 - 00:42:05] so looking forward towards next
[00:42:05 - 00:42:07] year's budget development this is
[00:42:07 - 00:42:11] a strategic plan for that
[00:42:11 - 00:42:11] so as a review planning
[00:42:13 - 00:42:13] for revenues the appropriation that
[00:42:15 - 00:42:15] we're going to talk about
[00:42:15 - 00:42:19] is a result of the
[00:42:19 - 00:42:19] 89th legislative session which i
[00:42:23 - 00:42:23] think is been extended dr
[00:42:27 - 00:42:27] and so uh a result
[00:42:27 - 00:42:29] also of the 88th legislature
[00:42:29 - 00:42:32] where the house bill historic
[00:42:32 - 00:42:32] house bill 8 uh was
[00:42:32 - 00:42:35] greatly impacted and so our
[00:42:35 - 00:42:38] revenues for the appropriation have
[00:42:38 - 00:42:40] changed greatly they are based
[00:42:40 - 00:42:43] upon performance measures and the
[00:42:43 - 00:42:43] payment methods that uh they
[00:42:43 - 00:42:45] have implemented are different from
[00:42:45 - 00:42:48] the past in the past
[00:42:48 - 00:42:48] we'd be funded on a
[00:42:48 - 00:42:50] bianium basis we get an
[00:42:50 - 00:42:53] appropriation we usually be good
[00:42:53 - 00:42:53] for two years so now
[00:42:55 - 00:42:55] that static model has changed
[00:42:55 - 00:42:58] to a more dynamic one
[00:42:58 - 00:42:58] it's based upon about 17
[00:43:02 - 00:43:02] different performance measures and so
[00:43:02 - 00:43:04] uh very different and also
[00:43:04 - 00:43:06] the payment system that they've
[00:43:06 - 00:43:08] implemented is different as well
[00:43:11 - 00:43:11] so that is the model
[00:43:11 - 00:43:13] that we're currently operating under
[00:43:13 - 00:43:14] tuition and currently operating under
[00:43:14 - 00:43:19] tuition and fees fees the
[00:43:19 - 00:43:19] tuition and fees um line
[00:43:19 - 00:43:22] item here we've we've uh
[00:43:22 - 00:43:25] reviewed our tuition and fees
[00:43:25 - 00:43:25] estimate and as i mentioned
[00:43:25 - 00:43:27] uh the tuition and fees
[00:43:27 - 00:43:29] from the current year largely
[00:43:29 - 00:43:29] go to predict what we're
[00:43:29 - 00:43:31] going to receive next year
[00:43:31 - 00:43:33] and we budget that way
[00:43:33 - 00:43:33] it's a very conservative way
[00:43:34 - 00:43:36] of budgeting what you're receiving
[00:43:36 - 00:43:38] now and then you budget
[00:43:38 - 00:43:38] that way expect that in
[00:43:41 - 00:43:41] the future so that is
[00:43:41 - 00:43:44] typically what we do but
[00:43:44 - 00:43:44] um what we also do
[00:43:44 - 00:43:47] we keep an eye on
[00:43:47 - 00:43:49] enrollment and as a result
[00:43:49 - 00:43:51] we've been looking almost every
[00:43:51 - 00:43:54] day at our enrollment numbers
[00:43:54 - 00:43:54] for the fall and that
[00:43:54 - 00:43:57] is trending lower our fall
[00:43:57 - 00:44:00] enrollment is showing some decreases
[00:44:00 - 00:44:00] and so we have to
[00:44:02 - 00:44:02] consider the risk of that
[00:44:02 - 00:44:05] into our budgeting so we
[00:44:05 - 00:44:09] have lowered our expectation for
[00:44:09 - 00:44:09] tuition and fees by 1
[00:44:09 - 00:44:13] 1 million as a result
[00:44:13 - 00:44:16] of what we're seeing for
[00:44:16 - 00:44:19] enrollment for this fall now
[00:44:19 - 00:44:19] that does not mean that
[00:44:19 - 00:44:20] that's the ultimate number we're
[00:44:20 - 00:44:23] going to use because as
[00:44:23 - 00:44:23] you know the budget is
[00:44:26 - 00:44:26] presented on august the 27th
[00:44:29 - 00:44:29] to the board for approval
[00:44:29 - 00:44:32] so between now and august
[00:44:32 - 00:44:35] 27th our enrollment may get
[00:44:35 - 00:44:35] better to the extent where
[00:44:35 - 00:44:38] we adjust our revenue estimates
[00:44:41 - 00:44:41] what is our past uh
[00:44:41 - 00:44:45] information show that it has
[00:44:45 - 00:44:47] increase between those those weeks
[00:44:47 - 00:44:47] the the past information shows
[00:44:50 - 00:44:50] that we had a slight
[00:44:50 - 00:44:52] increase at this point in
[00:44:52 - 00:44:52] time and at this point
[00:44:52 - 00:44:56] in time we have a
[00:44:56 - 00:44:58] very small decrease predicted but
[00:44:58 - 00:44:58] at this point in time
[00:44:58 - 00:45:02] last year we we show
[00:45:02 - 00:45:02] that we were we had
[00:45:02 - 00:45:09] a positive so right now
[00:45:09 - 00:45:09] it is not positive it
[00:45:09 - 00:45:12] is it is showing a
[00:45:12 - 00:45:15] negative number so we consider
[00:45:15 - 00:45:15] that as we develop our
[00:45:15 - 00:45:18] tuition and fees prediction and
[00:45:18 - 00:45:21] we'll continue to do that
[00:45:21 - 00:45:21] all the way up until
[00:45:21 - 00:45:23] we finalize and present a
[00:45:23 - 00:45:26] final budget for you so
[00:45:26 - 00:45:26] it may go up or
[00:45:26 - 00:45:28] if it needs to go
[00:45:28 - 00:45:28] down a little bit it'll
[00:45:28 - 00:45:31] be it'll be decreased as
[00:45:31 - 00:45:31] well the nice thing about
[00:45:33 - 00:45:33] um what the college has
[00:45:33 - 00:45:35] done historically to budget for
[00:45:35 - 00:45:37] this to mitigate that risk
[00:45:37 - 00:45:40] of enrollment declining the college
[00:45:40 - 00:45:46] maintains a bianium reserve that
[00:45:46 - 00:45:46] bianium reserve is meant for
[00:45:46 - 00:45:51] just such a situation we're
[00:45:51 - 00:45:51] currently flat judge um we're
[00:45:51 - 00:45:55] at 18810 right now we
[00:45:55 - 00:45:57] were at 18857 last year
[00:45:57 - 00:45:57] uh we've seen the enrollment
[00:46:00 - 00:46:00] process tighten as we've gotten
[00:46:00 - 00:46:04] closer to the fall semester
[00:46:04 - 00:46:06] um in um in contradiction
[00:46:06 - 00:46:06] with what we saw in
[00:46:06 - 00:46:08] the spring we saw a
[00:46:08 - 00:46:11] very healthy spring uh 5
[00:46:11 - 00:46:11] increase in the spring uh
[00:46:11 - 00:46:14] the summer was very healthy
[00:46:14 - 00:46:16] as well um significant increase
[00:46:16 - 00:46:16] this summer um all of
[00:46:16 - 00:46:18] those are indications that we
[00:46:18 - 00:46:23] expect to see a strong
[00:46:23 - 00:46:23] fall um but it is
[00:46:23 - 00:46:25] um weakening as we get
[00:46:25 - 00:46:25] closer and so i asked
[00:46:25 - 00:46:27] vice president flores to adjust
[00:46:27 - 00:46:29] the budget accordingly i didn't
[00:46:29 - 00:46:32] want there to be any
[00:46:32 - 00:46:32] surprises and so it's we're
[00:46:32 - 00:46:34] much more conservative with the
[00:46:34 - 00:46:37] budgeting process so i asked
[00:46:37 - 00:46:39] that he um adjust the
[00:46:39 - 00:46:39] budget and particularly tuition and
[00:46:42 - 00:46:42] fee revenue accordingly um i
[00:46:42 - 00:46:44] if anyone has specific questions
[00:46:44 - 00:46:48] i'd ask dr maya from
[00:46:48 - 00:46:48] his thing for dr maya
[00:46:48 - 00:46:50] to jump in just real
[00:46:50 - 00:46:52] quick you mentioned something about
[00:46:52 - 00:46:52] the the current session is
[00:46:52 - 00:46:57] there any realistic or expectation
[00:46:57 - 00:47:00] or current special sessions but
[00:47:00 - 00:47:03] does that really set the
[00:47:03 - 00:47:05] special session with other things
[00:47:05 - 00:47:05] so the special session it's
[00:47:05 - 00:47:07] a great question structure lots
[00:47:07 - 00:47:09] of different items on special
[00:47:09 - 00:47:11] session which essentially we know
[00:47:11 - 00:47:14] there are many of our
[00:47:14 - 00:47:14] legislators not in austin and
[00:47:14 - 00:47:15] so we'll see what ends
[00:47:15 - 00:47:17] up happening i would imagine
[00:47:17 - 00:47:17] the governor will call a
[00:47:19 - 00:47:19] second special session and potentially
[00:47:22 - 00:47:22] more so um the maps
[00:47:22 - 00:47:24] have come to completion there
[00:47:24 - 00:47:24] is an item on the
[00:47:27 - 00:47:27] special agenda that pertains to
[00:47:27 - 00:47:29] us specifically and it is
[00:47:29 - 00:47:31] tax rate um now that
[00:47:31 - 00:47:31] won't affect this current year's
[00:47:33 - 00:47:33] budget but that could affect
[00:47:33 - 00:47:36] the college budget going forward
[00:47:38 - 00:47:38] um i don't know if
[00:47:38 - 00:47:38] you have any judge or
[00:47:40 - 00:47:40] any other member has any
[00:47:40 - 00:47:43] other questions on enrollment um
[00:47:43 - 00:47:45] again we're continuing to run
[00:47:45 - 00:47:45] enrollment and we will run
[00:47:48 - 00:47:48] enrollment through um the first
[00:47:48 - 00:47:52] week of class uh we
[00:47:52 - 00:47:54] allow some uh schedule adjustments
[00:47:54 - 00:47:55] and then obviously dual credit
[00:47:55 - 00:47:56] early college high school will
[00:47:57 - 00:47:57] continue to work with our
[00:47:57 - 00:48:00] district partners um all the
[00:48:00 - 00:48:02] way up until census date
[00:48:02 - 00:48:02] and actually i remind the
[00:48:02 - 00:48:06] board that we have um
[00:48:06 - 00:48:07] many throughout so even on
[00:48:07 - 00:48:07] census date when we reported
[00:48:09 - 00:48:09] enrollment that's not the final
[00:48:11 - 00:48:11] enrollment because we have many
[00:48:11 - 00:48:16] that go out throughout the
[00:48:16 - 00:48:18] fall term please sure uh
[00:48:18 - 00:48:20] so point time is so
[00:48:20 - 00:48:20] as i mentioned we're basically
[00:48:20 - 00:48:24] flat with 47 students down
[00:48:24 - 00:48:27] from last semester at the
[00:48:27 - 00:48:27] same date uh classes start
[00:48:29 - 00:48:31] august 25th we have several
[00:48:31 - 00:48:33] campaigns going on right now
[00:48:33 - 00:48:33] where we are reaching out
[00:48:33 - 00:48:37] to students who have uh
[00:48:37 - 00:48:40] enrolled haven't completed their fa
[00:48:40 - 00:48:43] or need to complete their
[00:48:43 - 00:48:43] fa so we have internal
[00:48:46 - 00:48:48] campaigns going on trellis is
[00:48:48 - 00:48:48] one of our partners as
[00:48:48 - 00:48:50] well they're assisting us with
[00:48:50 - 00:48:52] those students needing assistance with
[00:48:52 - 00:48:54] financial aid so we continue
[00:48:54 - 00:48:54] to ask students also as
[00:48:57 - 00:48:57] dr sa mentioned through dual
[00:48:57 - 00:48:58] credit early college high school
[00:48:58 - 00:49:01] enrollment because we still receive
[00:49:01 - 00:49:04] those rosters from our isd
[00:49:04 - 00:49:04] partners so we are working
[00:49:06 - 00:49:06] to get our enrollment keep
[00:49:06 - 00:49:10] our enrollment up and also
[00:49:10 - 00:49:12] uh wherever we end up
[00:49:12 - 00:49:12] today the really important number
[00:49:14 - 00:49:14] is where we end up
[00:49:14 - 00:49:17] at census date which is
[00:49:17 - 00:49:17] september 10 so we work
[00:49:17 - 00:49:21] really hard to get our
[00:49:21 - 00:49:24] students enrolled and sorry yeah
[00:49:24 - 00:49:24] uh we work hard to
[00:49:24 - 00:49:29] get our students enrolled and
[00:49:29 - 00:49:32] paid uh by the by
[00:49:32 - 00:49:32] census date so we try
[00:49:32 - 00:49:33] to reduce the number of
[00:49:33 - 00:49:33] students that we end up
[00:49:33 - 00:49:38] having to drop for a
[00:49:38 - 00:49:41] non-payment um so lots of
[00:49:41 - 00:49:45] campaigns going on and uh
[00:49:45 - 00:49:45] we still have extended hours
[00:49:45 - 00:49:50] uh coming up this saturday
[00:49:50 - 00:49:53] uh august 16th 10 00
[00:49:53 - 00:49:53] a m to 2 00
[00:49:53 - 00:49:56] p m august 23rd 10
[00:49:56 - 00:49:56] 00 a m to 2
[00:49:56 - 00:49:56] 00 p m as well
[00:49:56 - 00:49:59] as extended hours the week
[00:49:59 - 00:50:02] before classes start and the
[00:50:02 - 00:50:04] first two days of enrollment
[00:50:04 - 00:50:04] as dr sata mentioned this
[00:50:07 - 00:50:07] will allow students to enroll
[00:50:07 - 00:50:10] as long as a class
[00:50:10 - 00:50:10] hasn't met or via a
[00:50:10 - 00:50:14] petition through a dean have
[00:50:14 - 00:50:14] we done any analysis on
[00:50:14 - 00:50:18] um how many students are
[00:50:18 - 00:50:18] not returning or how many
[00:50:21 - 00:50:21] we expected to return but
[00:50:21 - 00:50:25] are not um i can
[00:50:25 - 00:50:25] look at we do see
[00:50:25 - 00:50:27] what our uh continuing student
[00:50:27 - 00:50:30] enrollment looks like so we
[00:50:30 - 00:50:32] all summer long we're looking
[00:50:32 - 00:50:32] very healthy it's been the
[00:50:32 - 00:50:34] past couple of weeks that
[00:50:34 - 00:50:36] we've seen this slowdown and
[00:50:36 - 00:50:36] one of the markers that
[00:50:36 - 00:50:39] we do look at is
[00:50:39 - 00:50:41] our continuing students so that's
[00:50:41 - 00:50:41] where we've seen a little
[00:50:41 - 00:50:44] bit of decline so uh
[00:50:44 - 00:50:48] there are there are captive
[00:50:48 - 00:50:48] audience so we're reaching out
[00:50:49 - 00:50:49] to those students as well
[00:50:49 - 00:50:50] if they to those students
[00:50:50 - 00:50:51] as well if they enrolled
[00:50:51 - 00:50:53] enrolled haven't graduated enrolled in
[00:50:53 - 00:50:55] spring or summer and not
[00:50:55 - 00:51:13] enrolled in fall we're so
[00:51:13 - 00:51:13] we're going to continue looking
[00:51:13 - 00:51:16] at tuition and fees and
[00:51:16 - 00:51:18] adjust accordingly up until we
[00:51:18 - 00:51:18] present you a final budget
[00:51:21 - 00:51:24] on august the 27th the
[00:51:24 - 00:51:24] next item are property taxes
[00:51:24 - 00:51:26] this is a number that
[00:51:26 - 00:51:29] has been finalized in the
[00:51:29 - 00:51:29] budget on july the 25th
[00:51:29 - 00:51:32] we received the certified valuations
[00:51:35 - 00:51:35] uh from the cad and
[00:51:35 - 00:51:39] our valuations went up about
[00:51:39 - 00:51:41] 4 6 billion to 73
[00:51:41 - 00:51:43] 46 to 73 46 billion
[00:51:43 - 00:51:46] billion uh and also we
[00:51:46 - 00:51:49] had new property valued at
[00:51:49 - 00:51:53] 1 5 billion and resulting
[00:51:53 - 00:51:53] in a no new revenue
[00:51:53 - 00:51:58] rate of 10 3563 cents
[00:51:58 - 00:51:58] per 100 valuation that is
[00:51:58 - 00:52:03] down from 10 77 almost
[00:52:03 - 00:52:03] half a penny down so
[00:52:07 - 00:52:07] that is driving our ability
[00:52:07 - 00:52:09] uh to raise tax revenue
[00:52:09 - 00:52:09] should the college ever need
[00:52:12 - 00:52:12] that uh as a reminder
[00:52:12 - 00:52:15] we are capped at 15
[00:52:15 - 00:52:15] cents per 100 valuation so
[00:52:19 - 00:52:19] anything driving our rate lower
[00:52:19 - 00:52:23] is uh good for the
[00:52:23 - 00:52:24] future should it be needed
[00:52:25 - 00:52:25] now planning for additional funding
[00:52:28 - 00:52:28] request um today one of
[00:52:28 - 00:52:31] the items on the agenda
[00:52:31 - 00:52:32] is consideration of a salary
[00:52:35 - 00:52:35] increase so the presentation before
[00:52:38 - 00:52:38] that on the budget uh
[00:52:38 - 00:52:41] is to inform what the
[00:52:41 - 00:52:41] capacity is for the district
[00:52:41 - 00:52:44] to fund a salary increase
[00:52:46 - 00:52:46] and also additional funding requests
[00:52:48 - 00:52:48] that have been presented by
[00:52:48 - 00:52:50] the executive levels that you're
[00:52:50 - 00:52:52] going to see in just
[00:52:52 - 00:52:52] a little bit at this
[00:52:52 - 00:52:54] point in time uh what
[00:52:54 - 00:52:57] has changed from june the
[00:52:57 - 00:53:00] 25th is that dr has
[00:53:00 - 00:53:00] had a chance to vet
[00:53:00 - 00:53:04] the additional request and uh
[00:53:04 - 00:53:04] dropped them by close to
[00:53:07 - 00:53:07] half a million dollars so
[00:53:07 - 00:53:10] it is a significant decrease
[00:53:12 - 00:53:12] and so um there is
[00:53:12 - 00:53:16] going to be continued impact
[00:53:16 - 00:53:16] from the gazsby 68 and
[00:53:16 - 00:53:19] 75 on unrestricted net position
[00:53:19 - 00:53:22] that is a very variable
[00:53:22 - 00:53:22] amount we depend on the
[00:53:23 - 00:53:23] information from the state which
[00:53:23 - 00:53:25] we do not have yet
[00:53:25 - 00:53:28] but still it's something that
[00:53:28 - 00:53:28] needs to be considered it
[00:53:28 - 00:53:30] averages about 4 million impact
[00:53:30 - 00:53:33] to our fund balance every
[00:53:33 - 00:53:33] year and so an additional
[00:53:37 - 00:53:37] gazsby that um anna and
[00:53:37 - 00:53:39] her team are working on
[00:53:39 - 00:53:40] in accounting is gazby 101
[00:53:42 - 00:53:42] compensated absences these are things
[00:53:44 - 00:53:44] that we are mandated to
[00:53:44 - 00:53:46] follow by the governmental accounting
[00:53:46 - 00:53:49] standards board otherwise we would
[00:53:49 - 00:53:51] get an unmodifi we would
[00:53:51 - 00:53:51] not get an unmodified opinion
[00:53:52 - 00:53:54] and the uh financial statements
[00:53:54 - 00:53:57] that the college produces are
[00:53:57 - 00:54:00] super important to receive the
[00:54:00 - 00:54:00] appropriation to get pel and
[00:54:03 - 00:54:03] are viewed by many granting
[00:54:03 - 00:54:05] agencies so a very important
[00:54:05 - 00:54:06] document to the a very
[00:54:06 - 00:54:08] important document to the district
[00:54:11 - 00:54:11] so looking at our uh
[00:54:11 - 00:54:13] performance tier this is our
[00:54:13 - 00:54:16] appropriation this is not changed
[00:54:16 - 00:54:16] from the june 25th presentation
[00:54:19 - 00:54:19] um uh looking at the
[00:54:19 - 00:54:21] terminology near final this is
[00:54:21 - 00:54:24] a terminology from the coordinating
[00:54:24 - 00:54:24] board so that implies that
[00:54:26 - 00:54:26] there might be some changes
[00:54:26 - 00:54:29] to that so but that's
[00:54:29 - 00:54:29] the best number that we
[00:54:29 - 00:54:31] have for appropriation i will
[00:54:31 - 00:54:35] tell you that that 43
[00:54:35 - 00:54:35] 9 million is a projection
[00:54:35 - 00:54:37] by the coordinating board on
[00:54:37 - 00:54:41] what we're going to earn
[00:54:41 - 00:54:41] as appropriation once we report
[00:54:44 - 00:54:44] our actual enrollment numbers to
[00:54:44 - 00:54:46] the coordinating board it will
[00:54:46 - 00:54:49] be different from that but
[00:54:49 - 00:54:49] we don't know by how
[00:54:49 - 00:54:50] from that but we don't
[00:54:50 - 00:54:50] know by how much much
[00:54:54 - 00:54:54] so uh that number will
[00:54:54 - 00:54:55] change either a little bit
[00:54:55 - 00:54:55] or a lot we don't
[00:54:55 - 00:54:58] know at this point it's
[00:54:58 - 00:54:58] the best number that we
[00:55:01 - 00:55:03] have so far and so
[00:55:03 - 00:55:03] that's the cr some of
[00:55:03 - 00:55:06] the criteria that now go
[00:55:06 - 00:55:06] into the criteria that now
[00:55:07 - 00:55:08] go into the appropriation appropriation
[00:55:11 - 00:55:11] uh that is very different
[00:55:11 - 00:55:13] from the bienium funding that
[00:55:13 - 00:55:22] we used to receive so
[00:55:22 - 00:55:22] house bill 8 also changed
[00:55:22 - 00:55:24] the way we receive that
[00:55:24 - 00:55:27] particular appropriation and any future
[00:55:27 - 00:55:33] appropriations in coming years so
[00:55:33 - 00:55:33] we just have to um
[00:55:33 - 00:55:35] uh be aware of how
[00:55:35 - 00:55:37] the funding for appropriation comes
[00:55:37 - 00:55:37] in it comes in in
[00:55:37 - 00:55:39] three installments now which is
[00:55:39 - 00:55:41] different from the past used
[00:55:41 - 00:55:41] to come in in 10
[00:55:44 - 00:55:44] installments uh so the the
[00:55:44 - 00:55:46] state has changed not only
[00:55:46 - 00:55:48] the performance measures but how
[00:55:48 - 00:55:58] they distribute the other state
[00:55:58 - 00:56:01] funding the financial aid for
[00:56:01 - 00:56:06] swift transfer fast is budgeted
[00:56:06 - 00:56:06] at 5 6 million so
[00:56:06 - 00:56:08] that has gone up 175
[00:56:08 - 00:56:11] 000 from the presentation on
[00:56:11 - 00:56:13] june the 25th the reason
[00:56:13 - 00:56:13] that that has gone up
[00:56:13 - 00:56:15] is because now we have
[00:56:15 - 00:56:19] received the uh allocation for
[00:56:19 - 00:56:19] the fall of 2024 we
[00:56:20 - 00:56:22] know what that amount is
[00:56:22 - 00:56:24] and then also we num
[00:56:24 - 00:56:24] we know what the numbers
[00:56:24 - 00:56:27] that were reported for the
[00:56:27 - 00:56:29] spring so since miss zuniga
[00:56:29 - 00:56:29] had that information she was
[00:56:30 - 00:56:32] up to able to update
[00:56:32 - 00:56:37] her revenue projection for the
[00:56:37 - 00:56:37] fast also um keep in
[00:56:37 - 00:56:39] mind that the state increased
[00:56:39 - 00:56:39] the funding from the state
[00:56:39 - 00:56:40] increased the funding from 56
[00:56:41 - 00:56:44] 87 56 87 cents per
[00:56:44 - 00:56:44] per semester credit hour to
[00:56:44 - 00:56:45] cents per per semester credit
[00:56:45 - 00:56:46] hour to 58 52 58
[00:56:46 - 00:56:49] 52 cents per semester credit
[00:56:49 - 00:56:52] hour as far as benefits
[00:56:52 - 00:56:55] are concerned um for the
[00:56:55 - 00:56:55] first time in several years
[00:56:55 - 00:56:58] the state has raised uh
[00:56:58 - 00:57:00] the premium rates for health
[00:57:00 - 00:57:02] insurance they raised them by
[00:57:02 - 00:57:06] 8 and so um the
[00:57:06 - 00:57:09] state currently funds our health
[00:57:09 - 00:57:09] insurance at about close to
[00:57:09 - 00:57:11] 50 they don't provide us
[00:57:11 - 00:57:13] funding for physical plant personnel
[00:57:13 - 00:57:16] however we have to uh
[00:57:16 - 00:57:16] budget for that and the
[00:57:18 - 00:57:18] grants uh pay for their
[00:57:18 - 00:57:21] own health insurance benefits however
[00:57:21 - 00:57:25] um due to the 8
[00:57:25 - 00:57:25] increase uh that is going
[00:57:25 - 00:57:28] to result in a must
[00:57:28 - 00:57:29] be funded or critical item
[00:57:29 - 00:57:29] that you're going to see
[00:57:29 - 00:57:33] on the additional funding request
[00:57:33 - 00:57:35] of 74 000 you're going
[00:57:35 - 00:57:35] to see in a little
[00:57:35 - 00:57:38] while the reason is the
[00:57:38 - 00:57:42] state increased our rate by
[00:57:42 - 00:57:42] 8 we incur close to
[00:57:42 - 00:57:46] 7 7 million of u
[00:57:46 - 00:57:50] health insurance costs that we
[00:57:50 - 00:57:50] fund and so uh you
[00:57:50 - 00:57:53] can do the extension on
[00:57:53 - 00:57:53] that uh there's no change
[00:58:04 - 00:58:04] so just as a reminder
[00:58:04 - 00:58:06] last presentation we talked about
[00:58:06 - 00:58:09] the change in the purchasing
[00:58:09 - 00:58:13] uh mandatory bidding requirement from
[00:58:13 - 00:58:15] 50 to 100 000 and
[00:58:15 - 00:58:15] uh the board discussed this
[00:58:19 - 00:58:19] particular item and uh agreed
[00:58:19 - 00:58:22] that for the next coming
[00:58:22 - 00:58:25] fiscal year the board would
[00:58:25 - 00:58:25] also like to see uh
[00:58:25 - 00:58:27] competitive processes that are done
[00:58:27 - 00:58:29] for anything valued at 100
[00:58:29 - 00:58:29] 000 or more the college
[00:58:33 - 00:58:33] is working to update its
[00:58:33 - 00:58:35] uh procedures or purchasing procedures
[00:58:35 - 00:58:36] with regard to this and
[00:58:36 - 00:58:36] you'll see that in the
[00:58:36 - 00:58:37] august this and you'll see
[00:58:38 - 00:58:39] that in the august 27th
[00:58:41 - 00:58:43] board meeting so now we
[00:58:43 - 00:58:43] look at the projection for
[00:58:46 - 00:58:48] revenues for 2526 so as
[00:58:48 - 00:58:48] i mentioned the current year
[00:58:48 - 00:58:51] is the basis for projections
[00:58:51 - 00:58:54] going into the future and
[00:58:54 - 00:58:54] largely that's what this future
[00:58:54 - 00:58:55] and largely that's what this
[00:58:55 - 00:58:58] represents represents uh on the
[00:58:58 - 00:59:02] state appropriations line we show
[00:59:02 - 00:59:04] an uh increase to the
[00:59:04 - 00:59:09] appropriation compared to the current
[00:59:09 - 00:59:09] year um that is a
[00:59:09 - 00:59:11] result of the college performing
[00:59:11 - 00:59:13] better on its performing on
[00:59:13 - 00:59:17] its performance measures that were
[00:59:17 - 00:59:17] reported last year last year
[00:59:19 - 00:59:19] uh the college received a
[00:59:19 - 00:59:22] 4 7 million dynamic adjustment
[00:59:24 - 00:59:24] over what the coordinated board
[00:59:24 - 00:59:27] had predicted for us that
[00:59:27 - 00:59:29] was a very positive result
[00:59:29 - 00:59:32] for the year this appropriation
[00:59:32 - 00:59:36] increase largely reflects that and
[00:59:36 - 00:59:36] also the increase in the
[00:59:36 - 00:59:40] fast funding rate from 56
[00:59:40 - 00:59:42] to 58 per semester credit
[00:59:42 - 00:59:46] hours um overhead recovery we
[00:59:46 - 00:59:48] predict a small decrease of
[00:59:48 - 00:59:52] 84 000 there um on
[00:59:52 - 00:59:56] the local funds tuition and
[00:59:56 - 00:59:56] fees we have a small
[00:59:56 - 00:59:58] decrease predicted there we are
[00:59:58 - 01:00:01] continuing to look at this
[01:00:01 - 01:00:01] item this is item we
[01:00:02 - 01:00:02] talked about we're looking at
[01:00:02 - 01:00:04] the fall enrollment and we
[01:00:04 - 01:00:06] will adjust accordingly leading up
[01:00:06 - 01:00:09] to the final budget presentation
[01:00:09 - 01:00:11] either up or down we're
[01:00:11 - 01:00:11] going to adjust it the
[01:00:11 - 01:00:13] idea is to produce a
[01:00:13 - 01:00:13] sustainable budget and that is
[01:00:16 - 01:00:21] our key objective um and
[01:00:21 - 01:00:21] so property tax property taxes
[01:00:22 - 01:00:22] now that we have the
[01:00:22 - 01:00:25] certified valuations and the no
[01:00:25 - 01:00:28] new revenue rate we predict
[01:00:28 - 01:00:28] that we're going to receive
[01:00:33 - 01:00:33] at least 75 2 million
[01:00:33 - 01:00:35] in property tax revenue uh
[01:00:35 - 01:00:35] the property tax revenues we
[01:00:38 - 01:00:41] budget very conservative conservatively for
[01:00:41 - 01:00:41] those uh the big the
[01:00:41 - 01:00:45] big thing on that is
[01:00:45 - 01:00:45] that the certified values that
[01:00:48 - 01:00:48] the cad provides the taxing
[01:00:48 - 01:00:51] entities are discounted about 2
[01:00:52 - 01:00:53] 8 so when the college
[01:00:53 - 01:00:56] receives those values they're lower
[01:00:56 - 01:00:59] by 2 8 because they
[01:00:59 - 01:00:59] are they are predicting what
[01:01:02 - 01:01:02] refunds and lawsuits may result
[01:01:02 - 01:01:05] in so the the government
[01:01:05 - 01:01:07] agencies like that because it
[01:01:07 - 01:01:09] results in a more conservative
[01:01:09 - 01:01:09] budget just in case you
[01:01:12 - 01:01:12] have a large refund or
[01:01:12 - 01:01:15] large lawsuit that may happen
[01:01:15 - 01:01:17] so our property tax revenue
[01:01:17 - 01:01:17] is based upon a certified
[01:01:17 - 01:01:21] rate 2 8 lower however
[01:01:21 - 01:01:24] when uh property tax owners
[01:01:24 - 01:01:27] are mailed their statements those
[01:01:27 - 01:01:27] do not contain that discount
[01:01:30 - 01:01:30] so generally we receive more
[01:01:30 - 01:01:33] revenue than what we budget
[01:01:33 - 01:01:36] because the cad is very
[01:01:36 - 01:01:36] good at resolving those protests
[01:01:40 - 01:01:40] um and so the the
[01:01:40 - 01:01:43] cad the the city collects
[01:01:43 - 01:01:43] uh 100 of the valuation
[01:01:43 - 01:01:45] that they mailed out but
[01:01:45 - 01:01:47] we budget conservatively and in
[01:01:47 - 01:01:59] doing so we're major increase
[01:01:59 - 01:02:01] other income we continue to
[01:02:01 - 01:02:05] budget interest income very conservatively
[01:02:05 - 01:02:05] at 5 million um as
[01:02:05 - 01:02:06] i said interest income is
[01:02:06 - 01:02:08] something that's unpredictable not something
[01:02:08 - 01:02:11] that's sustainable so we don't
[01:02:11 - 01:02:14] build our budget on that
[01:02:14 - 01:02:14] we failed 5 million is
[01:02:17 - 01:02:17] very achievable even if the
[01:02:17 - 01:02:19] fed cutting rates uh by
[01:02:19 - 01:02:20] more than half we would
[01:02:23 - 01:02:23] still be able to support
[01:02:23 - 01:02:25] our budget and the future
[01:02:25 - 01:02:25] does not predict that kind
[01:02:25 - 01:02:28] of uh decline in rates
[01:02:28 - 01:02:32] so we feel confident about
[01:02:32 - 01:02:38] what we budgeted for so
[01:02:38 - 01:02:38] we we see um overall
[01:02:38 - 01:02:43] the take the takeaway here
[01:02:43 - 01:02:43] is this 173 9 million
[01:02:43 - 01:02:46] is our total projected revenues
[01:02:49 - 01:02:49] uh for next year we
[01:02:49 - 01:02:52] cannot exceed that as we
[01:02:52 - 01:02:52] develop a budget so that's
[01:02:52 - 01:02:56] our uh line in the
[01:02:56 - 01:02:56] sand uh it's an increase
[01:02:56 - 01:03:00] of of 7 4 4
[01:03:00 - 01:03:12] million over budgeted revenues so
[01:03:12 - 01:03:12] how do those budgeted revenues
[01:03:12 - 01:03:14] what how do they look
[01:03:14 - 01:03:14] like in terms of source
[01:03:17 - 01:03:17] of funding property taxes continue
[01:03:17 - 01:03:21] to be the largest revenue
[01:03:21 - 01:03:24] source at 43 27 75
[01:03:24 - 01:03:24] 2 2 million followed by
[01:03:28 - 01:03:28] appropriations almost 50 million tuition
[01:03:31 - 01:03:31] and fees those are the
[01:03:31 - 01:03:34] three uh largest revenue sources
[01:03:34 - 01:03:34] and then we have other
[01:03:36 - 01:03:39] income self-supporting and overhead recovery
[01:03:39 - 01:03:39] so this is showing the
[01:03:43 - 01:03:43] previous slide uh by percentage
[01:03:43 - 01:03:49] of revenue source and so
[01:03:49 - 01:03:49] we get to the baseline
[01:03:49 - 01:03:50] budget this is a result
[01:03:50 - 01:03:53] of all the budget submissions
[01:03:53 - 01:03:53] by the executive levels all
[01:03:55 - 01:03:55] the vice presidents and associate
[01:03:55 - 01:03:58] vice presidents so the budget
[01:03:58 - 01:04:00] office works to compile all
[01:04:00 - 01:04:03] of these budgets review them
[01:04:03 - 01:04:03] and so those budget submissions
[01:04:06 - 01:04:06] also uh include additional requests
[01:04:06 - 01:04:08] that we're going to talk
[01:04:08 - 01:04:10] about in a little bit
[01:04:10 - 01:04:10] but this is the baseline
[01:04:10 - 01:04:13] budget this is nothing above
[01:04:13 - 01:04:15] what they had the year
[01:04:15 - 01:04:18] before so u the baseline
[01:04:18 - 01:04:22] budget shows a decrease of
[01:04:22 - 01:04:22] uh 1 million that reflects
[01:04:24 - 01:04:24] the movement of positions people
[01:04:24 - 01:04:26] leaving the college at a
[01:04:26 - 01:04:28] high salary and then the
[01:04:28 - 01:04:28] recruit the people recruited coming
[01:04:32 - 01:04:32] in at the lower salary
[01:04:32 - 01:04:36] so that largely is the
[01:04:36 - 01:04:36] result of that so you
[01:04:36 - 01:04:39] see an increase in the
[01:04:39 - 01:04:43] baseline budget from 2425 2526
[01:04:43 - 01:04:43] which is the middle column
[01:04:43 - 01:04:43] 2425 2526 which is the
[01:04:43 - 01:04:50] middle column continue continue and
[01:04:50 - 01:04:50] so the other section in
[01:04:50 - 01:04:54] here is the self-supporting area
[01:04:54 - 01:04:56] and they always budget at
[01:04:56 - 01:04:56] break even they cannot exceed
[01:04:59 - 01:04:59] what they have budgeted for
[01:04:59 - 01:05:02] so that is budgeted at
[01:05:02 - 01:05:02] break even no effect on
[01:05:02 - 01:05:05] the baseline budget so then
[01:05:05 - 01:05:06] this baseline baseline budget so
[01:05:07 - 01:05:11] then this baseline budget reflected
[01:05:11 - 01:05:11] by functional area would be
[01:05:16 - 01:05:16] distributed like this uh so
[01:05:16 - 01:05:18] dr smith is still in
[01:05:18 - 01:05:18] the range here at 54
[01:05:18 - 01:05:23] 7 million uh 33 11
[01:05:23 - 01:05:27] of the budget and then
[01:05:27 - 01:05:27] uh followed by support at
[01:05:27 - 01:05:31] almost 50 million 30 academic
[01:05:31 - 01:05:33] support which also belongs to
[01:05:33 - 01:05:37] dr uh 20 3 million
[01:05:37 - 01:05:41] 12 28 and operations and
[01:05:41 - 01:05:44] and maintenance physical plant 13
[01:05:44 - 01:05:47] million student services 12 7
[01:05:50 - 01:05:53] transfers 3 5 public service
[01:05:53 - 01:05:56] 3 83 and research at
[01:05:56 - 01:05:59] 214 000 so this is
[01:05:59 - 01:05:59] the way that the baseline
[01:06:03 - 01:06:03] budget is allocated by functional
[01:06:03 - 01:06:05] area so you see the
[01:06:05 - 01:06:08] same baseline budget distributed by
[01:06:08 - 01:06:12] expense categories so in here
[01:06:12 - 01:06:12] uh the largest category is
[01:06:12 - 01:06:15] uh faculty salaries of 34
[01:06:15 - 01:06:18] 13 and then you can
[01:06:18 - 01:06:18] see in the block here
[01:06:20 - 01:06:20] how that details out between
[01:06:20 - 01:06:23] full-time and part-time faculty and
[01:06:23 - 01:06:25] then over here staff salaries
[01:06:25 - 01:06:28] close to 50 million you
[01:06:28 - 01:06:28] see the detail between full-time
[01:06:28 - 01:06:31] and part-time over here and
[01:06:31 - 01:06:33] overtime and then followed by
[01:06:33 - 01:06:38] supplies and services 28 million
[01:06:38 - 01:06:38] 17 of the budget benefits
[01:06:38 - 01:06:42] 14 million transfer 7 5
[01:06:42 - 01:06:47] contingency 6 5 travel 1
[01:06:47 - 01:06:53] 3 equipment 1 1 so
[01:06:53 - 01:06:53] this is how the expenses
[01:06:53 - 01:06:55] break out um for the
[01:06:55 - 01:06:58] baseline budget the interesting thing
[01:06:58 - 01:06:58] here if you add faculty
[01:06:58 - 01:07:01] salaries staff salaries and benefits
[01:07:01 - 01:07:11] you get real quick some
[01:07:11 - 01:07:11] time ago there was a
[01:07:14 - 01:07:14] question about having enough parttime
[01:07:15 - 01:07:16] split between part-time and full-time
[01:07:17 - 01:07:20] faculty i think is there
[01:07:20 - 01:07:20] any question about them do
[01:07:20 - 01:07:28] we evaluations are we still
[01:07:28 - 01:07:30] okay there we we are
[01:07:30 - 01:07:30] to date mr xer so
[01:07:30 - 01:07:34] what mr xer is referencing
[01:07:34 - 01:07:34] is um gosh um 12
[01:07:37 - 01:07:37] years ago um we had
[01:07:37 - 01:07:40] a sachs on-site visit our
[01:07:40 - 01:07:42] accrediting agency sacl um southern
[01:07:42 - 01:07:45] association of colleges and schools
[01:07:45 - 01:07:45] commission on colleges did a
[01:07:47 - 01:07:47] visit and they broke down
[01:07:47 - 01:07:50] our our faculty ratios in
[01:07:50 - 01:07:52] a different manner than they
[01:07:52 - 01:07:52] had ever done before we're
[01:07:55 - 01:07:55] one accreditation one college five
[01:07:58 - 01:07:58] campuses six sites total and
[01:07:58 - 01:07:59] what they did this is
[01:07:59 - 01:07:59] more in particular for you
[01:08:01 - 01:08:01] is they came in and
[01:08:01 - 01:08:03] they said they looked at
[01:08:03 - 01:08:04] every single program on every
[01:08:06 - 01:08:06] single campus and deemed that
[01:08:06 - 01:08:08] we had to have full-time
[01:08:08 - 01:08:08] faculty at each of those
[01:08:13 - 01:08:13] programs and um and campuses
[01:08:13 - 01:08:16] um that caused the institution
[01:08:16 - 01:08:19] we were put on uh
[01:08:19 - 01:08:19] we had to raise taxes
[01:08:19 - 01:08:22] and hire 55 additional full-time
[01:08:22 - 01:08:24] faculty the course of the
[01:08:24 - 01:08:24] year um prior to that
[01:08:24 - 01:08:27] they looked at us as
[01:08:27 - 01:08:30] a district and we covered
[01:08:30 - 01:08:32] between 47 and 52 full-time
[01:08:32 - 01:08:32] faculty in any one of
[01:08:32 - 01:08:34] those given terms during that
[01:08:34 - 01:08:36] the the five years preceding
[01:08:36 - 01:08:36] when they came we were
[01:08:38 - 01:08:40] just under 48 we turn
[01:08:40 - 01:08:40] around we hired those full-time
[01:08:42 - 01:08:42] faculty dr smith and his
[01:08:42 - 01:08:44] team did a tremendous job
[01:08:44 - 01:08:46] of hiring again 55 additional
[01:08:46 - 01:08:48] full-time faculty uh we were
[01:08:48 - 01:08:48] taken off morning the following
[01:08:51 - 01:08:51] summer uh and at one
[01:08:51 - 01:08:54] point i i believe that
[01:08:54 - 01:08:54] we had um 72 of
[01:08:54 - 01:08:57] our sections taught by full-time
[01:08:57 - 01:08:59] faculty despite the ratio so
[01:08:59 - 01:08:59] you see that the full-time
[01:09:00 - 01:09:00] faculty salaries are just over
[01:09:00 - 01:09:03] the part-time faculty but our
[01:09:03 - 01:09:05] full-time faculty teaches the bulk
[01:09:05 - 01:09:13] of the courses the last
[01:09:13 - 01:09:13] time i saw was 72
[01:09:13 - 01:09:15] i'm not sure where we
[01:09:15 - 01:09:15] are now yeah i think
[01:09:20 - 01:09:20] we're down around uh 68
[01:09:20 - 01:09:22] uh currently uh every position
[01:09:22 - 01:09:25] that becomes available or is
[01:09:25 - 01:09:25] requested for faculty uh gets
[01:09:27 - 01:09:27] discussed at leadership um for
[01:09:30 - 01:09:30] instructional deans and edps uh
[01:09:30 - 01:09:32] talk about every single position
[01:09:32 - 01:09:34] we look at the ratios
[01:09:34 - 01:09:34] that uh are being referred
[01:09:34 - 01:09:36] to across the district before
[01:09:36 - 01:09:39] we make a determination on
[01:09:39 - 01:09:43] the point we don't have
[01:09:43 - 01:09:43] any we're not concerned about
[01:09:45 - 01:09:45] great question structure bringing me
[01:09:47 - 01:09:47] back to the actual question
[01:09:47 - 01:09:50] we just had an accrediting
[01:09:50 - 01:09:50] site visit um we were
[01:09:50 - 01:09:53] in 23 uh this was
[01:09:53 - 01:09:56] not anything that came up
[01:09:56 - 01:09:56] with um uh with the
[01:09:56 - 01:09:58] site visit or the off-site
[01:09:58 - 01:09:58] visit we were found in
[01:10:01 - 01:10:01] compliance with the ratio fulltime
[01:10:01 - 01:10:03] so you don't you don't
[01:10:03 - 01:10:05] worry about it the next
[01:10:05 - 01:10:05] time is in 2020 where
[01:10:05 - 01:10:07] it'll come up and they'll
[01:10:07 - 01:10:07] look at that closely want
[01:10:09 - 01:10:09] to make sure that we're
[01:10:09 - 01:10:09] always in a good to
[01:10:10 - 01:10:14] make sure that we're always
[01:10:15 - 01:10:20] in a good position so
[01:10:20 - 01:10:20] this is a look at
[01:10:20 - 01:10:24] what the additional funding requests
[01:10:24 - 01:10:27] for 2526 are under the
[01:10:27 - 01:10:30] critical needs uh overall there's
[01:10:30 - 01:10:30] a request for 1 7
[01:10:33 - 01:10:33] million what changed from the
[01:10:33 - 01:10:37] june 25th presentation is we
[01:10:37 - 01:10:40] had initially submitted a request
[01:10:40 - 01:10:43] for 264 000 in increase
[01:10:43 - 01:10:46] in insurance premiums well now
[01:10:46 - 01:10:46] the insurance carriers have provided
[01:10:47 - 01:10:47] uh what they're going to
[01:10:47 - 01:10:49] what they're going to ask
[01:10:49 - 01:10:50] for for insurance so we
[01:10:52 - 01:10:52] lowered that to what the
[01:10:52 - 01:10:54] increase is for insurance rates
[01:10:54 - 01:10:56] so that has been lowered
[01:10:56 - 01:10:56] and then as i mentioned
[01:10:59 - 01:10:59] earlier the increase of 8
[01:10:59 - 01:11:02] to the health insurance uh
[01:11:02 - 01:11:05] originally we had estimated 450
[01:11:05 - 01:11:05] 000 we were off on
[01:11:05 - 01:11:08] that we were too low
[01:11:08 - 01:11:08] uh we uh updated our
[01:11:11 - 01:11:11] numbers our projections for health
[01:11:14 - 01:11:14] insurance costs 8 of that
[01:11:14 - 01:11:18] cost has resulted in 74
[01:11:18 - 01:11:21] 000 that we need for
[01:11:21 - 01:11:24] health insurance the other must
[01:11:24 - 01:11:24] be funded items have not
[01:11:27 - 01:11:27] changed from the last presentation
[01:11:29 - 01:11:29] under the other funding request
[01:11:29 - 01:11:32] from executive levels uh that
[01:11:32 - 01:11:37] is decreased from uh 2
[01:11:37 - 01:11:39] 4 million down to 1
[01:11:39 - 01:11:42] 956 a decrease of about
[01:11:42 - 01:11:45] 400 000 a little over
[01:11:45 - 01:11:45] 400 000 uh the main
[01:11:45 - 01:11:47] decrease came in the instruction
[01:11:47 - 01:11:51] and workforce education area um
[01:11:51 - 01:12:04] so that's the main so
[01:12:04 - 01:12:04] this slide is a compilation
[01:12:04 - 01:12:07] of the big numbers that
[01:12:07 - 01:12:09] we saw for total projected
[01:12:09 - 01:12:13] revenues the first row shows
[01:12:13 - 01:12:13] the number that we covered
[01:12:13 - 01:12:17] under total projected revenues 173
[01:12:17 - 01:12:20] 9 million so we cannot
[01:12:20 - 01:12:22] exceed that that's going to
[01:12:22 - 01:12:22] be our uh top of
[01:12:22 - 01:12:25] the top of the budget
[01:12:25 - 01:12:30] line and the baseline preliminary
[01:12:30 - 01:12:33] budget is 165 4 million
[01:12:33 - 01:12:33] i'm looking in the no
[01:12:33 - 01:12:37] salary increase column just to
[01:12:37 - 01:12:37] start a review of this
[01:12:39 - 01:12:39] particular slide uh it results
[01:12:39 - 01:12:42] in a budget surplus of
[01:12:42 - 01:12:42] 8 point around 8 5
[01:12:42 - 01:12:43] budget surplus of 8 point
[01:12:43 - 01:12:44] around 8 5 million million
[01:12:47 - 01:12:47] so how is that allocated
[01:12:47 - 01:12:49] well we have must be
[01:12:49 - 01:12:49] funded the increases that are
[01:12:53 - 01:12:53] mandatory that we have to
[01:12:53 - 01:12:56] cover of 1 7 million
[01:12:56 - 01:12:56] and then recall at the
[01:12:56 - 01:12:59] june 25th budget presentation workshop
[01:12:59 - 01:13:01] uh we talked about the
[01:13:01 - 01:13:04] 6 adjustment to the salary
[01:13:04 - 01:13:04] tables where anybody making less
[01:13:07 - 01:13:07] than 10 an hour would
[01:13:07 - 01:13:10] be brought up to 10
[01:13:10 - 01:13:10] that was about 200 000
[01:13:10 - 01:13:13] of this particular line item
[01:13:13 - 01:13:15] request and the difference was
[01:13:15 - 01:13:15] a 6 increase to the
[01:13:18 - 01:13:18] entry levels on the tables
[01:13:18 - 01:13:21] which will allow for recruitment
[01:13:21 - 01:13:25] and retaining staff so uh
[01:13:25 - 01:13:25] that's what that 672 000
[01:13:29 - 01:13:29] is all about in the
[01:13:29 - 01:13:31] no salary increase column it
[01:13:31 - 01:13:31] results in a surplus before
[01:13:34 - 01:13:34] additional request of 6 1
[01:13:34 - 01:13:37] million and so uh we
[01:13:37 - 01:13:40] looked at the additional request
[01:13:40 - 01:13:40] of 1 9 million so
[01:13:40 - 01:13:41] if there was no salary
[01:13:41 - 01:13:41] increase there would be a
[01:13:45 - 01:13:45] surplus of 4 1 million
[01:13:48 - 01:13:48] so the way this slide
[01:13:48 - 01:13:48] is laid out a 1
[01:13:55 - 01:13:55] this includes uh for the
[01:13:55 - 01:13:56] related this includes uh for
[01:13:56 - 01:14:00] the related benefits benefits for
[01:14:00 - 01:14:00] a salary increase as well
[01:14:03 - 01:14:03] so in the 1 call
[01:14:03 - 01:14:03] you then see when you
[01:14:07 - 01:14:07] plug that number in it
[01:14:07 - 01:14:09] results in a increase in
[01:14:09 - 01:14:09] banium reserve of 3 1
[01:14:09 - 01:14:10] increase in banium reserve of
[01:14:11 - 01:14:14] 3 1 million million so
[01:14:14 - 01:14:14] as you move across the
[01:14:14 - 01:14:18] columns here and look at
[01:14:18 - 01:14:18] the 3 column you see
[01:14:18 - 01:14:21] that the value of a
[01:14:21 - 01:14:21] 3 salary increase is a
[01:14:23 - 01:14:26] little over 3 million and
[01:14:26 - 01:14:26] results in an increase to
[01:14:26 - 01:14:35] the benium if you continue
[01:14:35 - 01:14:35] across a 5 would result
[01:14:38 - 01:14:38] in a uh need to
[01:14:38 - 01:14:38] go into benium reserve a
[01:14:40 - 01:14:40] negative amount of almost a
[01:14:40 - 01:14:41] million negative amount of almost
[01:14:41 - 01:14:44] a million dollars dollars what
[01:14:44 - 01:14:44] does the fed uh expect
[01:14:44 - 01:14:46] inflation to be this year
[01:14:48 - 01:14:48] the inflation rate right now
[01:14:48 - 01:14:51] is i think about 2
[01:14:51 - 01:14:56] 4 dr somewhere yeah it
[01:14:56 - 01:14:56] rose to 2 7 um
[01:14:56 - 01:14:56] 2 7 but um i
[01:14:58 - 01:14:58] think the current ratio shows
[01:14:58 - 01:15:02] it it trending down once
[01:15:02 - 01:15:04] again um it's a great
[01:15:04 - 01:15:07] question judge you and economists
[01:15:07 - 01:15:07] um will continue to try
[01:15:07 - 01:15:09] and figure that out they
[01:15:09 - 01:15:11] do anticipate that inflation will
[01:15:11 - 01:15:11] will start to get closer
[01:15:14 - 01:15:14] to 2 um at the
[01:15:14 - 01:15:14] end of this year going
[01:15:22 - 01:15:22] yes sir look at this
[01:15:22 - 01:15:25] the bottom line additional requests
[01:15:25 - 01:15:26] going to the previous page
[01:15:26 - 01:15:30] it said additional funding requests
[01:15:30 - 01:15:32] for 2025 ed says critical
[01:15:32 - 01:15:32] needs must be funded 1
[01:15:32 - 01:15:34] 7 million and then he
[01:15:34 - 01:15:38] said other funding requests and
[01:15:38 - 01:15:38] i i don't see as
[01:15:38 - 01:15:40] must be requested but the
[01:15:40 - 01:15:40] total of all of that
[01:15:45 - 01:15:45] is uh 44 000 less
[01:15:45 - 01:15:48] under 2 million but we
[01:15:48 - 01:15:48] take all of that do
[01:15:48 - 01:15:51] i take that to mean
[01:15:51 - 01:15:51] that even though it's not
[01:15:51 - 01:15:53] must be funded we're going
[01:15:53 - 01:15:55] to say we're going to
[01:15:55 - 01:15:55] fund all of those requests
[01:15:55 - 01:15:57] at the requested amount so
[01:15:57 - 01:16:03] in other words that 1
[01:16:03 - 01:16:03] 956 million is is is
[01:16:03 - 01:16:06] as accepted it's my revenue
[01:16:06 - 01:16:12] to yes okay why would
[01:16:12 - 01:16:12] it be preliminary you mean
[01:16:14 - 01:16:14] just because whole budget's preliminary
[01:16:21 - 01:16:21] so are there any other
[01:16:21 - 01:16:23] questions relating related to the
[01:16:23 - 01:16:25] funding strategy relating related to
[01:16:26 - 01:16:33] the funding strategy options so
[01:16:33 - 01:16:33] what are the next steps
[01:16:33 - 01:16:36] the next steps are there's
[01:16:36 - 01:16:37] an item today to approve
[01:16:37 - 01:16:37] a salary enhancement by the

[01:18:48 - 01:18:51] mr 16 in budget my
[01:18:51 - 01:18:53] recommendation to the board uh
[01:18:53 - 01:18:53] to entertain um for your
[01:18:55 - 01:18:55] consideration to look at a
[01:18:55 - 01:18:58] salary enhancement of 3 um
[01:18:58 - 01:19:01] that provides again um a
[01:19:01 - 01:19:01] cost of living adjustment as
[01:19:04 - 01:19:04] well as dealing with inflation
[01:19:04 - 01:19:07] and at the same time
[01:19:07 - 01:19:07] not having a budget so
[01:19:10 - 01:19:10] tight that we're only seeing
[01:19:10 - 01:19:13] um a 48 000 miami
[01:19:13 - 01:19:16] reserve uh this would allow
[01:19:16 - 01:19:16] us to a 3 asset
[01:19:16 - 01:19:19] would allow us to still
[01:19:19 - 01:19:21] maintain approximately a million dollar
[01:19:21 - 01:19:21] miami reserve i'd remind the
[01:19:25 - 01:19:25] board that uh based on
[01:19:25 - 01:19:28] an outcomes um model the
[01:19:28 - 01:19:30] the state appropriations will change
[01:19:30 - 01:19:30] annually and we've been fortunate
[01:19:33 - 01:19:33] based on the good work
[01:19:33 - 01:19:35] of um everyone at the
[01:19:35 - 01:19:35] college led by my colleagues
[01:19:35 - 01:19:38] on my left um that
[01:19:38 - 01:19:38] we've been able to see
[01:19:40 - 01:19:40] state appropriations go up since
[01:19:40 - 01:19:42] we implemented this new funding
[01:19:42 - 01:19:46] model in 2023 and we've
[01:19:46 - 01:19:48] gone up annually there will
[01:19:48 - 01:19:48] come a time where we
[01:19:48 - 01:19:51] will see an adjustment downward
[01:19:51 - 01:19:53] based on um things that
[01:19:53 - 01:19:53] the state is putting in
[01:19:53 - 01:19:55] place i remind the board
[01:19:55 - 01:19:58] they're not funding all associate
[01:19:58 - 01:19:58] degrees any longer it went
[01:20:01 - 01:20:01] from 10 years to 5
[01:20:01 - 01:20:04] years in one bienium uh
[01:20:04 - 01:20:04] we we're losing um funding
[01:20:04 - 01:20:05] for six associates degrees it
[01:20:05 - 01:20:07] doesn't mean we're going to
[01:20:07 - 01:20:08] stop providing those to students
[01:20:08 - 01:20:08] we're going to try to
[01:20:08 - 01:20:11] get them through faster and
[01:20:11 - 01:20:13] get them to transfer as
[01:20:13 - 01:20:13] quickly as possible uh but
[01:20:13 - 01:20:15] it's my recommendation that the
[01:20:15 - 01:20:17] board entertain a 3 salary
[01:20:17 - 01:20:18] enhancement for the a 3
