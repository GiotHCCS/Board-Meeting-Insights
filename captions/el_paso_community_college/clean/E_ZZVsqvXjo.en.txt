[00:01:13 - 00:01:13] student and enrollment services um
[00:01:13 - 00:01:15] and jumping right into our
[00:01:15 - 00:01:18] signature event on ensuring that
[00:01:18 - 00:01:19] our community knows about the
[00:01:19 - 00:01:22] institution that our high school
[00:01:22 - 00:01:22] seniors realize um we're not
[00:01:23 - 00:01:23] going to give them an
[00:01:23 - 00:01:25] excuse we're going to go
[00:01:25 - 00:01:25] to them while they're there
[00:01:26 - 00:01:26] we're going to close the
[00:01:26 - 00:01:28] deal while they're still in
[00:01:28 - 00:01:30] high school and so this
[00:01:30 - 00:01:30] is a signature event that
[00:01:30 - 00:01:33] we have it started in
[00:01:33 - 00:01:33] in march at harmony we
[00:01:35 - 00:01:35] we're going to recruit everyone
[00:01:35 - 00:01:37] you know charter schools etc
[00:01:37 - 00:01:39] we're going to recruit them
[00:01:39 - 00:01:39] we're going to try to
[00:01:40 - 00:01:40] encourage them to enroll in
[00:01:40 - 00:01:44] higher ed the data is
[00:01:44 - 00:01:44] overwhelming 71 72 of all
[00:01:46 - 00:01:46] jobs by 2031 will require
[00:01:46 - 00:01:49] some post-secary education or training
[00:01:49 - 00:01:51] and so we we want
[00:01:51 - 00:01:51] to be able to facilitate
[00:01:53 - 00:01:53] this going all the way
[00:01:53 - 00:01:55] through um may the 3rd
[00:01:55 - 00:01:55] and that's tahhano day that's
[00:01:57 - 00:01:57] going to be at the
[00:01:57 - 00:01:58] trans mountain campus this this
[00:01:58 - 00:01:58] time i'm going to touch
[00:01:58 - 00:02:01] on that a bit more
[00:02:01 - 00:02:01] um in addition dr m
[00:02:03 - 00:02:03] and his team uh continue
[00:02:03 - 00:02:06] to work really hard on
[00:02:06 - 00:02:06] on ensuring that our seniors
[00:02:06 - 00:02:10] um go forward and and
[00:02:10 - 00:02:12] utilize apply texas um to
[00:02:12 - 00:02:12] to apply for higher education
[00:02:12 - 00:02:13] in the state of texas
[00:02:13 - 00:02:16] any public institution can utilize
[00:02:16 - 00:02:18] apply texas so it's not
[00:02:18 - 00:02:18] us just recruiting for us
[00:02:20 - 00:02:20] although that's uh a primary
[00:02:20 - 00:02:22] objective but it's us for
[00:02:22 - 00:02:24] recruiting for higher ed period
[00:02:24 - 00:02:24] trying to get them enrolled
[00:02:26 - 00:02:26] as you can see we
[00:02:26 - 00:02:29] had over 8 000 applications
[00:02:29 - 00:02:29] by uh october we were
[00:02:29 - 00:02:32] up to 9 000 by
[00:02:32 - 00:02:34] december then the holidays and
[00:02:34 - 00:02:34] students are like everyone else
[00:02:34 - 00:02:37] uh we had about 65
[00:02:37 - 00:02:39] between december 3rd and january
[00:02:39 - 00:02:39] 9th but we've now seen
[00:02:39 - 00:02:42] it pick up once again
[00:02:42 - 00:02:45] to over 9700 applications i'd
[00:02:45 - 00:02:45] remind everyone we have about
[00:02:45 - 00:02:47] 12 000 seniors in region
[00:02:47 - 00:02:49] 19 so we're doing extremely
[00:02:49 - 00:02:49] well and we're going to
[00:02:50 - 00:02:50] continue to work on that
[00:02:50 - 00:02:52] and continue to move that
[00:02:52 - 00:02:52] forward we need to ensure
[00:02:55 - 00:02:55] that our isd partners that
[00:02:55 - 00:02:57] they take advantage of dual
[00:02:57 - 00:03:00] credit and early college high
[00:03:00 - 00:03:03] school opportunities and the epcc
[00:03:03 - 00:03:03] roundup uh held on the
[00:03:03 - 00:03:05] 27th of january was a
[00:03:05 - 00:03:07] real opportunity for them to
[00:03:07 - 00:03:07] take advantage of those areas
[00:03:07 - 00:03:09] and to ensure that they
[00:03:09 - 00:03:12] have that opportunity to enroll
[00:03:12 - 00:03:12] uh in addition high school
[00:03:14 - 00:03:14] counselors are incredibly important um
[00:03:16 - 00:03:16] they have access to the
[00:03:16 - 00:03:18] student body on a regular
[00:03:18 - 00:03:18] basis we want to make
[00:03:18 - 00:03:20] sure that they're providing that
[00:03:20 - 00:03:23] student body with accurate information
[00:03:23 - 00:03:25] and that they know about
[00:03:25 - 00:03:27] the institution i shared you
[00:03:27 - 00:03:27] know this is my 31st
[00:03:27 - 00:03:30] year in higher ed um
[00:03:30 - 00:03:30] the time goes by really
[00:03:30 - 00:03:33] fast many of our counselors
[00:03:33 - 00:03:36] are um longer in the
[00:03:36 - 00:03:36] tooth as i am and
[00:03:36 - 00:03:38] so we want to make
[00:03:38 - 00:03:38] sure they know and they're
[00:03:38 - 00:03:40] aware of all the incredible
[00:03:40 - 00:03:42] programming all the incredible um
[00:03:42 - 00:03:43] programs that the institution has
[00:03:43 - 00:03:46] to offer all the investment
[00:03:46 - 00:03:46] that we've made in developing
[00:03:47 - 00:03:47] new programs and developing new
[00:03:50 - 00:03:50] buildings uh etc and so
[00:03:50 - 00:03:53] we want to make sure
[00:03:53 - 00:03:53] this provided we had 40
[00:03:53 - 00:03:56] presenters 88 exhibitors 460 counselors
[00:03:56 - 00:03:59] as well as 40 staff
[00:03:59 - 00:03:59] and we didn't do it
[00:03:59 - 00:04:01] alone we did in in
[00:04:01 - 00:04:01] cooperation with utep as well
[00:04:03 - 00:04:03] but we need to make
[00:04:03 - 00:04:05] sure that they're aware of
[00:04:05 - 00:04:05] the college and the incredible
[00:04:07 - 00:04:07] programs that we have to
[00:04:07 - 00:04:10] offer uh during the pandemic
[00:04:10 - 00:04:10] um we saw this we
[00:04:13 - 00:04:13] saw a real shift in
[00:04:13 - 00:04:15] enrollment um where the career
[00:04:15 - 00:04:18] technical education programs continue to
[00:04:18 - 00:04:20] rise during the pandemic while
[00:04:20 - 00:04:20] academic transfer programs um we
[00:04:22 - 00:04:22] saw some enrollment decreases the
[00:04:22 - 00:04:24] good news is we're seeing
[00:04:24 - 00:04:26] those come back but we're
[00:04:26 - 00:04:26] continuing to see our cte
[00:04:29 - 00:04:29] programs um demand for those
[00:04:29 - 00:04:32] continue to increase uh so
[00:04:32 - 00:04:32] here's a health cte as
[00:04:34 - 00:04:34] well as stem event that
[00:04:34 - 00:04:37] we held um in addition
[00:04:37 - 00:04:37] we're doing programspecific addition we're
[00:04:37 - 00:04:41] doing programspecific recruitment recruitment activities
[00:04:41 - 00:04:41] and so we we did
[00:04:41 - 00:04:44] an activity for nursing uh
[00:04:44 - 00:04:44] and again nursing is a
[00:04:46 - 00:04:46] program that we probably don't
[00:04:46 - 00:04:48] have to advertise at all
[00:04:48 - 00:04:50] we're still going to do
[00:04:50 - 00:04:50] that so the community understands
[00:04:52 - 00:04:52] and i'll share more about
[00:04:52 - 00:04:54] nursing as i go through
[00:04:54 - 00:04:56] this presentation but so they
[00:04:56 - 00:04:56] understand the great programs that
[00:04:58 - 00:04:58] we have uh again i
[00:04:58 - 00:05:00] mentioned to hano day that's
[00:05:00 - 00:05:00] going to be on may
[00:05:00 - 00:05:02] the 3 last year it
[00:05:02 - 00:05:02] was on may the 4th
[00:05:02 - 00:05:04] or may the 4th be
[00:05:04 - 00:05:04] with you uh we had
[00:05:04 - 00:05:06] a star wars theme it
[00:05:06 - 00:05:06] was great it was at
[00:05:06 - 00:05:08] the mission del paso campus
[00:05:08 - 00:05:11] i made sure that i
[00:05:11 - 00:05:11] went with my oldest um
[00:05:11 - 00:05:12] in addition we're going to
[00:05:12 - 00:05:14] have it at the trans
[00:05:14 - 00:05:14] mountain dr mai and his
[00:05:14 - 00:05:15] team rotate these events so
[00:05:15 - 00:05:17] we're going to get to
[00:05:17 - 00:05:17] each of the respective campuses
[00:05:19 - 00:05:19] as time goes forward but
[00:05:19 - 00:05:20] we're certainly excited about this
[00:05:23 - 00:05:23] opportunity uh and again it's
[00:05:23 - 00:05:24] an opportunity the students that
[00:05:24 - 00:05:26] start the process during collegebound
[00:05:26 - 00:05:28] but don't quite finish it
[00:05:28 - 00:05:28] that we're able to get
[00:05:30 - 00:05:30] them back in and help
[00:05:30 - 00:05:32] them finish that prior to
[00:05:32 - 00:05:32] summer as well as the
[00:05:32 - 00:05:35] fall term um you know
[00:05:35 - 00:05:35] we have a lot of
[00:05:37 - 00:05:37] services for our students we
[00:05:37 - 00:05:38] need to ensure that they
[00:05:38 - 00:05:40] know about the resources available
[00:05:40 - 00:05:42] to them uh the texas
[00:05:42 - 00:05:42] pathway action plan part of
[00:05:42 - 00:05:45] it was to ensure that
[00:05:45 - 00:05:45] students knew about a lot
[00:05:48 - 00:05:48] of the services from parent
[00:05:48 - 00:05:52] resources to the tahano mecado
[00:05:52 - 00:05:52] to epcc cares um this
[00:05:54 - 00:05:54] these are events that really
[00:05:54 - 00:05:56] ensured and trying to advertise
[00:05:56 - 00:05:58] these trying to ensure that
[00:05:58 - 00:05:58] our students know about them
[00:06:00 - 00:06:00] you can see the results
[00:06:00 - 00:06:01] um still not where we
[00:06:01 - 00:06:01] want to be but we're
[00:06:01 - 00:06:03] getting much better um students
[00:06:03 - 00:06:06] were unaware of the food
[00:06:06 - 00:06:06] pantry and 23 about 80
[00:06:06 - 00:06:08] of our students were unaware
[00:06:08 - 00:06:11] we were able to drop
[00:06:11 - 00:06:11] that down to about 67
[00:06:11 - 00:06:13] we're going to continue to
[00:06:13 - 00:06:14] advertise these we're going to
[00:06:14 - 00:06:16] continue to ensure that students
[00:06:16 - 00:06:20] are aware of these some
[00:06:20 - 00:06:20] of the via specific events
[00:06:22 - 00:06:22] um obviously we had the
[00:06:22 - 00:06:24] fall festival um that was
[00:06:24 - 00:06:24] on the 30th of october

[00:06:33 - 00:06:33] before finals you know we
[00:06:33 - 00:06:35] have to make sure that
[00:06:35 - 00:06:37] we're moving forward with the
[00:06:37 - 00:06:37] lingo of our students sounds
[00:06:39 - 00:06:39] like my one of my
[00:06:39 - 00:06:42] sons saying that um we
[00:06:42 - 00:06:42] also we also had welcome
[00:06:42 - 00:06:45] week so we have campus
[00:06:45 - 00:06:47] specific initiatives again to ensure
[00:06:47 - 00:06:49] that our students take advantage
[00:06:49 - 00:06:51] of the services utilize everything
[00:06:51 - 00:06:51] that's available to them all
[00:06:53 - 00:06:53] in an effort to facilitate
[00:06:53 - 00:06:56] their success we will continue
[00:06:56 - 00:06:57] to move forward with that
[00:06:57 - 00:06:59] let me talk about student

[00:07:01 - 00:07:01] student government association and the
[00:07:03 - 00:07:03] great work that they do
[00:07:03 - 00:07:05] they really do an incredible
[00:07:05 - 00:07:08] job of representing their constituents
[00:07:08 - 00:07:11] ensuring that those voices are
[00:07:11 - 00:07:11] heard ensuring ensuring that they
[00:07:13 - 00:07:13] have that opportunity to speak
[00:07:13 - 00:07:16] on behalf of students um

[00:07:23 - 00:07:23] february the 3rd we're in
[00:07:23 - 00:07:24] the midst of a legislative
[00:07:24 - 00:07:27] session i'm going to share
[00:07:27 - 00:07:27] some of that data at
[00:07:27 - 00:07:29] the end of the presentation
[00:07:29 - 00:07:29] with you all so that
[00:07:31 - 00:07:31] you're aware very transparent of
[00:07:31 - 00:07:33] what's going on in austin
[00:07:33 - 00:07:35] there's some really good bills
[00:07:35 - 00:07:37] there's some concerning bills from
[00:07:37 - 00:07:38] my perspective purely my perspective
[00:07:38 - 00:07:38] but we want to make
[00:07:38 - 00:07:41] sure that our students are
[00:07:41 - 00:07:43] there i had the opportunity
[00:07:43 - 00:07:43] to testify i thought i
[00:07:43 - 00:07:45] was done i chaired the
[00:07:45 - 00:07:48] organization in 2023 but i
[00:07:48 - 00:07:48] got invited to testify in
[00:07:49 - 00:07:49] front of house higher education
[00:07:52 - 00:07:52] committee this this past month
[00:07:52 - 00:07:53] and went forward and testified
[00:07:53 - 00:07:56] and so commissioner roser was
[00:07:56 - 00:07:58] on my left i testified
[00:07:58 - 00:07:58] we had ray martinez the
[00:08:00 - 00:08:00] president and ceo of the
[00:08:00 - 00:08:01] organization next to me and
[00:08:01 - 00:08:01] then we had a gentleman
[00:08:03 - 00:08:06] from texas 2036 we presented
[00:08:06 - 00:08:08] our testimony legislature had no
[00:08:08 - 00:08:10] questions and then they had
[00:08:10 - 00:08:12] a student um testify and
[00:08:12 - 00:08:12] i can tell you that
[00:08:12 - 00:08:14] there was six seven questions
[00:08:14 - 00:08:16] from the legislators for the
[00:08:16 - 00:08:18] students that's how important it
[00:08:18 - 00:08:18] is for our students to
[00:08:18 - 00:08:20] have their voices heard that's
[00:08:20 - 00:08:22] who the legislature wants to
[00:08:22 - 00:08:24] hear from it's my responsibility
[00:08:24 - 00:08:27] and i'll continue to provide
[00:08:27 - 00:08:29] information to our legislators but
[00:08:29 - 00:08:29] it shows you how important
[00:08:29 - 00:08:31] the student voice is when
[00:08:31 - 00:08:33] all the questions went to
[00:08:33 - 00:08:36] the student the tano marcado
[00:08:36 - 00:08:37] this is an incredible initiative
[00:08:37 - 00:08:40] that we're going to continue
[00:08:40 - 00:08:40] to work on we're working
[00:08:42 - 00:08:42] hard to deal with student
[00:08:42 - 00:08:45] hunger it's changed uh our
[00:08:45 - 00:08:47] attitudes towards this has changed
[00:08:47 - 00:08:47] i've shared with you i
[00:08:47 - 00:08:49] lost 15 pounds my first
[00:08:49 - 00:08:51] semester in college uh because
[00:08:51 - 00:08:51] i forgot to budget for
[00:08:52 - 00:08:53] food and i wasn't going
[00:08:53 - 00:08:56] to call home for additional
[00:08:56 - 00:08:59] resources um but we've learned
[00:08:59 - 00:08:59] a whole lot and sarah
[00:08:59 - 00:09:01] goldric among others has taught
[00:09:01 - 00:09:02] us that it's very difficult
[00:09:02 - 00:09:04] to learn when you're hungry
[00:09:04 - 00:09:04] and so we want to
[00:09:04 - 00:09:06] ensure that our students have
[00:09:06 - 00:09:08] that opportunity that they're able
[00:09:08 - 00:09:10] to utilize the services that
[00:09:10 - 00:09:10] we have available to them
[00:09:10 - 00:09:12] i'll share with you it's
[00:09:12 - 00:09:14] it's become a challenge to
[00:09:14 - 00:09:14] to maintain to keep it
[00:09:16 - 00:09:16] stocked and so i've made
[00:09:16 - 00:09:18] a recommendation to the board
[00:09:18 - 00:09:20] to utilize our student success
[00:09:20 - 00:09:22] endowment fund that's the 30
[00:09:22 - 00:09:25] million that mckenzie scott gifted
[00:09:25 - 00:09:27] to the institution we've invested
[00:09:27 - 00:09:27] that money we're utilizing the
[00:09:29 - 00:09:29] residue 90 of that goes
[00:09:29 - 00:09:32] to scholarships 10 or 9
[00:09:32 - 00:09:34] of that is for emergencies
[00:09:34 - 00:09:34] what i've asked the board
[00:09:37 - 00:09:37] is to consider utilizing 1
[00:09:37 - 00:09:40] of that emergency to help
[00:09:40 - 00:09:43] stock the tahano marcado what
[00:09:43 - 00:09:46] what's more emergency than needing
[00:09:46 - 00:09:46] food and so currently that
[00:09:48 - 00:09:48] would be about 30 000
[00:09:48 - 00:09:50] um that would help us
[00:09:50 - 00:09:52] stock the medcad significantly so
[00:09:52 - 00:09:52] we're going to continue to
[00:09:52 - 00:09:55] work hard at this but
[00:09:55 - 00:09:55] i can't thank uh dr
[00:09:55 - 00:09:56] mai and all the team
[00:09:56 - 00:09:56] on the great work that
[00:09:59 - 00:09:59] they do with that um
[00:09:59 - 00:10:01] our women's cross country and
[00:10:01 - 00:10:03] half marathon want to uh
[00:10:03 - 00:10:07] share information with them uh
[00:10:07 - 00:10:10] they're uh their first time
[00:10:10 - 00:10:10] in athletic academic history that
[00:10:13 - 00:10:13] every single one of our
[00:10:13 - 00:10:16] athletes has uh incredible gpa
[00:10:16 - 00:10:16] as you can see and
[00:10:16 - 00:10:19] so we want to make
[00:10:19 - 00:10:19] sure that we uh continue
[00:10:19 - 00:10:21] to advocate i don't see
[00:10:21 - 00:10:21] uh i don't see our

[00:13:01 - 00:13:01] her and all of the
[00:13:02 - 00:13:02] committee that worked on this

[00:13:08 - 00:13:08] had 11 of the 12
[00:13:08 - 00:13:09] students that were successful in
[00:13:09 - 00:13:11] their first semester in engineering
[00:13:11 - 00:13:15] let me remind everyone as
[00:13:15 - 00:13:15] a as a former wannabe
[00:13:15 - 00:13:17] engineer um you have to
[00:13:17 - 00:13:17] be calculus ready you know
[00:13:19 - 00:13:19] i mean i know that
[00:13:19 - 00:13:20] college algebra is the course
[00:13:20 - 00:13:20] that we think of with
[00:13:22 - 00:13:22] mathematics for students to be
[00:13:22 - 00:13:24] college ready and it's wonderful
[00:13:24 - 00:13:26] course and does great work
[00:13:26 - 00:13:26] but to be an engineering
[00:13:28 - 00:13:28] major you have to be
[00:13:28 - 00:13:29] calculus ready which is two
[00:13:29 - 00:13:32] steps above college algebra you
[00:13:32 - 00:13:35] know so these students are
[00:13:35 - 00:13:35] um high achievers they work
[00:13:35 - 00:13:38] hard we saw 75 of
[00:13:38 - 00:13:40] them persisted from the fall
[00:13:40 - 00:13:40] term into the spring term
[00:13:40 - 00:13:42] excited about the progress we're
[00:13:42 - 00:13:44] going to continue to work
[00:13:44 - 00:13:45] hard to increase the size
[00:13:45 - 00:13:45] of this cohort it is
[00:13:46 - 00:13:48] a dualenrolled program so they're
[00:13:49 - 00:13:49] enrolled with the college as
[00:13:49 - 00:13:52] well as the university at

[00:14:08 - 00:14:10] and i'll talk about hacking
[00:14:10 - 00:14:12] and things of that nature
[00:14:12 - 00:14:12] we need to make sure
[00:14:12 - 00:14:14] that we educate our students
[00:14:14 - 00:14:14] on on the good uses
[00:14:16 - 00:14:16] of technology and ensuring that

[00:14:47 - 00:14:47] sidatuarees and from las crues
[00:14:47 - 00:14:49] um they they focused on
[00:14:49 - 00:14:50] this and so again teaching
[00:14:50 - 00:14:50] our students how to utilize

[00:15:04 - 00:15:06] resources within the budget to
[00:15:06 - 00:15:06] be able to provide um
[00:15:09 - 00:15:09] equipment needs for our programs
[00:15:09 - 00:15:11] and so fire technology they
[00:15:11 - 00:15:11] were able to get a
[00:15:13 - 00:15:13] new fire pumper this is
[00:15:13 - 00:15:14] incredibly important these are some
[00:15:14 - 00:15:17] of our first responders um
[00:15:17 - 00:15:17] but they were able to
[00:15:17 - 00:15:19] do that and be able
[00:15:19 - 00:15:21] to continue to have state-of-the-art
[00:15:21 - 00:15:23] technology so that when they
[00:15:23 - 00:15:23] finish and graduate and they
[00:15:23 - 00:15:26] move into the field that
[00:15:26 - 00:15:28] they're very aware of how
[00:15:28 - 00:15:28] to use the equipment that's
[00:15:31 - 00:15:31] available to them i'm going
[00:15:31 - 00:15:35] to touch a bit on
[00:15:35 - 00:15:35] um several of our selective
[00:15:37 - 00:15:37] programs so that we are
[00:15:37 - 00:15:38] an open admissions institution i'm
[00:15:38 - 00:15:40] very proud to be open
[00:15:40 - 00:15:42] admissions we have high expectations
[00:15:42 - 00:15:42] for the success of our
[00:15:44 - 00:15:44] students but we do have
[00:15:44 - 00:15:46] a number of selective programs
[00:15:46 - 00:15:48] primarily in nursing and allied
[00:15:48 - 00:15:48] health um and i want
[00:15:48 - 00:15:51] to speak to those simply
[00:15:51 - 00:15:53] because of the results that
[00:15:53 - 00:15:53] we're seeing based on the
[00:15:56 - 00:15:56] great work of our faculty
[00:15:56 - 00:15:57] and the commitment and dedication
[00:15:57 - 00:15:59] of the students in these
[00:15:59 - 00:16:01] respective programs the physical therapy
[00:16:01 - 00:16:03] assistant students uh had a
[00:16:03 - 00:16:04] 100 pass rate in their
[00:16:07 - 00:16:07] certification exams uh in 24
[00:16:07 - 00:16:09] uh they had a mean
[00:16:09 - 00:16:09] score that was seven points
[00:16:11 - 00:16:11] above the national average want

[00:16:16 - 00:16:18] are successful um this one's

[00:18:06 - 00:18:08] our surge tech students that
[00:18:08 - 00:18:09] were actually in the audience
[00:18:09 - 00:18:10] it was good to see
[00:18:12 - 00:18:12] them um but our surgical

[00:18:41 - 00:18:41] program we had the highest
[00:18:41 - 00:18:43] firsttime pass rate in the
[00:18:43 - 00:18:43] region so all of the
[00:18:45 - 00:18:45] public all of the private
[00:18:45 - 00:18:47] institutions in our community we
[00:18:47 - 00:18:49] had the highest pass rate
[00:18:49 - 00:18:49] again the quality of our
[00:18:49 - 00:18:53] program is outstanding um we
[00:18:53 - 00:18:53] in in we had on

[00:19:02 - 00:19:02] earners uh and it was
[00:19:05 - 00:19:05] 97 5 for our certificate
[00:19:05 - 00:19:08] of completion of vocational nurses
[00:19:08 - 00:19:11] we added 125 nurses to
[00:19:11 - 00:19:13] our community i've shared with
[00:19:13 - 00:19:13] you all i don't want

[00:19:19 - 00:19:21] the level that we're producing
[00:19:21 - 00:19:24] so certainly thrilled with that
[00:19:24 - 00:19:27] our vocational as i indicated
[00:19:27 - 00:19:27] they had a 97 12
[00:19:27 - 00:19:29] pass rate and they added
[00:19:29 - 00:19:32] 40 additional vocational nurses to
[00:19:32 - 00:19:32] our community so we continue
[00:19:34 - 00:19:34] to meet the needs of
[00:19:34 - 00:19:35] our hospitals in to meet
[00:19:35 - 00:19:35] the needs of our hospitals
[00:19:35 - 00:19:38] in our our community again
[00:19:38 - 00:19:41] mr flootus and dr smith
[00:19:41 - 00:19:41] um identified resources within the
[00:19:43 - 00:19:43] budget uh to be able
[00:19:43 - 00:19:45] to provide additional echo cardiography
[00:19:45 - 00:19:47] equipment upgrades you see that
[00:19:47 - 00:19:50] we were able to add
[00:19:50 - 00:19:50] a vascular ultrasound transducers as
[00:19:53 - 00:19:53] well as highfidelity cardiac ultrasound
[00:19:55 - 00:19:55] simulators i know it sounds
[00:19:55 - 00:19:57] easy to pronounce those but
[00:19:57 - 00:19:59] i've practiced a lot um
[00:19:59 - 00:19:59] but this is important that
[00:20:01 - 00:20:01] these students have access to
[00:20:01 - 00:20:04] the the the the cutting
[00:20:04 - 00:20:06] edge technology so that when
[00:20:06 - 00:20:06] they go into the field
[00:20:06 - 00:20:08] they know how to use
[00:20:08 - 00:20:10] the equipment appropriately uh the
[00:20:10 - 00:20:13] interprofessional simulation education center at
[00:20:13 - 00:20:16] epcc's rio grand campus is
[00:20:16 - 00:20:18] in the process of provisional
[00:20:18 - 00:20:21] accreditation i want to thank
[00:20:21 - 00:20:21] mr tomas sto as well

[00:20:48 - 00:20:50] have at the college and
[00:20:50 - 00:20:50] part of that is exposing

[00:20:52 - 00:20:54] equipment and and the kind
[00:20:54 - 00:20:54] of um programs that we

[00:25:12 - 00:25:12] programs uh as we see
[00:25:12 - 00:25:14] the demand for those respective
[00:25:14 - 00:25:17] programs we're looking at demand
[00:25:17 - 00:25:17] both in the field as
[00:25:17 - 00:25:19] well as student demand and
[00:25:19 - 00:25:21] we're looking at encouraging new
[00:25:21 - 00:25:23] program development for programs that
[00:25:23 - 00:25:23] are going to pay our
[00:25:26 - 00:25:26] students at least a living
[00:25:26 - 00:25:28] wage and so we uh
[00:25:28 - 00:25:28] developed an aas in music
[00:25:31 - 00:25:31] business an aas in audio
[00:25:31 - 00:25:33] engineering and a level two
[00:25:33 - 00:25:36] certificate in music technology program
[00:25:36 - 00:25:38] and so excited about this
[00:25:38 - 00:25:38] we're currently have 113 students
[00:25:40 - 00:25:40] that are enrolled in these
[00:25:40 - 00:25:42] respective programs uh and we'll
[00:25:42 - 00:25:45] continue to develop those and
[00:25:45 - 00:25:47] move those forward uh initiatives
[00:25:47 - 00:25:49] uh this is incredibly important
[00:25:49 - 00:25:49] i don't see a lot
[00:25:49 - 00:25:52] of students in the audience
[00:25:52 - 00:25:52] um but for students we
[00:25:55 - 00:25:55] want to ensure that you
[00:25:55 - 00:25:57] are incredibly involved with your
[00:25:57 - 00:25:59] civic responsibility from my perspective
[00:25:59 - 00:26:02] to vote and so we
[00:26:02 - 00:26:05] have a tahana pool worker
[00:26:05 - 00:26:05] grant it's a two-year 49

[00:26:20 - 00:26:21] the information to our students
[00:26:21 - 00:26:24] so that they're educated voters
[00:26:24 - 00:26:27] and that they go out

[00:27:12 - 00:27:14] december you see the overall
[00:27:14 - 00:27:17] graduation rate the transfer rates
[00:27:17 - 00:27:17] and the persistence rates these
[00:27:19 - 00:27:19] are these are tremendous programs
[00:27:19 - 00:27:21] that work um there's a
[00:27:21 - 00:27:21] lot of chatter at the

[00:27:58 - 00:28:00] that were available it's part
[00:28:00 - 00:28:03] of our aspen ascend uh
[00:28:03 - 00:28:06] initiative the aspen institute provided
[00:28:06 - 00:28:06] a 75 000 grant so
[00:28:06 - 00:28:07] that we can move forward
[00:28:07 - 00:28:07] and continue to ensure that
[00:28:10 - 00:28:10] we're serving our students that
[00:28:10 - 00:28:13] are parents as well as
[00:28:13 - 00:28:15] we possibly can um again
[00:28:15 - 00:28:18] our colleagues are collaborating to
[00:28:18 - 00:28:18] increase that student persistence uh
[00:28:20 - 00:28:20] we have a partnership with
[00:28:20 - 00:28:22] united way that was initiated
[00:28:22 - 00:28:24] in february again to connect
[00:28:24 - 00:28:26] students faculty and staff with
[00:28:26 - 00:28:29] community services that are available
[00:28:29 - 00:28:29] to them we have resiliency
[00:28:30 - 00:28:30] navigators that are available on
[00:28:30 - 00:28:33] each of the campuses one
[00:28:33 - 00:28:33] day a week want to
[00:28:34 - 00:28:34] make sure that everyone takes
[00:28:34 - 00:28:38] advantage of this as well
[00:28:38 - 00:28:38] miss luhan and her team
[00:28:39 - 00:28:39] continue to do a tremendous
[00:28:39 - 00:28:42] job with the first year
[00:28:42 - 00:28:42] experience this has been a
[00:28:43 - 00:28:43] long evolution of this particular
[00:28:47 - 00:28:47] program we started it in
[00:28:47 - 00:28:49] 2009 uh with a vision
[00:28:49 - 00:28:49] of how we could make
[00:28:49 - 00:28:52] this uh a go in
[00:28:52 - 00:28:52] 2016 we received an hsi
[00:28:55 - 00:28:55] hispanic serving institution title 5
[00:28:57 - 00:28:57] grant um and we were
[00:28:57 - 00:29:00] able to establish an early
[00:29:00 - 00:29:02] alert program and this particular
[00:29:02 - 00:29:05] grant is the best illustration
[00:29:05 - 00:29:05] of how we are supposed
[00:29:05 - 00:29:08] to utilize grants grants are
[00:29:08 - 00:29:10] seed money they allow you
[00:29:10 - 00:29:10] to move forward with an
[00:29:13 - 00:29:13] idea that we think will
[00:29:13 - 00:29:15] work to help our community
[00:29:15 - 00:29:15] to help our student body
[00:29:16 - 00:29:17] etc and if it does
[00:29:17 - 00:29:20] work well the expectation is
[00:29:20 - 00:29:20] that you institutionalize as much
[00:29:20 - 00:29:23] as you can within the
[00:29:23 - 00:29:25] budget dr smith and his
[00:29:25 - 00:29:25] team have done a tremendous
[00:29:25 - 00:29:27] job of institutionalizing the firstear
[00:29:29 - 00:29:29] experience program you see that
[00:29:29 - 00:29:32] we opened the northwest firstear
[00:29:32 - 00:29:34] center in october of last
[00:29:34 - 00:29:34] year uh and then you
[00:29:37 - 00:29:37] see the first one that
[00:29:37 - 00:29:40] we opened here at the
[00:29:40 - 00:29:40] viveet campus in february of
[00:29:40 - 00:29:42] 2019 again tremendous job of
[00:29:42 - 00:29:45] moving that forward uh dr
[00:29:45 - 00:29:49] castillo tar and her team
[00:29:49 - 00:29:49] did a great job of
[00:29:49 - 00:29:51] of epcc's cares grand opening
[00:29:51 - 00:29:51] uh we want to make
[00:29:51 - 00:29:53] sure that uh we continue
[00:29:53 - 00:29:55] to move this forward it
[00:29:55 - 00:29:57] was well represented by several
[00:29:57 - 00:29:57] of our community partners we
[00:30:00 - 00:30:00] had that in february of
[00:30:00 - 00:30:01] this year um so again
[00:30:01 - 00:30:01] want to make sure that
[00:30:01 - 00:30:03] every our student body is
[00:30:03 - 00:30:07] aware of these great services
[00:30:07 - 00:30:07] that we have available to
[00:30:12 - 00:30:12] them oops let me go
[00:30:12 - 00:30:14] back again um dr smith
[00:30:14 - 00:30:14] and his team do a
[00:30:14 - 00:30:18] tra a tremendous job of
[00:30:18 - 00:30:18] capitalizing on house bill 8
[00:30:18 - 00:30:21] so house bill 8 allowed
[00:30:21 - 00:30:21] us um not only to
[00:30:23 - 00:30:23] be funded based on outcomes
[00:30:23 - 00:30:25] things of that nature but
[00:30:25 - 00:30:26] it also allowed us to
[00:30:28 - 00:30:28] be funded for nonredit and
[00:30:28 - 00:30:31] short-term credentials that in the
[00:30:31 - 00:30:33] past we'd never been funded
[00:30:33 - 00:30:33] for uh we're only going
[00:30:33 - 00:30:35] to offer the credentials again
[00:30:35 - 00:30:37] that are in demand in
[00:30:37 - 00:30:37] our community and that are
[00:30:39 - 00:30:39] going to pay our students
[00:30:39 - 00:30:41] at least a living wage
[00:30:41 - 00:30:41] um i know i have
[00:30:41 - 00:30:43] colleagues that may be offering
[00:30:43 - 00:30:45] different kinds of programs that's
[00:30:45 - 00:30:45] just not in my core
[00:30:46 - 00:30:47] and what we believe in
[00:30:47 - 00:30:49] we're going to offer programs
[00:30:49 - 00:30:49] that ensure a living wage
[00:30:49 - 00:30:52] for our students and that
[00:30:52 - 00:30:54] are in demand uh so
[00:30:54 - 00:30:54] we've developed significant number of
[00:30:56 - 00:30:56] occupational skills awards we have
[00:30:56 - 00:30:58] new certificate uh programs we've
[00:30:58 - 00:31:01] done revised fields of studies
[00:31:01 - 00:31:04] um you see the program
[00:31:04 - 00:31:04] uh name changes as well
[00:31:04 - 00:31:08] so again this is uh
[00:31:08 - 00:31:08] an us in an effort
[00:31:08 - 00:31:10] to serve our community but
[00:31:10 - 00:31:12] also an effort to ensure
[00:31:12 - 00:31:12] that we're taking in full
[00:31:14 - 00:31:14] advantage of house bill 8
[00:31:14 - 00:31:22] and what the our stem
[00:31:22 - 00:31:25] fueta program again another hsi

[00:34:02 - 00:34:05] expansion of artificial intelligence um
[00:34:05 - 00:34:08] but we understand that we
[00:34:08 - 00:34:10] need to ensure that children
[00:34:10 - 00:34:10] have access and they're exposed
[00:34:12 - 00:34:12] to stem programs at an
[00:34:12 - 00:34:15] early age to develop that

[00:40:44 - 00:40:46] audit services um we wanted

[00:40:48 - 00:40:48] additional projects the first one
[00:40:48 - 00:40:50] we asked them to look
[00:40:50 - 00:40:50] at was senate bill 17
[00:40:54 - 00:40:54] passed in the 2023 legislative
[00:40:54 - 00:40:55] session we have to ensure

[00:41:00 - 00:41:04] bill 17 is affectionately known
[00:41:04 - 00:41:07] as the anti-dei law in
[00:41:07 - 00:41:07] texas we have to ensure
[00:41:07 - 00:41:09] that we are in full
[00:41:09 - 00:41:09] compliance with it and so
[00:41:09 - 00:41:12] um they came in they
[00:41:12 - 00:41:14] reviewed a tremendous amount of
[00:41:14 - 00:41:16] information they found some areas
[00:41:16 - 00:41:16] on websites that we needed
[00:41:16 - 00:41:19] to correct we have corrected
[00:41:19 - 00:41:21] those items um but we
[00:41:21 - 00:41:21] we did this in preparation
[00:41:23 - 00:41:23] because the state auditor's office
[00:41:23 - 00:41:26] will come in and do
[00:41:26 - 00:41:29] an audit of the institution
[00:41:29 - 00:41:29] for the same uh area
[00:41:29 - 00:41:31] so we wanted to make
[00:41:31 - 00:41:31] sure that we were um

[00:46:13 - 00:46:15] at the institution um they
[00:46:15 - 00:46:15] were able to pull the

[00:48:38 - 00:48:39] non-traditional students all of these
[00:48:39 - 00:48:42] are an effort to get
[00:48:42 - 00:48:42] better you see what progress
[00:48:42 - 00:48:43] is focused on as focused
[00:48:43 - 00:48:47] on as well um you
[00:48:47 - 00:48:48] also see what completion is
[00:48:49 - 00:48:49] focused on the student drop
[00:48:49 - 00:48:52] data and qualitative responses again
[00:48:52 - 00:48:53] we're focused on the communication
[00:48:53 - 00:48:55] needs of non-traditional students want
[00:48:55 - 00:48:57] to make sure that we're
[00:48:57 - 00:49:01] serving all of our students
[00:49:01 - 00:49:01] extremely well uh miss bell
[00:49:02 - 00:49:02] and her team continue to
[00:49:02 - 00:49:04] move forward with learning assessment
[00:49:04 - 00:49:07] outcomes assessment um and we're
[00:49:07 - 00:49:09] looking at a wellness check
[00:49:09 - 00:49:11] for general education that will
[00:49:11 - 00:49:11] be completed this spring uh
[00:49:13 - 00:49:13] and then entry student success
[00:49:14 - 00:49:14] initiatives that are being reviewed
[00:49:14 - 00:49:16] in the spring and so
[00:49:16 - 00:49:18] again cannot thank them enough
[00:49:18 - 00:49:18] for the great work that
[00:49:18 - 00:49:20] they do want to touch
[00:49:20 - 00:49:23] a little bit on enrollment
[00:49:23 - 00:49:23] um so this is fall
[00:49:26 - 00:49:26] data we saw i'll remind
[00:49:26 - 00:49:29] everyone it seems so long
[00:49:29 - 00:49:29] ago but in the fall
[00:49:29 - 00:49:31] of 20 we had a
[00:49:31 - 00:49:33] significant hit to enrollment due
[00:49:33 - 00:49:33] to the pandemic in the
[00:49:35 - 00:49:35] fall of 21 we saw
[00:49:35 - 00:49:38] another um hit to enrollment
[00:49:38 - 00:49:38] not quite as large but
[00:49:38 - 00:49:40] in the fall of 22
[00:49:40 - 00:49:40] we started to see it
[00:49:41 - 00:49:41] reverse and we've seen and
[00:49:41 - 00:49:44] we've worked really hard um
[00:49:44 - 00:49:44] all of us led by
[00:49:44 - 00:49:47] dr mia and his team
[00:49:47 - 00:49:49] of ensuring that enrollment continues
[00:49:49 - 00:49:49] to come back so we
[00:49:49 - 00:49:53] saw about a 1 gain
[00:49:53 - 00:49:53] in the fall of 22
[00:49:53 - 00:49:55] uh a 2 gain in
[00:49:55 - 00:49:55] the fall of 23 uh
[00:49:55 - 00:49:58] about a half gain in
[00:49:58 - 00:49:58] the fall of 24 and
[00:49:58 - 00:50:01] let me share that this
[00:50:01 - 00:50:01] spring we saw a 5
[00:50:03 - 00:50:03] increase in enrollment this spring
[00:50:03 - 00:50:05] so that is a that
[00:50:05 - 00:50:05] to me is a really
[00:50:05 - 00:50:07] good sign i'm hopeful that
[00:50:07 - 00:50:10] that will carry into into
[00:50:10 - 00:50:10] summer and fall but we're
[00:50:12 - 00:50:12] seeing um not only career
[00:50:12 - 00:50:14] technical programs we saw a
[00:50:14 - 00:50:16] significant increase in our academic
[00:50:16 - 00:50:19] transfer programs as well so
[00:50:19 - 00:50:19] it's good to see that
[00:50:19 - 00:50:21] i get a little nervous
[00:50:21 - 00:50:24] because community college enrollment traditionally
[00:50:24 - 00:50:26] has a um direct relationship
[00:50:26 - 00:50:26] with the economy and so
[00:50:26 - 00:50:28] if enrollment's starting to build
[00:50:28 - 00:50:30] back i worry that the
[00:50:30 - 00:50:30] economy might be a little
[00:50:33 - 00:50:33] weak um but i will
[00:50:33 - 00:50:35] take the enrollment so certainly
[00:50:35 - 00:50:35] excited about that um and
[00:50:37 - 00:50:37] we're also seeing our success
[00:50:37 - 00:50:41] rates get back to prepandemic
[00:50:41 - 00:50:43] levels um so um persistence
[00:50:43 - 00:50:43] from fall to spring went
[00:50:47 - 00:50:47] from 77 to 78 to
[00:50:47 - 00:50:47] 81 so great work by
[00:50:50 - 00:50:50] our faculty our staff everyone
[00:50:50 - 00:50:52] at the institution who continues
[00:50:52 - 00:50:54] to focus on this incredibly
[00:50:54 - 00:50:54] important it is a this
[00:50:54 - 00:50:55] incredibly important it is a
[00:50:55 - 00:50:58] legislative legislative session uh so
[00:50:58 - 00:50:58] i want to provide some
[00:50:59 - 00:50:59] state and legislative updates to
[00:51:00 - 00:51:03] you all uh the first
[00:51:03 - 00:51:03] is dr win roser uh
[00:51:05 - 00:51:05] dr win roser is the
[00:51:05 - 00:51:08] new commissioner of higher education
[00:51:08 - 00:51:10] got appointed in um late
[00:51:10 - 00:51:10] december uh started officially in
[00:51:13 - 00:51:13] january i i don't i
[00:51:13 - 00:51:14] i i i'm sure i
[00:51:16 - 00:51:16] shared with you i was
[00:51:16 - 00:51:18] asked to serve on the
[00:51:18 - 00:51:18] advisory committee so um jay
[00:51:21 - 00:51:21] hartzell the former president of
[00:51:21 - 00:51:23] ut austin myself and and
[00:51:23 - 00:51:26] james hallmark uh the vice
[00:51:26 - 00:51:29] chancellor of academic affairs for
[00:51:29 - 00:51:29] the m system uh we
[00:51:29 - 00:51:30] served with the chair of
[00:51:30 - 00:51:31] the coordinating board the vice
[00:51:31 - 00:51:34] chair and the secretary we
[00:51:34 - 00:51:34] recruited uh we did our
[00:51:37 - 00:51:37] best to recruit um individuals
[00:51:37 - 00:51:39] to serve as commissioner or
[00:51:39 - 00:51:42] to consider serving as commissioner
[00:51:42 - 00:51:42] i did reach out to
[00:51:42 - 00:51:44] dr roser we have a
[00:51:44 - 00:51:46] long history he knows our
[00:51:46 - 00:51:46] institution well he's a deep
[00:51:49 - 00:51:49] thinker and has was a
[00:51:49 - 00:51:51] longtime uh university administrator he
[00:51:51 - 00:51:53] knows the college very well
[00:51:53 - 00:51:55] and he knows community colleges
[00:51:55 - 00:51:55] very well he was one
[00:51:55 - 00:51:57] of our commencement speakers back
[00:51:57 - 00:52:01] in i think 2014 um
[00:52:01 - 00:52:01] let me also provide dr
[00:52:01 - 00:52:03] roser a lot of kudos
[00:52:03 - 00:52:03] this is a real calling
[00:52:03 - 00:52:07] for him he took a
[00:52:07 - 00:52:07] 40 pay cut to serve
[00:52:07 - 00:52:09] as commissioner of higher education
[00:52:09 - 00:52:11] it's our it's my expectation
[00:52:11 - 00:52:13] that uh my colleagues and
[00:52:13 - 00:52:13] i as well as everyone
[00:52:13 - 00:52:15] we help him be successful
[00:52:15 - 00:52:17] uh and we're going to
[00:52:17 - 00:52:17] continue to move forward but
[00:52:19 - 00:52:19] he has hit the ground
[00:52:19 - 00:52:22] running um in a legislative
[00:52:22 - 00:52:22] session and so he's doing
[00:52:22 - 00:52:24] a great job i'm certainly
[00:52:24 - 00:52:27] excited about that um i'd
[00:52:27 - 00:52:27] remind you the the themes
[00:52:30 - 00:52:30] that came out of house
[00:52:30 - 00:52:32] bill 8 um from the
[00:52:32 - 00:52:32] 2023 session were funding for
[00:52:34 - 00:52:38] outcomes affordability for students and
[00:52:38 - 00:52:38] investments in capacity um the
[00:52:38 - 00:52:40] key components of house bill
[00:52:40 - 00:52:42] 8 were fast our financial
[00:52:42 - 00:52:45] aid for swift transfer shared
[00:52:45 - 00:52:49] services performance tier which is
[00:52:49 - 00:52:49] 100 of our funding so
[00:52:49 - 00:52:51] 95 of the state's funding
[00:52:51 - 00:52:54] is performance tier but for
[00:52:54 - 00:52:54] epcc it's 100 of our
[00:52:54 - 00:52:57] funding base tier is 5
[00:52:57 - 00:52:57] for the 22 colleges that
[00:52:57 - 00:52:59] are small that don't have
[00:52:59 - 00:53:02] significant tax bases so that
[00:53:02 - 00:53:04] gets distributed to them and
[00:53:04 - 00:53:04] then finally the community college
[00:53:06 - 00:53:06] standing advisory committee um i'm
[00:53:06 - 00:53:08] the inaugural chair i'll serve
[00:53:08 - 00:53:10] in that capacity until next
[00:53:10 - 00:53:12] year and then they'll move
[00:53:12 - 00:53:15] forward with another chair our
[00:53:15 - 00:53:15] our focus areas for this
[00:53:15 - 00:53:17] session were the first the
[00:53:17 - 00:53:20] supplemental appropriations request so we
[00:53:20 - 00:53:23] have a dynamic system so
[00:53:23 - 00:53:25] we get funded on projections
[00:53:25 - 00:53:26] here's how you we think
[00:53:27 - 00:53:27] you're going to do based
[00:53:27 - 00:53:30] on what you've done and
[00:53:30 - 00:53:30] then we have a settle
[00:53:30 - 00:53:33] process on actuals here's how
[00:53:33 - 00:53:35] well you did do you
[00:53:35 - 00:53:35] does the state owe you
[00:53:35 - 00:53:38] money do you owe the
[00:53:38 - 00:53:38] state money back so the
[00:53:38 - 00:53:40] first thing was supplemental appropriations
[00:53:43 - 00:53:43] piece so the colleges the
[00:53:43 - 00:53:45] 50 colleges we thought we
[00:53:45 - 00:53:45] were going to need an
[00:53:48 - 00:53:48] additional 38 to 40 million
[00:53:48 - 00:53:50] then our expectation got to
[00:53:50 - 00:53:52] about 48 million when all
[00:53:52 - 00:53:52] of the outcomes for the
[00:53:52 - 00:53:54] 50 colleges came forward were
[00:53:54 - 00:53:58] certified by the state the
[00:53:58 - 00:53:58] state owed us 89 5
[00:54:01 - 00:54:01] million uh and by by
[00:54:01 - 00:54:04] us the 50 colleges not
[00:54:04 - 00:54:07] us individually i wish um
[00:54:07 - 00:54:07] but we performed well we
[00:54:07 - 00:54:08] performed well and i asked
[00:54:08 - 00:54:10] vice president flores to let
[00:54:10 - 00:54:10] me know when that money
[00:54:10 - 00:54:13] was wired to the college
[00:54:13 - 00:54:13] but we we got about
[00:54:13 - 00:54:16] a 4 million um wire
[00:54:16 - 00:54:16] to the college based on
[00:54:18 - 00:54:18] the actual outcomes that you
[00:54:18 - 00:54:21] all produced so that was
[00:54:21 - 00:54:23] the first thing we needed
[00:54:23 - 00:54:26] that supplemental appropriations requests approved
[00:54:26 - 00:54:27] second thing is full funding
[00:54:27 - 00:54:30] for the next bianium so
[00:54:30 - 00:54:32] the coordinating board based on
[00:54:32 - 00:54:32] our outcomes has projected that
[00:54:32 - 00:54:35] we will see the sector
[00:54:35 - 00:54:37] about a 5 increase in
[00:54:37 - 00:54:37] outcomes which means an additional
[00:54:42 - 00:54:42] 140 million to the 2
[00:54:42 - 00:54:44] 2 billion that's distributed to
[00:54:44 - 00:54:46] the 50 community colleges so
[00:54:46 - 00:54:48] that is moving forward there's
[00:54:48 - 00:54:48] two companion bills that i'll
[00:54:50 - 00:54:50] touch on shortly um that
[00:54:50 - 00:54:53] are moving that forward and
[00:54:53 - 00:54:53] then again you've heard me
[00:54:55 - 00:54:55] say this repeatedly we needed
[00:54:55 - 00:54:59] to make sure um that
[00:54:59 - 00:54:59] the uh uh that private
[00:55:02 - 00:55:02] institutions were part of this
[00:55:02 - 00:55:04] in texas that transfers to
[00:55:04 - 00:55:06] private institutions baylor for mlennon
[00:55:06 - 00:55:08] community college etc so that
[00:55:08 - 00:55:12] is moving forward um we're
[00:55:12 - 00:55:14] continuing uh to work on
[00:55:14 - 00:55:14] on uh to scale workforce
[00:55:16 - 00:55:18] partnerships that's incredibly important again
[00:55:18 - 00:55:19] we're doing a great job
[00:55:19 - 00:55:19] of that that's why our
[00:55:19 - 00:55:22] career technical education programs continue
[00:55:22 - 00:55:24] to increase um but we're
[00:55:24 - 00:55:27] also looking at um skills
[00:55:27 - 00:55:30] development fund increases as well
[00:55:30 - 00:55:30] as jet our jobs and
[00:55:30 - 00:55:33] education for texans increases as
[00:55:33 - 00:55:34] well as true uh texas
[00:55:34 - 00:55:37] reskilling and upskilling through education
[00:55:37 - 00:55:39] uh state agency workforce credentials
[00:55:39 - 00:55:39] we're continuing to look at
[00:55:41 - 00:55:41] those and ensuring that we're
[00:55:41 - 00:55:43] requiring the right credential to
[00:55:43 - 00:55:45] work in these and we
[00:55:45 - 00:55:45] have a partnership with the
[00:55:45 - 00:55:48] state on that and then
[00:55:48 - 00:55:48] we need to make sure
[00:55:49 - 00:55:49] that we have access to
[00:55:49 - 00:55:52] clinical rotations there was a
[00:55:52 - 00:55:54] lot of private schools that
[00:55:54 - 00:55:54] were coming in and we
[00:55:54 - 00:55:56] were they were offering to
[00:55:56 - 00:55:59] pay the hospitals for the
[00:55:59 - 00:55:59] clinical rotation sites uh so
[00:56:02 - 00:56:02] there's legislation to mitigate that
[00:56:02 - 00:56:04] uh so that the public
[00:56:04 - 00:56:06] uh institutions colleges and universities
[00:56:06 - 00:56:09] has have access to those
[00:56:09 - 00:56:09] as well i'm only going
[00:56:11 - 00:56:11] to talk about three bills
[00:56:11 - 00:56:13] two are really good bills
[00:56:13 - 00:56:16] house bill 2110 and senate
[00:56:16 - 00:56:16] bill 1786 these are companion
[00:56:18 - 00:56:18] bills these are the house
[00:56:18 - 00:56:21] bill 8 cleanup bills so
[00:56:21 - 00:56:23] they they do good things
[00:56:23 - 00:56:23] and they do some things
[00:56:23 - 00:56:27] that we i'm got to
[00:56:27 - 00:56:27] be very transparent about so
[00:56:29 - 00:56:29] they clean up some of
[00:56:29 - 00:56:31] those the private school transfers
[00:56:31 - 00:56:31] um all of those kinds
[00:56:35 - 00:56:35] of things but they also
[00:56:35 - 00:56:37] um when we started this
[00:56:37 - 00:56:37] in the 23 session we
[00:56:37 - 00:56:40] were looking at a 10-year
[00:56:40 - 00:56:42] window and all of our
[00:56:42 - 00:56:42] credentials had a return on
[00:56:45 - 00:56:45] investment in those 10 years
[00:56:47 - 00:56:47] well we're revising and we're
[00:56:48 - 00:56:48] continuing to work on this
[00:56:48 - 00:56:51] formula and so now that's
[00:56:51 - 00:56:51] going to be five years
[00:56:51 - 00:56:54] for the associates degrees do
[00:56:54 - 00:56:56] students see a return on
[00:56:56 - 00:56:58] investment within five years and
[00:56:58 - 00:57:01] they there's a complicated formula
[00:57:01 - 00:57:01] looks at aid that students
[00:57:02 - 00:57:02] receive but also looks at
[00:57:02 - 00:57:06] what high school diploma earners
[00:57:06 - 00:57:09] earn statewide average and the
[00:57:09 - 00:57:13] investment or the the program
[00:57:13 - 00:57:13] has to show that it
[00:57:13 - 00:57:16] is a um hold my
[00:57:16 - 00:57:16] if it's for me i'm
[00:57:16 - 00:57:19] not available um but we
[00:57:19 - 00:57:19] have to we have to
[00:57:19 - 00:57:22] show uh that the these
[00:57:22 - 00:57:22] degree earners earn at least
[00:57:26 - 00:57:26] 30 000 which is the
[00:57:26 - 00:57:28] statewide average so i'm going
[00:57:28 - 00:57:28] to share with you we're
[00:57:29 - 00:57:29] going to see a number
[00:57:29 - 00:57:31] of associate degrees that are
[00:57:31 - 00:57:36] going to fall from funding
[00:57:36 - 00:57:36] so about um 16 sip
[00:57:36 - 00:57:38] codes and they don't quite
[00:57:38 - 00:57:40] make it within that 5-year
[00:57:40 - 00:57:40] time frame we're not going
[00:57:40 - 00:57:42] to stop offering those we're
[00:57:42 - 00:57:44] going to work harder on
[00:57:44 - 00:57:44] a couple of things we'll
[00:57:46 - 00:57:46] still receive credit if the
[00:57:46 - 00:57:48] student transfers so we want
[00:57:48 - 00:57:50] to make sure that they
[00:57:50 - 00:57:50] transfer uh and we're going
[00:57:50 - 00:57:53] to try to work as
[00:57:53 - 00:57:53] a sector to improve and
[00:57:55 - 00:57:55] finish get those students to
[00:57:55 - 00:57:57] finish faster um and so
[00:57:57 - 00:57:58] that's what we're going to
[00:57:58 - 00:57:58] work on with those areas
[00:57:58 - 00:58:01] and it's a fluid system
[00:58:01 - 00:58:01] so if next year all
[00:58:03 - 00:58:03] of a sudden we see
[00:58:03 - 00:58:05] that those areas are going
[00:58:05 - 00:58:05] less than five years they'll
[00:58:05 - 00:58:09] come back to the funding
[00:58:09 - 00:58:11] mechanism now i've also shared
[00:58:11 - 00:58:11] with dr smith and his
[00:58:11 - 00:58:14] team that short-term credentials by
[00:58:14 - 00:58:16] 2027 session we're going to
[00:58:16 - 00:58:18] have a time frame that
[00:58:18 - 00:58:20] we'll look at those short-term
[00:58:20 - 00:58:20] credentials to see if those
[00:58:22 - 00:58:22] are paying off for those
[00:58:22 - 00:58:24] students um whether they're level
[00:58:24 - 00:58:27] one certificates or osas and
[00:58:29 - 00:58:29] iclc's so those are the
[00:58:29 - 00:58:33] that's the good bill um
[00:58:33 - 00:58:33] a bill of concern for
[00:58:33 - 00:58:37] me is senate bill 37
[00:58:37 - 00:58:37] it's it's it has significant
[00:58:37 - 00:58:39] concern for me it actually
[00:58:39 - 00:58:42] has significant concern for the
[00:58:42 - 00:58:42] board as well um what
[00:58:45 - 00:58:45] senate bill 37 aims it
[00:58:45 - 00:58:49] what its goal is it
[00:58:49 - 00:58:49] aims to shift power from
[00:58:49 - 00:58:52] faculty to governing boards i
[00:58:52 - 00:58:54] can assure you dr bham
[00:58:54 - 00:58:54] that judge hagerty and his
[00:58:56 - 00:58:56] colleagues they don't want that
[00:58:56 - 00:58:57] colleagues they don't want that
[00:58:58 - 00:59:01] responsibility responsibility um this from
[00:59:01 - 00:59:01] my perspective is very much
[00:59:04 - 00:59:04] going from local control to
[00:59:04 - 00:59:05] controlling going from local control
[00:59:05 - 00:59:08] to controlling the the locals
[00:59:08 - 00:59:08] um i i i have
[00:59:08 - 00:59:10] real concerns it shifts a
[00:59:10 - 00:59:13] lot of responsibilities from our
[00:59:13 - 00:59:13] faculty senate um to the
[00:59:13 - 00:59:15] governing board and to me
[00:59:15 - 00:59:18] i don't want that responsibility
[00:59:18 - 00:59:18] uh i don't want to
[00:59:18 - 00:59:20] say dr burnham you're the
[00:59:20 - 00:59:22] chair of faculty senate that's
[00:59:22 - 00:59:22] what the bill says that
[00:59:22 - 00:59:24] i would have to pick
[00:59:24 - 00:59:27] the officers um that's that
[00:59:27 - 00:59:27] to me is not my
[00:59:29 - 00:59:29] responsibility that to me is
[00:59:29 - 00:59:31] the faculty's responsibility i can
[00:59:31 - 00:59:33] assure you regardless of the
[00:59:33 - 00:59:36] outcome of senate bill 37
[00:59:36 - 00:59:36] that dr smith and i
[00:59:36 - 00:59:39] have a firm belief in
[00:59:39 - 00:59:40] shared governance the board understands
[00:59:40 - 00:59:42] that belief in shared governance
[00:59:42 - 00:59:42] and the college will continue
[00:59:45 - 00:59:45] to move forward in that
[00:59:45 - 00:59:48] fashion we will comply with
[00:59:48 - 00:59:52] whatever laws passed but we're
[00:59:52 - 00:59:52] hopeful that this gets mitigated
[00:59:53 - 00:59:53] um a little bit about
[00:59:53 - 00:59:55] the community college sector we
[00:59:55 - 00:59:57] are once again the largest
[00:59:57 - 00:59:57] sector of higher education in
[00:59:59 - 00:59:59] the state of texas so
[00:59:59 - 01:00:02] we've recovered a lot we're
[01:00:02 - 01:00:02] not quite to where we
[01:00:02 - 01:00:04] were in 19 but we've
[01:00:04 - 01:00:06] recovered a lot amongst the
[01:00:06 - 01:00:09] 50 community colleges we're well
[01:00:09 - 01:00:09] over 700 000 students we
[01:00:09 - 01:00:11] awarded the latest data available
[01:00:11 - 01:00:15] well over 125 000 degrees
[01:00:15 - 01:00:16] and certificates uh and we
[01:00:16 - 01:00:20] provide 96 of all of
[01:00:20 - 01:00:22] the state's cte credentials so
[01:00:22 - 01:00:25] the texas state technical colleges
[01:00:25 - 01:00:27] and the lamars they provide
[01:00:27 - 01:00:27] the state 4 of those
[01:00:29 - 01:00:29] credentials so we need to
[01:00:29 - 01:00:31] make sure that our legislature
[01:00:31 - 01:00:34] understands us and that the
[01:00:34 - 01:00:34] role that we play in
[01:00:34 - 01:00:36] the state so we've made
[01:00:36 - 01:00:39] sure that they understand that
[01:00:39 - 01:00:39] now it wouldn't be uh
[01:00:39 - 01:00:42] appropriate if i didn't at
[01:00:42 - 01:00:42] least acknowledge some um if
[01:00:42 - 01:00:43] i didn't at least acknowledge
[01:00:44 - 01:00:48] some um recognitions recognitions so
[01:00:48 - 01:00:48] first uh the vi campus
