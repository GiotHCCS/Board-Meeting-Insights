mckin mcintyre thank you managing director of hilltop securities asset management llc will present the endowment fund investment strategy welcome sir welcome sir thank you let us see is this going to appear or do i need to do aha okay all right and just so you guys know there is a lot going on in the market right now

there is a lot going on in the economy right now there was some concern rightfully so that inflation was going to spike and yields moved a little bit higher on that and the fed is on hold because there is so much uncertainty and there is been a real turn in terms of expectations for the economy now investors

in the market are positioning themselves for recession and that is related entirely to the tariff threat to be honest with you nothing else there is a lot of uncertainty with businesses right now if you were a business you would be disincined to spend and invest and buy new equipment as a consumer you are worried about your job

you are concerned basically about the economy going forward so you are not spending there is a lot going on we also have the businesses have imported a tremendous amount in front of tariffs and exports have also fallen and all of those together and of course government spending has also been reduced in the first quarter all those together

mean that economic growth right now is trending according to the atlanta fed gdp now measure at negative one eight i do not think it is going to be negative for the first quarter when all said and done when all the numbers are in but definitely has been a slowdown in the economy so interest rates are not too

far off from where they were u the fed again is on hold the expectation is at some point they will more likely cut rates in the second half of the year than raise rates but the fed does not know what it is going to do so it is going to have to take a cue from the administration

as will the rest of the world as far as the endowment is me this is this is this is actually helpful there is a there is a bloomberg survey that comes out once a month where they survey 80 odd economists well 80 economists not odd economists and i think it is really interesting if you look at gdp

expectations for the next six quarters the economists do not know either so they are all gluming around this central tendency of two growth and that goes out for almost two years the unemployment rate they expect it is currently at four one they expect it'll move up to four two that really is kind of a bailout in my

opinion they are basically not wanting to make a prediction they believe the fed will cut rates starting in the summer and cut by a quarter point in the third quarter and a quarter point in the fourth quarter and then it'll basically stay near three and a half i think all of that could change within a day or

a week so i would not put a whole lot of stock in that i do think that holy smokes get into the investment strategy what we want to do even though rates have been generally staying put and we have had some issues with the safekeeping agent getting everything set up i believe that things are set up at

this point so this is going to look somewhat similar to what i presented the last time what i would like to do is invest these monies out along the curve so that we can lock in the cash flow to be able to fund your scholarships going forward and to the extent that is possible i would like to

see most of that placed out longer on the curve so retaining one five million in investment pools or liquid products i understand that liquid pool rate will generally fall but i like the idea of having some of this liquid because we are not going to know where things are going to go and obviously you are going to

have some scholarships to fund initially twelve million out in two million blocks going out six to seven years the estimated yield there is about four and a quarter twelve million out in the five to sixyear range estimated yield of about 415 three million out in the four to five year range with an estimated yield of four and

three million out in the three to four year range with an estimated yield of just about four this moves around a lot it is actually a little bit higher today than it was when i put this together obviously the higher yields the more you are going to have in terms of income spun off of that will allow

you to fund scholarships this is a conservative approach you are not going to be in full faith in credit treasuries instead of you know other things we feel like this is the best approach we do not believe that this puts the principle at risk in any way and all of these treasuries will have coupons that pay every

six months so despite the fact that the securities will be placed out in a ladder going out from roughly three to seven years you will get coupon payments regularly that will allow you to be able to fund the scholarships that you are intending to fund so i think that pretty much wraps it up i recognize that you

guys might have some questions this is generally a pretty simple straightforward conservative as it should be for your conservative as it should be for your endowment strategy yes sir okay let us take the first the third point purchase twelve million us traders securities in blocks of pro now you do not mean that you are going to make

one bond purchase for two million is this you are going to make an aggregate of bonds that will work up to two million are you going to is does this say i am going to make one two million purchase they would be two million blocks so you would have that would be one purchase so in the case

of this six to seven years we'd make six purchases in that sector probably you know roughly every two months so that would be spread out but yes that is the intent so they would be they would be a two million i mean a single bond of two million so that when you say a block that is essentially

the size do we have any other questions no we are good thank you okay thank you sir i appreciate the information of course of course thank you all very much yes dr graham yes sir i would just add that this meets part of the requirement in the resolution for presenting to the board the investment strategy for the

student success endowment fund so mr mcintyre was presenting the proposed investment strategy as required in the resolution the next step will be at the next board meeting will bring forward a request for an action if you all are in favor of to vote on accepting this investment stat strategy as required by the resolution thank you and how

often will we get this update sir so this update right now per the resolution there is an annual update that is required in september every september the investment strategy and how it is doing will be presented to the board along with the composition of the portfolio and the performance of the portfolio so that is will be presented

every september if you require more updates we would be happy to provide that anytime you want okay item one seven two dr william sarata college president will recognize individuals who have retired from el dr graham and members of the board as i have expressed in the past it is always bittersweet to see our employees reach this phase

everybody to go so good afternoon everybody chair hagerty dr sarata board members colleagues community members i am happy to join you all this afternoon to provide you all with an enrollment update for the spring 2025 semester and to share a few division initiatives that support our enrollment and student success goals i am going to note because i

am coming from student enrollment services that this work is a collegewide work right enrollment we refer to your messaging a lot dr graham that we are all recruiters we are all responsible for enrollment at the college so it is the daily work of the faculty staff leadership my cabinet colleagues their respective division leadership dr sarata's leadership and

support and guidance provided by the board of trustees that contribute to the results we see today so dr saratas just spoiled my surprise but i am just kidding so i figured i was going to start with this right we are going to kick off by sharing this great news this spring enrollment is showing a five increase over

2024 we are up over 24 zero student students as of last week which is really great and i put that little applause emoji not expecting the audience to applaud or anything but or to think about that right i thank you you are applauding for yourselves and all the good work that you are doing so if you look

at the enrollment figure up there what you can see is this is showing the different student types our continuing students represent 54 of our enrollment and then early college high school pek and dual credit enrollment represent another 39 so the majority of our enrollment goes to continuing students and early college pek and dual credit enrollment if we

continue looking at student type you could see we have significant gains in continuing educa continuing students which is a marker that we always look at so those are students that are already enrolled at the college and what they are doing is they are showing us that the good work that our faculty and staff are doing merits them

returning so up you know almost 400 students over the previous semester we also see strong enrollment in dual credit early college high school petac etc so we are doing really well in these individual areas and we continue to see that we are providing great opportunities for the students out at the isds if we just look at what

spring enrollment has looked like over the past four semesters we can look at this trend and see that from spring 2022 up till now we keep seeing that increased till now we keep seeing that increased enrollment 22 46 in 22 up to 24 six students as of 22 46 in 22 up to 24 six students as of

spring 2025 we had just started our new or we are just starting our new semester so the number has increased a little bit since then breaking this down by campus enrollment likewise we are looking at this spring and you could see for the most part our campuses are showing great improvement look at trans mountain at twelve up

mission el paso at seven up and then dual credit early college pek at fourteen up so we are seeing significant and online also growing so up one we are seeing significant improvement across seeing significant improvement across our campuses in looking at how our students are enrolling full-time enrollment grew by over four in 2024 those are the shorter

the bars the teal bars that is a great indicator because we want our students to try to attend full-time we know that full-time enrollment contributes to student success we also know that the majority of our students attend are part-time and we still see 2024 our major type we are seeing this is really concurrent this is this is

a great example we have five increase in both academic and technical enrollment which matches our five growth and then by degree type we are seeing gains in associate of applied science which is on the far left associate of arts up by nine because we continue to see that growth in the early college area and those are the

awards those stu or those are the majors those students are signing up for associate of arts and teaching associate of science you can see continues to decrease it is been a steady decrease ten over the last year over the last four years certificate of completions continue to increase and that undeclared is up by a few students so

it is very few students so a small number makes that percentage grow so we try to get the students to declare to say what they are going to want to study but i always think those students have a lot of opportunities they are not quite sure what they are going to do and we will get them on

a pathway shortly in instructional mode i think this is a really great one and that the deans can attest to and anybody who is been on the campuses is that you see the parking lots a lot fuller you see people walking around you see a lot more life and the students are voting that way in those face-to-face

classes so we see up six face toface and six hybrid and that is a testament to the work that is going on at the mission daso campus with the 8week sections the increase in hybrid classes and then online you could see not as high as where we were in 22 but a slight increase over the previous year

and then in age groups this is a really interesting one too that we get to see that this is also a very recent phenomenon where we see all the age groups you can see our bread and butter is on the far left side of the of the figure but we did see a gain in enrollment in all

the age groups to all the for all the students that we serve and then wrapping up this enrollment report is what is the most challenging item for students it is how to pay for school and one of the things that you are going to notice is well let us think back last year last year there was the

big fafsa issue delays challenges with when it was going to come out and not understanding the new processes it was the new form this past year a little bit of a delay but i am going to give a lot of credit here we have have a great leader in our financial aid and veteran affairs area missy nes

lopez who steered the ship made sure that we served our students properly and they never had those big hiccups and you can see that in that table there is two rows that pell grants offered you can see continues to grow all students graduating from high school are required to complete a fafsa as a as a graduation requirement

and then they submit a tpcc and utp as well so we get a lot of students submitting them to us the important line is the second one the pel grants paid and you can see it increasing every year a significant jump this past year almost 23 million paid out which represents a three million over three million increase

from the previous year sixteen difference from the previous year which far exceeds the five enrollment increase so our students need this aid we can see 88 of our students receive financial aid and this is demonstrating that we are helping them get that aid as they need it so that wraps up just the basic enrollment you can look

at the numbers but then you would ask me i will anticipate this right you would say so what do we do to support this enrollment and i told you know it is a collegewide effort but i will speak to a few things and this is division of student and enrollment services my division it is big but i

am not going to go through that whole list i will just highlight a few of the areas that i think really stand out or make a big impact i will start since i ended with financial aid i will start with financial aid so as i mentioned this area is directed by miss lopez executive director of student financial

aid and veterans affairs and so we get out in the community and this is just one example this past spring we typically do it in the fall but because of the delay in the fafsa we did it in the spring we work along with our partners at the university of texas at el paso and texas tech and

we hold 54 different fafsa night events that means these are in the evening our we send teams out to these schools and they meet with the community directly so they are there to assist the students and their families importantly navigate the financial aid process it ran from the end of january to the end of february and then

it all wraps up we just wrapped it up this past saturday and this is really excuse me also a story of partnerships i mentioned our higher ed partners also education service center region nineteen we they host us at the boeing office this past saturday where we open up this financial aid workshop to the entire el paso community

and our specialists and also from the other schools come together and assist these families so it was a great event and we are going to continue doing this and i will let you know also is something happened that day where we have these financial aid experts from these three institutions sitting down looking at the data trying to

solve these problems and see how we can better serve our students continuing with this this is the area that maybe most of you all are familiar with and that is the recruitment services led by our director of recruitment services mr michael talamantes who is done a fantastic job you can see the list of items under his area

i am not going to even go through them all but i will tell you he is brought the college together through the epcc recruitment network he is held our signature epcc roundup event which is our parent focused event hosted this past year this past spring at the sooto independent school district d district service center open to everybody

so we give credit another example of our partnerships it is open to the entire el paso community where we bring all our services plus opportunities for students he is also run several open houses so you can talk to the deans health and cte earlier this year nursing the steam open house at vay verde the welcome days as

students return every semester so we are out and about as well as messaging students so we have the ability to text message students through student bridge and have a call center for making calls to reach out to them as well our admissions and registration department run by executive director cassandra lachica chavez dr lachica chavez does an amazing

job because she not only oversees that area but also the dual credit early college and pek enrollment on the student services side likewise students have a requirement to submit an apply texas application upon graduation before graduation so we you can see i just gave you some numbers of the amount of applications that we process and what we

do we are that front-facing direct connection with the student and processing their application and their enrollment so customer service is number one but really in this area what i wanted to do is focus on some of the work that we are doing internally so we have worked with ap fernandez and his team to develop this epcc dual

credit early college k through twelve app we have a relatively small team five specialists admission specialists dedicated to processing the 39 of enrollment that we have from dual credit early college and pek and so you can imagine the school districts have to send us rosters and it is a lot of manual processes we are working to automate

processes we are working to automate that have the team from it assisting with that so we are in version two zero version three zero is coming up very quickly that is going to connect everything to banner and let students register so we are seeing good things happen and then finally i am going to wrap it up here

which is what is going on right now our signature premier enrollment initiative for firsttime in college students so i have presented to the board before but i know we have mr mendes i might have shared this when i in the during the board orientation but this is when we get out to all the school districts so we

are going to have 22 events we kicked it off this past monday we are already at harmony charter and they and they bust in al pastor leadership academy and idea schools that was monday yesterday we were at fabins and then tornneo and sanelli visited fabins today we are at jefferson and burgess and silva magnet visited and tomorrow

we are at soooro high school and you could see all the dates so we have after tomorrow we will have eighteen more dates left so nineteen dates left this is really a road show we take our first year experience so thank you very much to sandra duhan and her team dr mitchell supporting that that advises the students

then they see our admissions team they see our financial aid team new student orientation recruitment runs it all and students leave here's the great thing they leave that day hopefully with a full-time schedule in hand ready for the fall semester so lots of great things going on at the college lots of enrollment and initiatives we are always

happy to take your advice any items that you might suggest anything that you think that we can do to get out in the community or help improve our enrollment thank you for all your all your support and i will turn it over for any questions i do not have much of a question but i'd like to congratulate

you all it is an excellent teamwork i seeing it as a team and i know mr talamantes and you know i will call him with a short notice and he'll show up with his with his team you know to certain events that i did not realize nobody had mentioned but that is great to see the effort one

question i do have is are we sending any letters like to the juniors or the sophomores to let them know that because again we are all recruiters but i think we need to start recruiting at prek kinder so that you know they can be headed in our direction but because some of the people that i talked to

get all excited because they get a letter from some college do we do any of those anymore well we have we do not send direct letters that is a great idea we do have communication with the schools in the high school because we work directly with their college and career readiness specialists or you know those that whole

group we do have a crm coming on board you all approved that just recently so that is going to assist us with our messaging and direct messaging to the students so that is coming soon and we you know i did not share that right now you mentioned reaching out to students in kindergarten under our recruitment area we

have our college readiness mentors and they work directly with the adopted schools so that group of adopted schools are really getting a lot of epcc and that is where i have seen some of the parents that come in with you know saying that their kid is going to go to epcc and there is events there where they

are coming in to sign up or something but they have the little ones with them and it is a great connection there for the little ones to see that the older ones are signing up for epcc absolutely i have one question yes sir can you please what slide was i looking at you are looking at next one

there was a you had some over to the side there was everything was a plus except i thought i saw a minus twelve yeah there is a couple early admission you can see down one student and what is the reason what what is the reason for that i do not know i mean it is one so the

numbers on the side represent we are down one student so there are very few students on that side these are students that apply that are in high school and are going to apply for early admission outside of their reg normal school district we have a few over here first time transfers that is a few students to 78

students down i would not be able to tell you the reason why we were down in those little in those couple of areas and little in those couple of areas and what is undetermined those are students who we do not know what it is or do not declare what where they are going to be so or what

type of student they are so we fix that later on we are able to identify these students but in this initial report they end up right there you got to put the first time transfer with the under and then it'll show a twelve with the under and then it'll show a twelve increase right i was just wondering

why it was a negative there and you have early admission minus six yeah one student down yes sir there are very few that is why it has such a big impact okay thank you you are welcome you did great work it is great yes thank you dr mike you are welcome okay i will let these guys do

mr hagerty hi section four financial services item four one discussion and action to approve an increase to weaver and tidwell llp for providing internal audit services to el paso community college in an additional amount of thirteen zero to previously approved amount of thirteen zero to previously approved 75 zero 75 zero move to approve but i do have

a move to approve but i do have a question i have a second okay go ahead with your question john did we get a clear idea as to why the increase dr sarata yeah i will ask mr flores to respond dr graham please vice president flores sure thank you dr sarata so weaver tidwell was employed in july

of 26 of 2024 and so their first assignment was to test our compliance with sb17 they completed that audit and presented to the board at the february board meeting the results of the sp17 audit there was still a remaining balance in the 75 zero annual budget amount so they began a study of risk assessment from which future

audit plans would be derived so they have conducted some initial training in january they provided a webinar to the cabinet members a one-hour webinar on risk assessment then in february they conducted a 4-hour workshop to the cabinet on developing risk assessment to complete that assignment for risk assessment evaluation we anticipate that there will be some more expenses

which thirteen zero would cover one of there so they are completing the risk assessment and then they are going to make a presentation to the board on the risk assessment review that they did and the audit plan which will guide the next three years of audits so hopefully there'll be savings there to recover the thirteen zero additional

hopefully as a result of their audits yes ma'am i have a question i guess i do not understand we had an initial project was approved for 75 zero and it was completed for less than 75 zero so we assumed a second responsibility that was not outlined and now we want to pay thirteen zero more for something that

was not in the original contract but we decided just to do it anyway did i miss something out of all this so the original contract runs from july 2024 to july 2025 those bridge what was the objective of that 75 zero what was that to cover to provide any audit services that the college may deem necessary okay

and risk assessment so you are piggybacking a new def an additional requirement of risk assessment onto the original contract that is correct sir yes i do have a question this is all put out to bid right these automatically you were awarded a 5-year contract with one-year annual renewals based upon satisfactory performance they did bid for it yes

sir absolutely all right just checking okay and there were a lot of respondents to that did you have any like areas that you were surprised when they did the risk assessment well the risk assessment is hugely comprehensive i think the cabinet members would attest to that it is a about eight-page document that identifies all the key areas

based upon weaver tidwell's experience in auditing that are potential areas for audit re risk and the cabinet rated them on probability and inherent risk and so as a result of all of those areas being rated dr graham over those seven pages they are working on a report as a result of that will inform the administration where the

highest areas of risk are the classic areas of course are security on in it security surrounding funds revenues those kind of things but their risk assessment is hugely comprehensive it is it was it was a 4-hour workshop each cabinet member provided input onto the weights associated with each of those each of those categories and so this is

how weaver tidwell is able to assess the institutional risk as a whole resulting from that based upon those weights then future audits will be those weights then future audits will be identified where did facilities fall into that risk management it was one of the areas so facilities presents its own challenges because of deferred maintenance that is one

of u there were about eight or nine categories under facilities contract and construction management is a it was a big item facilities maintenance deferred maintenance plans in the future how you maintain the grounds it is pretty extensive and we are going to get a report on that when they come back in so that report chair hagerty is

expected to be delivered to the board at the end of april okay provided that the board approves the increase today but it but it is you know i am not a i am not a contract specialist but it seems to me that if risk estimate is as you said such a huge element it seems to me that

it should have been identified there and if it if it is such a huge element and it hasn't been identified then i wonder how they are cap how capable they are of then not being able to forecast the need for something like an additional thirteen zero only six months ago it all of a sudden something huge all

of a sudden comes up we need thirteen zero that we did not anticipate but we are going to evaluate you on risk adjustment because we know what risks are but they could not risk their own program i do not i do not understand all of it so a lot of that was dependent on how much the sb17

audit would come out to had okay so we are saying that maybe they did not understand the sbc audit in the first place and so they were not able to properly risk that ultimately the sb17 cost of that audit was dependent on the extent of their review of our college and unique policies and procedures so is not

that a risk that is defined as a risk and they missed it so how good are they at risk adjustment if they cannot even figure out how much they are going to need to do what it is they said they were going to do i mean how much how i do not know i do not have any

more questions if they do not know what they are doing i do not know if i want to vote for thirteen zero for them to pay more to do something they could not do in the first place nor could they identify yeah the only thing i would respond mr structure is that sb17 was a new law that

passed in the 88th legislative session all institutions are conducting compliance audits are conducting compliance audits with sb17 i think it is dependent on it is something new that auditors were not familiar with and the level and depth of what is required with regards to sb17 was surprising to even some of us in the field as a new

law and that would be the explanation that i'd provide for them on the extent and how extensive they got into reviewing sb17 if you will recall they provided some examples of where initially there was evidence of non-compliance with sb17 that we then had to remove or change language to some of our websites some of our postings around

campus in some of the areas then they'd have to determine whether it was in conflict with federal law versus state law so i do give them a tiny bit of leeway with regards to sb17 sir well and it is a good thing that it took place because you will have a better idea the next time that there

is the same type of audit but move to approve i think we already did that did not we already do we did you had a second mrs robless i mr mendes i dr graham i mr hagerty i section five physical facilities there is none section six curriculum and instruction item six one discussion and action to affirm a

three-year contract with education to go ed to go a division of sgage learning inc to provide online continuing education courses in an amount not to exceed 80 zero per year they sure offer a lot of courses did we have these services dr graham we have had the contract with ediggo for quite a while i believe we started

that in 2018 do not quote me on that but we have had it for a very long time and it gives us the opportunity to they added more courses to it absolutely that is what i meant that now there is comprehensive like a lot more than comprehensive like a lot more than before and it allows us to

offer any number of courses that we do not have the capacity internally to offer mrs rob second mrs rob second any discussion call a question mr xer hi mrs robas i mr mendes hi dr graham hi mr hagerty i item six two discussion and action on the acceptance of a grant award from the texas mutual insurance company

in the amount of 100 zero move to approve six two and six three second read six three well was another grant item six three discussion and action on the acceptance of a grant award from the texas workforce commission twwc in the amount of 85 521 judge hagerty i'd obviously call on dr smith to provide credit for these

respective grants yes thank you thank you dr sata so those of us that are well read will see that this is the 11th year of our texas mutual grant and if my math is correct that brings us to one million of grants from texas mutual we have served over two twenty zero individuals in the community training them

on safety in the workplace all free of charge to those attendees so it is a great program and we certainly thank texas mutual in addition to of course ap blaine primizich and his crew jose kasa lopez i think they are in the audience and of course our grants office as well under bob elliot so great job there

the twwc grant is the first sbdc grant that we are having with bane construction so we are excited about that upskilling 102 different employees for them in our region so congratulations again to those same players that i just mentioned i got a question with dr is there any requirement do they just give you the money and let

you guys decide how to how to train or the only requirement is that it is for workforce safety that is all it is that is it yeah and so we have created the risk management institute here at the institution under the leadership of cesy mau and so she coordinates all the training and all the workshops and everything

for the community so most of the money goes to pay for the instructors and the equipment is pretty much yeah the sessions the space the instructors etc yeah there there is some supplies in addition okay thank you yes thank you any other questions did we get a a motion to mr dr gra all right call the question

mr hi mrs robless hi mr menddees hi dr graham i mr hagerty i section seven student services item seven one discussion and action on the approval of continuing education ce tuition rates for new education ce tuition rates for new courses move to approve move to approve second any discussion other questions mr uxer i mrs robas i mr

mendes i dr graham i mr hagerty i item seven two discussion and action on the approval of continuing education ce tuition rates for revised courses i have a motion move to approve second any discussion i have a quick question can you just tell what are these tuition rates how do they compare to you know inerson classes that

kind of thing i guess generally mr these are much lower tuition rates than we would charge for credit courses at the institution a lot of them are personal enrichment courses and we base that on we do not necessarily make money on these so we attempt to break even for the instructor costs and supplies etc and that is

why you will see in some of the notes that there is a break even number of students that we need okay so the purpose of this is community outreach as much as anything else yes sir and i say generally because oftentimes we will bring to the board new courses or revised courses that are applicable to training by

twwc etc those are charged at a little bit different rate okay how do we determine like which courses are going to be off offered in the children's college area because like robotics and you know some of the more innovative things yeah we try to monitor industry or community trends and mirror those and so we have a vast

history of what is made in the past and what sorts of things that students are interested in of course we have great partnerships with the isds as well so we kind of keep our finger on the pulse of what the community would like to see in regards to those things okay thank you any other questions call a
