of p ena bjones mcdaniel and co will present audit results regarding the student success endowment the student success endowment scholarship good afternoon everyone thank you for allowing me to present this where with painting of rionis mcdaniel as he said and we were charged to do what is called an agreed upon procedure the board a couple years ago

ordered that a student endowment success fund be created and then we ordered to look at the attributes that were challenged to the management and see if they were done and so what i have in front of you and do not worry i am not going to go through every word on every page but i'd like to just

give a quick synopsis of each of the directives the board said to do this did they do it the board just said to do that did they do that so i will quickly run through some of these but i will pay attention to one specific item of specific interest so first of all the student success endowment fund

on april 2023 the board directed the college to create a student success endowment fund the fund was created on may 28 25 the board of trustees received an amendment to that establishment and the amendment is required that the 90 of the original interest that was originally stated shall be used for scholarship to say shall be allocated to

scholarships so basically instead of ordering every year you have to do this every year we are going to allocate the interest to it and then secondly the amendment modified the original language to be to be directed at the discretion of the executive committee instead of bringing it to the full board so relieving the full board of that

requirement and both of those were done as required so moving on to the next one the establishment of the endowment the objective was to determine if the college did establish an endowment and the final observation was yes the student success endowment fund was created on august 30th of 2023 and that date does become important a little bit

later the next one were deposits of funds we are giving you 30 million the objective was to verify that 30 million was deposited into the student success endowment fund and what we did determine or identify is that the initial deposit into the endowment fund was made on august 28th of 2024 for 33 million 37317 the original 30

million plus acred interest from the date that the funds were received of three that the funds were received of three million37317 so the entire amount from the date of inception to the date that the fund was established was transferred into the endowment fund the next one was the investment of the funds the objective was to verify that

they were vest invested based on the directive of the board of dire of directors and on the observation on the next page was that on august 28th the funds were transferred to local government pool this was back on 28 of 24 to the text pool and the remainder of the account as of august 24 was there before

the transfer the funds were held in the text pool account with the college funds so they were co-mingled but they were tracked separately so even though the funds were not transferable into the fund originally they were tracked separately so yes the investment funds are followed with the board directives was an executive committee established and as required by

the trustees and the answer is yes on february 29 2024 the board of trustees appointed the executive committee of the student success endowment fund keeping on going a scholarship selection committee and on top of the executive committee that the president was directed to appoint a committee that directly reports to the executive committee and again on the next

page the observation that was that during the first executive committee meeting on 2024 the scholarship select committee was established on april 29th 2024 the team developed the eligibility scholarship criteria the scholarship committee then first met with the executive committee on may of 2024 to discuss the eligibility and the scholarship selection committee was present with the executive committees

on the upcoming meetings so the answer is yes that objective was achieved then presentation by the executive committee to the board of directors again to determine that at the first meeting of the board of directors that the and at the annual meetings a report would be presented basically part of what i am doing now the executive committee

first did present to the board of trustees on september 24 of twenty september 24th of on september 24 of twenty september 24th of 2024 u so the presentation was they again object to completed a presentation by the executive committee to the boards to the college president to determine that the executive committee was providing a report to the

president and the board of trustees at least annually and again the observation was that the first presentation by the executive committee to the board of trustees was done on september of 2024 objective achieved then the corpus fund the objective was to verify that the corpus fund was not spent the objective to verify the corpus funds were not

spent during the fiscal year of 2024 the observation was that and this is the corpus the observation is that the 30 million of the corpus initial donation was made on 2021 the board resolution stated that the student success fund should transfer the funds and they were transferred on august of 2024 for the 33 million37 that i mentioned

earlier the fund included interest earned and they were tracked separately in the accounting records since the donation was received the 33 million includes interest earned since the date the donation was made as of august 2024 the text pool account had the full 33 056 so yes the 33 million corpus was retained and the extra three million is

also in there then the next one this is where if i can spend a little bit of time because we will need a i think there'll be a presentation for suggestion from the board an allocation of scholarship and determination of the funds available the objective was to verify that 90 of the interest acred during the fiscal year

ending august 24 from the student success endowment fund was allocated to the scholarships to students of the el paso community students of the el paso community college the issue is that this is saying that 90 of the interest earned from the student success endowment fund well the success endowment fund was created a few couple years after the

initial deposit so if you jump down to the observation the first scholarship awarded from the student success fund is done in the subsequent year october of 2024 so no scholarships were awarded during this fiscal year but if you will jump down the resolution states that 90 of any interest accured every fiscal year from the student success endowment

fund should be allocated to the scholarship of the allocated to the scholarship of the three 184 three 184 that is the interest earned from the date the funds were received and the to the date that the deposit was made of the date that the deposit was made of the three 100 three 100 three 100 one 79 one

79 actually represents interest earned from the date of inception to the date that the fund was actually to the date that the fund was actually created the remaining one 475 represents interest earned prior to the date of the creation of the student success fund so what we are doing is splitting hairs here that the funds were deposited

it earned three million but well not but one four million of that three million was earned prior to the establishment of the fund and because the resolution says earnings from the fund should be allocated to the to the scholarship a question arises what happens to the one million400 that was earned prior to the establishment of fund picking

words here and splitting airs so i think to make everything so that the board or management knows what to do with those one four the question arises should this pre-establishment of fund earnings be put into the corpus of the three million or can it and i believe that is probably what the board wanted or can it go

into the scholarship available interest for scholarship available interest for scholarships and that is going to be question that'll be brought up to you a little bit later so hopefully i explained that well okay and then the very same thing on the allocation of the emergency fund that nine to verify that nine of the interest for the from

the start student scholarship fund is put aside for emergencies no emergency funds were distributed at that time and again we need to know what to do with the one 49 of that and then finally on the last one the allocation of reinvestment to the corpus and that was to verify that one of the interest accured would be

kept and added to the corpus and again the oppos observation is that yes the first presentation of the board was made on september 24 and the funds were deposited then the corporate funds to verify the corporate funds were not spent during the year no the 30 million is intact including the one and then allocation and determination of

funds available finally to verify that 90 of the interest accured during the year ended august 24 from the student endowment fund was allocated to the scholarship to scholarships for this programs and again down at the end u we are stating that the first scholarships awarded were in the subsequent year which is october of 2024 and again the

90 and the nine and the and again the 90 and the nine and the one are in the fund the resolution needs to determine clearly what happens what we should be doing with the funds that were originally earned and finally approval of contracts to verify that the executive committee had prior approval from the board of trustees for

contracts and the observation is that the executive committee did not enter into any contracts as of august 31st into any contracts as of august 31st 2024 so hopefully i did not read through that too fast but i did not want to take too much of your time so bottom line is all the objectives were met the only

question is clarification on the interest earned prior to the establishment of the scholarship fund and that is my story any questions ladies and gentlemen yes sir yeah i have one so we are talking about three one mil in interest allocated one four prior to establishment of the legal authority and one seven now controlled and so i am

trying to get a concept for a couple of questions first of all dr sado or are you the one seven million okay is allocated to scholarships in that particular fiscal year were all of those funds allocated no sir okay so there was okay so that leads a question when they say they shall be allocated what happened what

do we do we where does that if does it go back into the we will maintain it in a scholarship fund for students so we maintained a scholarship fund independent it does not go back to the independent it does not go back to the original does not go back into the corpus does not go back into the

corpus correct so if we now then my suggestion is that if we did not use all that money for the scholarship and we have one four million that we need to melt we need to handle it is a one-time thing and we are going to be and my position is okay that a one return of interest back

to the basic deal is probably insufficient compared to a two to five two to three two to four whatever your particular deal is that this is a one-time shot we have the we have the procedure we have the policy to move it forward from here on after that will allocate the funds of that particular year to scholarships

and we did not do we did not allocate all the funds to the scholarships so there is money left over so if we do the keep one four we are going to have a lot more left over let us so let us tuck the one four back into the original and and just have the scholarship fund benefit

from that one a one-time advantage i think that is a board decision mr xer i certainly understand and respect the proposition a couple of things so we received the resources in 2021 and it began to earn interest thanks to our staff who put it away wisely it began to earn interest the board then contemplated how to utilize

these resources with legal counsel's assistance we were able to come up to resolution of how to utilize the resources in 2024 so the initial amount of interest was much larger than we would have anticipated providing in any given year of scholarships so i am by no means am i opposed it is really a board decision on what

to do with the one 475 that is additional revenue that was collected before that period of time where the board established the student success endowment so i would caution the board not to say that we will use all of the resources because there may be years where we are not able to award enough scholarships or the students

do not meet the requirements that have been established based on the on the scholarships and that we could keep those resources because remember it is a fall and spring as well as the following fall and spring that the board has committed to for those students so you are everything that you said is logical and that would be

a board logical and that would be a board decision respectfully i disagree with that sir i think that should be an administrative decision because as a board member i do not want to have that control that you know that we tie the hands of the people that are actually seeing the need up front of the students so

i would just i think that we already articulated the plan clearly rented by legal several times and discussed it and agreed upon it and that is a piece that needs to be discussed by the administrative team or the executive team and made a decision on that well if i may again the question is because it stated that

the interest earned from the fund the so the fourteen million the question is whether that should be put into the corpus and we should have 31 four million that we never spent or can we can we say that the original 30 million is the corpus and every penny earned since that point goes into the scholarship fund for

scholarships i have a question i think it is a 30 million but do not we then take each one year the scholarship fund increases by year the scholarship fund increases by one correct and so in other words so it is not 30 million this it is 30 one fund of that and all i am saying is that

it is a one-time deal we haven't used it there the policies yeah and so we have a question do we want to say we want to have a bigger petty cash i mean i know that three million two million but have we used for lack of a better term have a petty cashache there okay or if we

put it back in the scholarship fund and that in itself becomes a basis for more interest to be earned in the future right and again since it was all established by the board this is a clarification that we are asking the clarification that we are asking the board and dr sarata hagerty if you want to we could

jump into section one nine seven if the board wants to have that discussion now board wants to have that discussion now i mean as long as my personal opinion is the one the money that was made before we set up the fund is put it back in the fund and give it out in scholarships because i think

what the board's idea was we'd always have 30 board's idea was we'd always have 30 million as our as a corpus is our corpus so that so if we made interest before we got around because we had a big discussion on how we were going to do with this money for several days and we finally decided so

just put that other money that was earned prior to put it in the fund and give it out in scholarship yeah i exactly that is why i think the original intent was 30 million is going to be the corpus anything it earns goes into the scholarship but we need the scholarship but we need the clarification well scholarships

plus the one yes so we the administration has broken down the data for the board and the if we went with the original intent of would go into the scholarship fund which we would allocate as as quickly as we can as long as students meet the requirements etc 132 773 additional dollars would go into the emergency fund

and then an additional emergency fund and then an additional fourteen 753 fourteen 753 would go back into the fund to try and maintain its buying power so to and maintain its buying power so to speak but again this is a board decision i i want to make sure that that the board's direction does not violate what we

have actually established and i'd ask legal actually established and i'd ask legal counsel i have a question out over there if we had one and we earned one seven million okay that was available to be awarded to scholarships and we did not award it what is to say that we are going to be needing above and beyond

that we are going to plan for future catastrophe it seems to me that the bigger the pad we have the insurance and gives us there i realize the idea that we want to do it but we did not give it all out before correct we did not give it out now so why do we think we want

to save it so we can give it out some other time i think that is fair i my only caution is that it not violate what the board actually established i think the question here is do we want to keep it at 30 million or do we want to add that to and make it 31 like you

said that is our only decision my decision is our number one issue was to make sure we always had the 30 million so i said we do what dr sarat is saying is we put the one is we put the one four back into the scholarship fun and if we do not give it out then it rolls

over to the next year as long as we keep the balance at 30 million bucks 30 million plus one or whatever 30 million plus that is out of the ten we said we are taking out so that is my i am going to make a motion that we do that we do what dr sat is suggesting with

those figures item one nine seven discussion and take possible action to consider whether interest earned between may 2021 to august 31 2023 should be added to the corpus or made available for student scholarships my motion is to give it to student my motion is to give it to student scholarships second you have any other discussion other questions

policies and general information related to el paso community college by the board of trustees item college by the board of trustees item one eight one eight one mr fernando flores vice president of fi of finance and administration chief financial officer will provide a presentation on the fiscal year 2025 2026 budget good afternoon chair hagerty vice chair nahara

secretary to the board graham and members of the board and dr sarata this afternoon i will be preparing a presenting a short presentation on the fiscal year 2526 operating budget and it will be short compared to the others promise i would like to start by saying that the presentation this evening is in direct support of item four

eight which you will have later in your agendas the so budget workshops to the board of trustees have been presented on june the 25th and on august the 6th of this year and during the budget workshops held on june the 25th and august the 6th the board of trustees were provided with updates of the budget development process

the current year budget and the state funding from the 89th the state funding from the 89th legislature state appropriations will be based on house bill eight funding model approved during the 88th legislature as a community college finance bill in this legislature performance measures and payment methods were refined the preliminary fisc year 2526 operating budget was also presented

to include revenue projections additional funding needs and different funding strategies to fund the operating budget so we will also cover the 2526 revenue projections in the next few slides and we are going to talk about the 2526 baseline budget which essentially is the expenditure side of the operating budget based upon executive level submissions of budgets in the

march 2025 time frame then we will present the 2526 proposed budget for your approval this proposed budget for your approval this evening so this is a look at the revenue projections for 2526 and this amount at the very bottom of will be the amount presented for the operating budget because we cannot exceed revenue projections so state appropriations

came in on the revenue projections with a positive variance of five six million or twelve 77 higher than the adopted budget for 2425 tuition and fees are estimated at 38 nine million a small decrease of 214 zero at the last presentation on august the 6th i said that we would keep an eye on fall enrollment and adjust

the figures if necessary i would tell you that as of yesterday our enrollment was two higher during the time of the august six presentation we were down i think 24 students were up like 456 i think yesterday so it has slowly been trending in the right direction and there is still late registration occurring this week so property

taxes now are estimated 75 two million and as the title on this slide says based upon certified property valuations that we got from the cad on july the 25th of this year that is the projection for property tax revenue for next year as a property it has a positive variance of two one million around three higher than

the adopted budget three higher than the adopted budget revenue for the prior year so other income is estimated at six two million as a reminder we budget interest income very conservatively because it is not a good revenue source because it is sometimes unpredictable based upon economic conditions and changes that occur quickly in the news and other places

so following next is the self-supporting revenues projected at three million the total for that column as i said a positive variance of seven four million over the prior year adopted budget overall about a four five about a four five increase next we see these revenues the same amount 173 nine million represented as a percentage of the total

revenues and here property tax revenue is still the highest at 43 27 of the total revenues state appropriations coming in second at appropriations coming in second at 28 62 28 62 followed by tuition and fees 22 38 other income three six self-supporting and o overhead recovery smaller amounts making up the total next we have the baseline budgets

which determine the operating expenditure budget now the baseline budget is based upon submissions by the various executive levels which occurred back in march of this year and this is all the baseline budgets that were submitted without considering any extra request or additional funding requests so when we look at the baseline budget instruction is the highest at 33

eleven or 54 seven million followed by institutional support 49 million 49 seven million or 30 of the baseline budget followed by academic support twenty three million or twelve 28 of the budget interestingly when you combine instruction and academic support you get about 45 of the budget in direct support of students so i would make that clarification for

you operation and maintenance of physical plant thirteen two million or eight followed by student services which also goes to helping students twelve seven million or seven 68 transfers seven five million dollar or four six followed by public service three eight million self-supporting programs are budgeted at so this is the baseline budget that is going to support the

recommended operating budget which you will see in the next few slides this next slide combines both the baseline budget and then the additional funding needs so we just saw on the funding needs so we just saw on the previous slide the baseline budget of 165 four million now you see it again here on this slide and all

the functional areas that comprise that amount and then followed by additional funding requests we had critical needs that were presented to the board previously one seven presented to the board previously one seven million and then an item to adjust our salary tables by six the entry tables the entry levels in the tables valued at 672 zero and

then the three salary increase that was approved at the august 6th board approved at the august 6th board meeting followed by additional requests from the executive levels of one nine million and bianium reserve this will go to mitigate any revenue estimates that we may not have estimated properly for example if the state appropriation comes in lower than

what we projected this would be where we might balance that difference if it was lower so all told this is the budget proposed budget for fiscal year 2526 we believe that all the revenue estimates are conservative and cons have considered certain risks that we are subject to like state appropriations having a bianium reserve and we believe that

this is a sustainable budget going that this is a sustainable budget going forward it has been a long process starting in february so i'd like to thank the budget office led by miss lauret tees lilana arlo and bronn cahimenez also associate vice president zuniga which is in the audience and also in my office in particular my staff

for fiscal year 2025 2026 in an amount not to exceed 150 zero annual aggregate any questions on four three i have a question on four three go ahead actually in the whole thing if you look at four two three four and five all fall under the larger category of media if you total them they come to just

a tad short of one million okay so i have a couple questions first of all these are broken up by topics and i think if i remember correctly these requested amounts are similar or comparable to a pre a request at this time last year about the same amount is that correct that is correct okay now if we

had a million dollars how much of that did we spend last year did we spend that all of that money last did we spend that all of that money last year we spend less than 500 zero on advertising but this gives us the flexibility based on research to adjust where we are spending the money okay so you

are asking for 950 zero aggregate in all four would you anticipate that you would need all 950 or if not why no last year we only spent 460 zero and this year the same amount is in the budget and so and the reason for that is so this way we have flexibility when we are looking at our

return on investment and we see the data on how the advertising is producing we can adjust for example if we see we need to spend a little bit more in television or we need to spend a little bit more in radio to reach a particular demographic it gives us the flexibility to make those adjustments okay and last

question in looking at that how do we determine do you have a survey or is it general questions or it is observation what would lead you to make you know like an on real time decision over the year as to where to go where to emphasize your median that is a great question we are always monitoring whether

it is anecdotal or whether through measurement for example on our digital advertising we are able to measure click-through rates that would be one example other times we look at enrollment and determine where the dollars are making an impact and adjust accordingly and dr sat out of all this if i am not mistaken i think this is one

of the few times that we actually have one person really is sort of working with a budget of a million dollars and i think i think she is done that area has done an exceptional job exceptional job in being able to identify segregate qualify and follow up and respond in real time as to what needs to be

done and appears to be do not go to your head but appears to be a good steward of the money mr xer i certainly appreciate that and i certainly concur that dr mo and her team have done a tremendous job we saw spring enrollment up approximately five summer enrollment was up eleven we were we are currently surprised

that fall enrollment is relatively flat we are up a couple percent today and we have we are continuing the enrollment process and we will continue it through many meers but i agree dr mo and her team have done a great job of disagregating the data and utilizing the different modes of communication with students they have shifted over

time we used to do a lot more television and they have shifted over time to do a lot more social media and i agree and concur with your congratulator congratulatory statements towards you any other questions thank you four or i can call the question mr exter boy it look sad if i said no would not mrs robas

of fiscal year 2025 per 100 valuation of fiscal year 2025 2026 any dis questions on four seven four eight four nine four eight four nine yes when we look at four nine we with the budget and so i referred back to page 113 which talks about that and then actually what happened is that it refers then to

a table on four and we have the auxiliary budget for fiscal year and if i look at that there is two columns it says budget 83125 and it has ending fund balance of five 538234 and then it says budget beginning the next year at five 824 so there is a delta of almost 300 zero gain do we

not have if we say end of year budget and a start of year budget those is does there something occur in between there that you are not tracking how come that we have 300 zero difference that that is a very good observation mr oxer that is a budgeted projection for ending fund balance and not the one based

upon actual numbers so it is a budgeted the budget is a projection so this is what we budgeted for the end of this year as the fund balance but in reality it is going to come in higher because revenues came in higher to the auxiliary fund therefore we start with what we believe is going to be the

beginning balance which is higher because we had higher revenues than expected okay so we think we think the bottom line is one thing but then if we sit back and think about it the bottom line of another one's the same thing is different and so we do not want to account and say i have a guess of

is that right i do not i am just it is still not clear i mean if it is sort of an estimate how come you do not have a consistent estimate between years i understand that is fine it is good it just seems to me that if you have end of year and starting year it ought to

be the same number or you ought to qualify your assumptions any other questions on four ten other questions i okay mr exer i okay mr exer hi mrs robas mrs robas hi miss nahara miss nahara hi dr graham dr graham hi mrs moy mrs moy hi mr mendes mr mendes hi mr hagerty i need to read an

established we have gotten that grant every year we are now over one five million and the driving force behind the various incarnation of our true grants is dr sariah hajar who is also in the audience one of our deans at our rio grand campus thank you her and her team do a fabulous job this one is focused

on pharmacy tech and increasing opportunities for students in pharmacy tech very much needed high demand occupation in our region is nursing and so dr hafi guerrero our dean of nursing over there received the u nursing grant to increase the opportunities and capacity for our lvn students our one-year nursing students to transition into our rn program our two-year

nursing program prior to kind of establishing some changes in that program students had to re-rank into the nursing program this now gives them an opportunity and resources to allow them to move directly into the two-year program we will have more nurses in the region because of his work thank you dr because of his work thank you dr

dedto and then finally another shout out to director lucia rodriguez and dr mitchell the d2a texas grant will help our parenting students and give them resources and assistance this is part of our familyfriendly presence we now have family-friendly centers at every one of our campuses and this is going in support of those so thank you lieutenant director

lucia rodriguez you lieutenant director lucia rodriguez cherry i have a question dr smith just if i understand correctly i mean do i recall correctly that our reg regular full nursing rn programs and lvn programs are fully subscribed that is that the attendant we are at max load for each one of those we are at max load for

each one of those classes that is correct and are is there is there a waiting list there is currently i will tell you that dean guerrero is establishing a night lvn program to increase capacity increase capacity okay and so we are working on ways to make more seats available in those make more seats available in those programs

okay would not one of the things that having a bottlenecks if you will is having the trained faculty i mean you can ask extra time but you only have we are sort of maxed out on faculty hours is that you know yeah there is a couple of limiting factors to growing the program resources obviously rooms and labs

at the college we have done great work in advancing opportunities there qualified faculty is a hurdle and available clinical sites are also kind of a hurdle okay i just want to point out would you go and tell us what your the the general pass rate has been for those programs over the last five years or sort of

yeah generally the pass rate for accreditation purposes hovers around 90 that is the bar we have exceeded that in the last number of years so we hover depending on the program between 92 and 95 without being specific you know if i am not correct that is exceeds the pass rate and the qualification rate of any other nursing

program by any other institution here in town would that be correct i i am going to qualify that we are absolutely one of the highest pass rate entities in the region so dr sata you need to give them a pat on the back besides your yeah dr now let us start devote since we have an extra million

for okay let us see if we cannot devote that okay let us see if we cannot devote that to stealing some of the the instructors from some of the other programs and getting our program you know and we are doing better than they are as one of the best why do not we just provide them the opportunity
