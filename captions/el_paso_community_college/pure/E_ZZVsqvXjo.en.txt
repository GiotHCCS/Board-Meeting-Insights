thank you so much dr escamia what a pleasure to be with you all this morning i haven't shook hands because i am just a tiny bit under the weather so it always happens around this time of year the winds etc i think it is allergies but i am slowly getting over it let me thank our media and

it folks for the great work that they have done throughout this is the fourth one have a couple left so i am getting better so you all are in the mi in the middle of this i am getting better at this as i go through it i cannot thank belle enough for the great work that she is

done on the presentation our staff leslie others that are here helping with snacks etc and they even brought a tray a small tray for me because i dropped my coffee yesterday so again let me jump right in and again thank you all for the great work that you do my time is your time so i really appreciate

the very gracious introduction but my time is the staff's time my time as a student's time my time is this community's time and so i certainly appreciate the opportunity to share some of the incredible work that you all are leading i want to start with and jump right in with dr amaya and the great work that he

and his team are doing with regards to student and enrollment services and jumping right into our signature event on ensuring that our community knows about the institution that our high school seniors realize we are not going to give them an excuse we are going to go to them while they are there we are going to close the

deal while they are still in high school and so this is a signature event that we have it started in march at harmony we we are going to recruit everyone you know charter schools etc we are going to recruit them we are going to try to encourage them to enroll in higher ed the data is overwhelming 71

72 of all jobs by 2031 will require some post-secary education or training and so we want to be able to facilitate this going all the way through may the 3rd and that is tahhano day that is going to be at the trans mountain campus this time i am going to touch on that a bit more in addition

dr m and his team continue to work really hard on ensuring that our seniors go forward and utilize apply texas to apply for higher education in the state of texas any public institution can utilize apply texas so it is not us just recruiting for us although that is a primary objective but it is us for recruiting for

higher ed period trying to get them enrolled as you can see we had over eight zero applications by october we were up to nine zero by december then the holidays and students are like everyone else we had about 65 between december 3rd and january 9th but we have now seen it pick up once again to over 9700

applications i'd remind everyone we have about twelve zero seniors in region nineteen so we are doing extremely well and we are going to continue to work on that and continue to move that forward we need to ensure that our isd partners that they take advantage of dual credit and early college high school opportunities and the epcc roundup

held on the 27th of january was a real opportunity for them to take advantage of those areas and to ensure that they have that opportunity to enroll in addition high school counselors are incredibly important they have access to the student body on a regular basis we want to make sure that they are providing that student body with

accurate information and that they know about the institution i shared you know this is my 31st year in higher ed the time goes by really fast many of our counselors are longer in the tooth as i am and so we want to make sure they know and they are aware of all the incredible programming all the incredible

programs that the institution has to offer all the investment that we have made in developing new programs and developing new buildings etc and so we want to make sure this provided we had 40 presenters 88 exhibitors 460 counselors as well as 40 staff and we did not do it alone we did in cooperation with utep as well

but we need to make sure that they are aware of the college and the incredible programs that we have to offer during the pandemic we saw this we saw a real shift in enrollment where the career technical education programs continue to rise during the pandemic while academic transfer programs we saw some enrollment decreases the good news is

we are seeing those come back but we are continuing to see our cte programs demand for those continue to increase so here's a health cte as well as stem event that we held in addition we are doing programspecific addition we are doing programspecific recruitment activities and so we did an activity for nursing and again nursing is a

program that we probably do not have to advertise at all we are still going to do that so the community understands and i will share more about nursing as i go through this presentation but so they understand the great programs that we have again i mentioned to hano day that is going to be on may the three

last year it was on may the 4th or may the 4th be with you we had a star wars theme it was great it was at the mission del paso campus i made sure that i went with my oldest in addition we are going to have it at the trans mountain dr mai and his team rotate these

events so we are going to get to each of the respective campuses as time goes forward but we are certainly excited about this opportunity and again it is an opportunity the students that start the process during collegebound but do not quite finish it that we are able to get them back in and help them finish that prior

to summer as well as the fall term you know we have a lot of services for our students we need to ensure that they know about the resources available to them the texas pathway action plan part of it was to ensure that students knew about a lot of the services from parent resources to the tahano mecado to

epcc cares this these are events that really ensured and trying to advertise these trying to ensure that our students know about them you can see the results still not where we want to be but we are getting much better students were unaware of the food pantry and 23 about 80 of our students were unaware we were able

to drop that down to about 67 we are going to continue to advertise these we are going to continue to ensure that students are aware of these some of the via specific events obviously we had the fall festival that was on the 30th of october we had a qep back to school club fair we had breast cancer

awareness we had a chillax before finals you know we have to make sure that we are moving forward with the lingo of our students sounds like my one of my sons saying that we also we also had welcome week so we have campus specific initiatives again to ensure that our students take advantage of the services utilize everything

that is available to them all in an effort to facilitate their success we will continue to move forward with that let me talk about student government really proud of our student government association and the great work that they do they really do an incredible job of representing their constituents ensuring that those voices are heard ensuring that they

have that opportunity to speak on behalf of students they were in dc october 10th through the 14th for the national conference they were also in austin on february the 3rd we are in the midst of a legislative session i am going to share some of that data at the end of the presentation with you all so that

you are aware very transparent of what is going on in austin there is some really good bills there is some concerning bills from my perspective purely my perspective but we want to make sure that our students are there i had the opportunity to testify i thought i was done i chaired the organization in 2023 but i got

invited to testify in front of house higher education committee this past month and went forward and testified and so commissioner roser was on my left i testified we had ray martinez the president and ceo of the organization next to me and then we had a gentleman from texas 2036 we presented our testimony legislature had no questions and

then they had a student testify and i can tell you that there was six seven questions from the legislators for the students that is how important it is for our students to have their voices heard that is who the legislature wants to hear from it is my responsibility and i will continue to provide information to our legislators

but it shows you how important the student voice is when all the questions went to the student the tano marcado this is an incredible initiative that we are going to continue to work on we are working hard to deal with student hunger it is changed our attitudes towards this has changed i have shared with you i lost

fifteen pounds my first semester in college because i forgot to budget for food and i was not going to call home for additional resources but we have learned a whole lot and sarah goldric among others has taught us that it is very difficult to learn when you are hungry and so we want to ensure that our students

have that opportunity that they are able to utilize the services that we have available to them i will share with you it is become a challenge to maintain to keep it stocked and so i have made a recommendation to the board to utilize our student success endowment fund that is the 30 million that mckenzie scott gifted to

the institution we have invested that money we are utilizing the residue 90 of that goes to scholarships ten or nine of that is for emergencies what i have asked the board is to consider utilizing one of that emergency to help stock the tahano marcado what what is more emergency than needing food and so currently that would be

about 30 zero that would help us stock the medcad significantly so we are going to continue to work hard at this but i cannot thank dr mai and all the team on the great work that they do with that our women's cross country and half marathon want to share information with them they are their first time in

athletic academic history that every single one of our athletes has incredible gpa as you can see and so we want to make sure that we continue to advocate i do not see i do not see our athletic director coach edosa but they continue to do great work in focusing on student athletes being champions on the track and

field as well as in the classroom so certainly excited about that i am thrilled this is the 30th anniversary of our of our baseball program they are 28 and ten they are having a heck of a season i see some of you out there i see one of my baseball colleagues a couple of you all i am

going to see some hats in the audience as well really proud of the great work that they are doing they are 28 and ten now their upcoming games are on the 25th and 26 it is warmer now several of us are out there when it was pretty chilly but it is warmer now it is a great time

to be able to see them and to see them really compete and do great work a lot of enthusiasm cannot thank coach susi and his team for the great work that they do our softball team is just as competitive they are having a great season as well they are currently fifteen and thirteen they have a winning record

paso campus we continue to see great strides and great results from the 8-week semester they are about 85 of their coursework is offered now in 8week terms we continue to see enrollment increase pretty significant enrollment increases as well as success increases and so kudos to them excited about the great work they continue to do that and we

are going to continue to move forward and invest in this particular program dr esamia was very gracious in her induction i cannot thank her enough she led the establishment of our engineering academy in partnership with utep want to congratulate her and all of the committee that worked on this diligently we kicked it off in october of 24

we had eleven of the twelve students that were successful in their first semester in engineering let me remind everyone as a as a former wannabe engineer you have to be calculus ready you know i mean i know that college algebra is the course that we think of with mathematics for students to be college ready and it is

wonderful course and does great work but to be an engineering major you have to be calculus ready which is two steps above college algebra you know so these students are high achievers they work hard we saw 75 of them persisted from the fall term into the spring term excited about the progress we are going to continue to

work hard to increase the size of this cohort it is a dualenrolled program so they are enrolled with the college as well as the university at the same time so kudos to dr esami and the team for leading this the college hosted our 25th annual special interest group in information technology education conference was focused on the intersection

of technology and ethics i know in today's society and i will talk about hacking and things of that nature we need to make sure that we educate our students on the good uses of technology and ensuring that they utilize that i want to thank dr savine and nadia kadichev for leading this effort wonderful event that they continue

to move forward with the hackathon as that i mentioned earlier this was the third one it was hack the border three zero it is a bational hackathon again it was held at this campus was organized by dr cervine and miss karachev in computer science and its over 100 participants from el paso from sidatuarees and from las crues

they focused on this and so again teaching our students how to utilize skills for the right reasons for the good for the right purposes we will continue to move forward with that i want to thank dr smith and vice president flores working collaboratively together to identify resources within the budget to be able to provide equipment needs for

our programs and so fire technology they were able to get a new fire pumper this is incredibly important these are some of our first responders but they were able to do that and be able to continue to have state-of-the-art technology so that when they finish and graduate and they move into the field that they are very aware

of how to use the equipment that is available to them i am going to touch a bit on several of our selective programs so that we are an open admissions institution i am very proud to be open admissions we have high expectations for the success of our students but we do have a number of selective programs primarily

in nursing and allied health and i want to speak to those simply because of the results that we are seeing based on the great work of our faculty and the commitment and dedication of the students in these respective programs the physical therapy assistant students had a 100 pass rate in their certification exams in 24 they had a

mean score that was seven points above the national average want to thank our faculty for ensuring that our students are successful this one's really important to me as someone who is had dental issues in the past our dental hygiene discipline is continuing to do great things in 24 they had a 92 success rate exceeding the national average

standard deviation in ten different subject areas they had a 100 pass rate in the clinical exams they also increase their class size by 50 so to be able to maintain that kind of quality that kind of rigor while at the same time expanding their class size phenomenal work cannot thank our faculty and students enough our medical laboratory

technology success they had a 100 pass rate on the mlt national certification exam this fall semester graduates they had a mean score of 630 which is 131 points higher than the national average so again incredible work that they continue to do and cannot thank they continue to do and cannot thank them enough thank you the mrt mitr

radiology technology program success they also had 100 pass rate and i want to highlight that they have had 100 pass rate 26 of the last 29 years again incredible work that our oops i should hit forward incredible work that our faculty continues to do our echo cardiography program 100 ultrasound physics exam pass rate this is tremendous work

as well all nine of those students now qualify for the adult echo registry exam which is up to 60 days before graduating in the spring of 25 again we want to make sure and want to thank our faculty for the great work that they continue to do when i was at the rio grande campus we had our

surge tech students that were actually in the audience it was good to see them but our surgical technology program they have increased enrollment by 100 starting this spring again we hear from the hospitals on a regular basis dr smith and his team they tell us the kind of demand that they are having we work to accommodate those

demands again while maintaining the rigor and the quality of these respective programs want to thank margaret rodriguez the technology program coordinator for the great work that she does with our students and then our associate degree in nursing program we had the highest firsttime pass rate in the region so all of the public all of the private institutions

in our community we had the highest pass rate again the quality of our program is outstanding we in we had on the national council lens or examination or the enclelex the first time pass rate was 96 for our associate degree earners and it was 97 five for our certificate of completion of vocational nurses we added 125 nurses

to our community i have shared with you all i do not want c nurses working on me i want a nurses working on me i know all of you all want the same and that is the that is the level that we are producing so certainly thrilled with that our vocational as i indicated they had a 97

twelve pass rate and they added 40 additional vocational nurses to our community so we continue to meet the needs of our hospitals in to meet the needs of our hospitals in our community again mr flootus and dr smith identified resources within the budget to be able to provide additional echo cardiography equipment upgrades you see that we were

able to add a vascular ultrasound transducers as well as highfidelity cardiac ultrasound simulators i know it sounds easy to pronounce those but i have practiced a lot but this is important that these students have access to the cutting edge technology so that when they go into the field they know how to use the equipment appropriately the interprofessional

simulation education center at epcc's rio grand campus is in the process of provisional accreditation i want to thank mr tomas sto as well as sarah alfala and currently working on with the health and nursing faculty we expect provisional accreditation it took place in march and we are moving forward with those first two years the interprofessional simulation center

or the ipc at epcc again rio grand campus a partnership with episd we need to ensure that our districts understand again all of the incredible programs that we have at the college and part of that is exposing them to the kind of equipment and the kind of programs that we have at the institution so that they are

fully aware as they are making their choices for higher education dr smith and his team have done a tremendous job of taking care of taking advantage of true grants this is texans reskilling and upskilling through education we started this program back in 21 and we have received three grants totaling just short of 700 zero we want to

make sure that we take advantage of every resource that the state has available and so kudos to dr smith and his team for taking advantage of those true grants i want to thank and congratulate dr jafari once again she was nominated and appointed to serve on the student success advisory work group with the coordinating board there she

is with commissioner roser and we look forward to her contributions to this important committee want to thank and congratulate dr sarah martinez she received the buddy davidson grant award again it is for the estab establishment of apiaries and molecular research on campus that will benefit our students as well as our students in the sciences as well as

our 64 zero this one's very exciting for me our culinary arts and related sciences travel and tourism hospitality operations are moving forward with wine making and brewing implementation not sorry not as big of a wine drinker but i do enjoy the brewing and this is something that we have been working on for a long period of time

want to thank dr nickerson and his team for the great work that they have done in establishing these i look forward after five of course to sampling what they have come up with look forward to it cannot thank our epcc fashion technology program they have done a great job helping students achieve great success understand what they will

be up against when they go into the field these are cutthroat fields and so we have had a lot of alumni who have achieved great things that alumni is willing to come back and provide opportunities and insight into the field to our current students we have had folks that have gone on to los angeles apparel to disney

plus etc so we want to make sure that our students have access to those individuals as well you heard me talk about nursing you have heard me talk about all of those allied health fields as well as our fire tech program law enforcement so you think about the first responders in our community we produce so many of

those first responders in our community and so certainly thrilled with the law enforcement training academy they will be celebrating their 100th graduating class in july of this year want to special shout out to mr bogle he is celebrating 40 years with the institution he did twenty years as a part-time instructor from 85 to 2005 and he is

been the director for the last twenty years and so kudos to them also want to thank dr smith and mr flores for identifying resources again to look at renovation for these particular areas to ensure that they are up to speed and equipment everything in there is at the best that we can possibly have it miss marufo and

her team continued a great job with the small business development corporation they had just short of 700 clients that they counseledled just short of four zero counseling hours and they saw a capital infusion into our local economy of over thirteen five million again these are community available services that we provide another one is mr admandadis and his

team at the contract opportunities opportunity center we had 163 businesses that were counseledled over 800 counseling hours almost one 250 jobs that were retained or created and you see the award total 354 awards just short of 59 million of infusion into our local economy tremendous work dr smith and his team are going to continue to develop new

programs as we see the demand for those respective programs we are looking at demand both in the field as well as student demand and we are looking at encouraging new program development for programs that are going to pay our students at least a living wage and so we developed an aas in music business an aas in audio

engineering and a level two certificate in music technology program and so excited about this we are currently have 113 students that are enrolled in these respective programs and we will continue to develop those and move those forward initiatives this is incredibly important i do not see a lot of students in the audience but for students we want

to ensure that you are incredibly involved with your civic responsibility from my perspective to vote and so we have a tahana pool worker grant it is a two-year 49 zero grant awarded by the us election assistance commission and it helps us it is we are one of fourteen national recipients of the help america vote college program poll

worker grants so we want to make sure that we provide the information to our students so that they are educated voters and that they go out and again from my perspective utilize and move forward with their utilize and move forward with their civic responsibility i want to thank dr mitchell and mr dwire for their great work on

ensuring that we were able to reopen our veterans resource centers we had grand reopenings for these on the 30th we did one at trans mountain and one here at the vive campus our men and women in uniform serve us so well we have had a long history with fort bliss in the military we want to ensure that

our soldiers feel comfortable as they exit the military coming into our institution and help them be successful ssp the student support services program it is one of the trio programs we are excited about the progress that they have made we received this in december you see the overall graduation rate the transfer rates and the persistence rates these

are these are tremendous programs that work there is a lot of chatter at the federal level i am sure each of you is keeping up with what is happening at the federal level i am hopeful that these grants will survive but again i cannot thank our team for the great work that they do miss rodriguez and her

team we held the epcc first annual familyfriendly conference again we are celebrating student parents dedication to reach their goals and we want to make sure that they feel comfortable on our campuses it was a student parent two-day conference held at northwest as well at mission in february we had almost 300 attendees and more than twenty agencies that

were available it is part of our aspen ascend initiative the aspen institute provided a 75 zero grant so that we can move forward and continue to ensure that we are serving our students that are parents as well as we possibly can again our colleagues are collaborating to increase that student persistence we have a partnership with united way

that was initiated in february again to connect students faculty and staff with community services that are available to them we have resiliency navigators that are available on each of the campuses one day a week want to make sure that everyone takes advantage of this as well miss luhan and her team continue to do a tremendous job with

the first year experience this has been a long evolution of this particular program we started it in 2009 with a vision of how we could make this a go in 2016 we received an hsi hispanic serving institution title five grant and we were able to establish an early alert program and this particular grant is the best illustration

of how we are supposed to utilize grants are seed money they allow you to move forward with an idea that we think will work to help our community to help our student body etc and if it does work well the expectation is that you institutionalize as much as you can within the budget dr smith and his team

have done a tremendous job of institutionalizing the firstear experience program you see that we opened the northwest firstear center in october of last year and then you see the first one that we opened here at the viveet campus in february of 2019 again tremendous job of moving that forward dr castillo tar and her team did a great

job of epcc's cares grand opening we want to make sure that we continue to move this forward it was well represented by several of our community partners we had that in february of this year so again want to make sure that every our student body is aware of these great services that we have available to them oops

let me go back again dr smith and his team do a tra a tremendous job of capitalizing on house bill eight so house bill eight allowed us not only to be funded based on outcomes things of that nature but it also allowed us to be funded for nonredit and short-term credentials that in the past we'd never been

funded for we are only going to offer the credentials again that are in demand in our community and that are going to pay our students at least a living wage i know i have colleagues that may be offering different kinds of programs that is just not in my core and what we believe in we are going to

offer programs that ensure a living wage for our students and that are in demand so we have developed significant number of occupational skills awards we have new certificate programs we have done revised fields of studies you see the program name changes as well so again this is an us in an effort to serve our community but also

an effort to ensure that we are taking in full advantage of house bill eight and what the our stem fueta program again another hsi grant that we received this is a one 75 million grant they continue to move forward with their pathway program we had 250 students from biology architecture and engineering courses that have participated i want

to thank dr jameson the project director as well as our co-pis norah cavalier and clark meyers for making this program a success certainly excited about that our architecture art math and science division we held our second steam open house i really appreciate the a in the arts in the steam it was held in february of this year

we had over a 100 students that attended with their families i want to thank mr dalamantes as well as the aams faculty and staff for ensuring that this program was a success let me take a pause to say we are in the cafeteria i remember coming to the cafeteria in my first year and providing state of the

you state of the college as well as town halls we do not use this as often as we used to because we have the flexatorum in the a building now because we have added facilities the good news is it was booked which is good that means we are offering more and more and this is still an adequate

facility for us to come together and be able to provide an update of where we are mr paul hatchkin tremendous job we do live in the desert we want to make sure that we understand how valuable water is preparing researchers extensionists and educators for water sustainability our preh2 program we had 31 students that have participated in internships

with fourteen local organizations again incredibly valuable for our community and for us to develop that understanding of how important a resource is and that we utilize make sure that we treat it with respect industries that have visited the vi verde students to discuss internship opportunities the national renewable energy labs came in november dr celiano mr mrs ria

shon mr mendula and daniel bernal spoke to students about research projects we also had the us department of agriculture and m's agra life extension come in on december again to provide insights and hopefully encourage students to take hopefully encourage students to take these opportunities stem continues to be incredibly important incredibly important fields but i'd also share that

liberal arts and the humanities have also increased in the importance based on the development and expansion of artificial intelligence but we understand that we need to ensure that children have access and they are exposed to stem programs at an early age to develop that that passion for the stem field for them and so i want to thank

and congratulate the college on moving this forward on february 18th we held this at the flexiatorum it was open to the public again it was an opportunity to enhance the stem awareness in our children early in their lives jose jesusita pardon me ivara as well as norah cavalier led this and certainly excited about that the mexican-american cultural

center want to we have moved forward with this i want to congratulate ingred leva as well as miguel valenuela for the great art that is being displayed in that for them certainly excited about that again the talent that we have at the institution is amazing and thrilled that we are sharing that talent with the we are sharing

institution and have chosen to move forward in retirement we want to make sure that they stay connected to the college i give dr graham full credit for nudging us to move forward with this and so we had in october a retire network social at the mission del paso campus we had a retire we are going to have

to ensure that we are in full compliance for those of you who do not remember senate bill seventeen is affectionately known as the anti-dei law in texas we have to ensure that we are in full compliance with it and so they came in they reviewed a tremendous amount of information they found some areas on websites that we

needed to correct we have corrected those items but we did this in preparation because the state auditor's office will come in and do an audit of the institution for the same area so we wanted to make sure that we were up to speed on that again mr flores and ap zuniga did a tremendous job daniel rodriguez alvarado

assisted and so we are certainly excited about that the 32nd annual staff development retreat where as i mentioned earlier we are in a legislative session so i was glad to wish them well as they went to austin and i was able to stay home that was march 20th through the 22nd excuse me their theme was kicking your

boot into gear and so i asked them to make sure and they went and visited the capital to make sure and pop in on our delegation thank our delegation for the great work that they do on our behalf but really important for them to get to austin during a legislative session so glad they were able to do

that i know miss melenna field joined them and so excited about that dr linda brown continues to lead and do a tremendous job and the committee of leading the leadership academy their theme for this year is time our most valuable resource it time goes by really fast and so they they have several different guest lecturers that are

coming in to help with that topic including mayor johnson as well as the ceo for the yw ca and so important that we do provide our faculty and staff with opportunities to have this to be leaders in the future we held our 16th annual literary fiesta you know reading is fundamental we want to make sure that our

community is aware of that we had as you see yasmin ramides as well as mr blevens always good to bring back again mr bleven a retiree he was able to be a part of this as well and books are gems so excited about that also excited that the literary fiesta was featured in the city magazine in the

october issue of this past year and dr miss yasmin ramirez was featured for her silver medal at the international latino book awards for her memoir andale preta and so again the talent that we have at the institution is amazing want to make sure that we continue to get it out there so that people can see it sarella

aguilad does a tremendous job with our sun city portfolio day that was held in january of this year it was the sixth year in a row we had over 400 students that registered to attend and we had nineteen colleges and universities that parttook in this again for our students to have access to college faculty to be able

to guide them as they continue to hone in on their skills as artists let me touch a bit on mr fernandez and his team and what it is continuing to move forward at the institution they are moving forward with their windows operating system upgrade this the tech support team has completed about half of the windows operating upgrade

they expect to complete that work by the end of the year again important work that we need to ensure the security of our systems our data dedicated service servers rather they are moving forward with that as well they have successfully deployed dedicated service for the calibro system and the organization's database system again ensuring the protection that we

have the most upto-date equipment and that we are protecting that equipment in addition i want to thank mr fernandez and his team for providing more and more services online and virtually the id card portal will allow students and employees to access their id cards online each of you know so many of these different initiatives are now available

online we want to make sure that we are continuing to keep up with that kudos to mr fernandez and his team for moving that forward our enterprise computing i was talking to a couple of folks that were just at the national conference for the enterprise computing or the administrative banner eight they have done a lot of work

on on custom forms on moving these forward they converted 41 custom banner aid forms to modern userfriendly web-based applications these range from specialized admissions to the prep program as well as online employee contracts again tremendous effort to make sure that we continue to move this forward and then finally they have also worked diligently on our enterprise computing

or powerbi i have powerbi on my on my ipad it is one of the first things i look at daily is just to see where we are what the data looks like at the institution they were able to pull the pathways and technology early college high school students or the pek students out so that we are able

to track them separately from the early college high school students and so we now have that ability to do that this is the fastest growing segment at the institution and we can keep up with their success rates via powerbi they have also continue to work on our in-house productions from epcc tv everything from the arts at epcc

all the way to bis talks you see mature living creative thinkers etc so kudos to them for continuing and ensuring that these programs continue to move forward dr penley and her team doing great work in research accreditation and planning we this year is the end of our current strategic plan we are getting ready to launch our new

strategic plan that will go from the fall of 2025 into through go from the fall of 2025 into through 2029 we have a new vision statement as well as a new mission statement you get a an early look at those and actually you helped develop those so thank you all for doing that they are excellent vision and

mission statements they are also compliant with sb17 as you can see but it is important for us to continue to move this work forward so i cannot thank dr penny and her team for the great work that they do my watch is telling me that i need to stand and i am standing so let me put my

arm down so i get credit for standing in addition dr penny and her team continue to lead the pathways project we have four pillars we have entry progress completion and career whether that is going straight into the workforce or to transfer to university to continue your studies we have co-leads for each of these areas we have one

who is an owner or works in that particular area and then we have one from outside of that area what we are trying to do is ensure that all of the college is aware of each of these different areas and is willing to participate and so i want to thank them for that great work so for instance

on entry they are looking at customer service survey that was launched in april it is launched this month they are examining service experiences of all students with a focus on online and non-traditional students all of these are an effort to get better you see what progress is focused on as focused on as well you also see what

completion is focused on the student drop data and qualitative responses again we are focused on the communication needs of non-traditional students want to make sure that we are serving all of our students extremely well miss bell and her team continue to move forward with learning assessment outcomes assessment and we are looking at a wellness check for general

education that will be completed this spring and then entry student success initiatives that are being reviewed in the spring and so again cannot thank them enough for the great work that they do want to touch a little bit on enrollment so this is fall data we saw i will remind everyone it seems so long ago but in

the fall of twenty we had a significant hit to enrollment due to the pandemic in the fall of 21 we saw another hit to enrollment not quite as large but in the fall of 22 we started to see it reverse and we have seen and we have worked really hard all of us led by dr mia and

his team of ensuring that enrollment continues to come back so we saw about a one gain in the fall of 22 a two gain in the fall of 23 about a half gain in the fall of 24 and let me share that this spring we saw a five increase in enrollment this spring so that is a that

to me is a really good sign i am hopeful that will carry into summer and fall but we are seeing not only career technical programs we saw a significant increase in our academic transfer programs as well so it is good to see that i get a little nervous because community college enrollment traditionally has a direct relationship with

the economy and so if enrollment's starting to build back i worry that the economy might be a little weak but i will take the enrollment so certainly excited about that and we are also seeing our success rates get back to prepandemic levels so persistence from fall to spring went from 77 to 78 to 81 so great work

by our faculty our staff everyone at the institution who continues to focus on this incredibly important it is a this incredibly important it is a legislative session so i want to provide some state and legislative updates to you all the first is dr win roser dr win roser is the new commissioner of higher education got appointed in

late december started officially in january i do not i i am sure i shared with you i was asked to serve on the advisory committee so jay hartzell the former president of ut austin myself and james hallmark the vice chancellor of academic affairs for the m system we served with the chair of the coordinating board the vice

chair and the secretary we recruited we did our best to recruit individuals to serve as commissioner or to consider serving as commissioner i did reach out to dr roser we have a long history he knows our institution well he is a deep thinker and has was a longtime university administrator he knows the college very well and he

knows community colleges very well he was one of our commencement speakers back in i think 2014 let me also provide dr roser a lot of kudos this is a real calling for him he took a 40 pay cut to serve as commissioner of higher education it is our it is my expectation that my colleagues and i as

well as everyone we help him be successful and we are going to continue to move forward but he has hit the ground running in a legislative session and so he is doing a great job i am certainly excited about that i'd remind you the themes that came out of house bill eight from the 2023 session were funding

for outcomes affordability for students and investments in capacity the key components of house bill eight were fast our financial aid for swift transfer shared services performance tier which is 100 of our funding so 95 of the state's funding is performance tier but for epcc it is 100 of our funding base tier is five for the 22 colleges

that are small that do not have significant tax bases so that gets distributed to them and then finally the community college standing advisory committee i am the inaugural chair i will serve in that capacity until next year and then they will move forward with another chair our focus areas for this session were the first the supplemental appropriations

request so we have a dynamic system so we get funded on projections here's how you we think you are going to do based on what you have done and then we have a settle process on actuals here's how well you did do you does the state owe you money do you owe the state money back so the

first thing was supplemental appropriations piece so the colleges the 50 colleges we thought we were going to need an additional 38 to 40 million then our expectation got to about 48 million when all of the outcomes for the 50 colleges came forward were certified by the state the state owed us 89 five million and by us the

50 colleges not us individually i wish but we performed well we performed well and i asked vice president flores to let me know when that money was wired to the college but we got about a four million wire to the college based on the actual outcomes that you all produced so that was the first thing we needed

that supplemental appropriations requests approved second thing is full funding for the next bianium so the coordinating board based on our outcomes has projected that we will see the sector about a five increase in outcomes which means an additional 140 million to the two billion that is distributed to the 50 community colleges so that is moving forward there

is two companion bills that i will touch on shortly that are moving that forward and then again you have heard me say this repeatedly we needed to make sure that the that private institutions were part of this in texas that transfers to private institutions baylor for mlennon community college etc so that is moving forward we are continuing

to work on to scale workforce partnerships that is incredibly important again we are doing a great job of that that is why our career technical education programs continue to increase but we are also looking at skills development fund increases as well as jet our jobs and education for texans increases as well as true texas reskilling and upskilling

through education state agency workforce credentials we are continuing to look at those and ensuring that we are requiring the right credential to work in these and we have a partnership with the state on that and then we need to make sure that we have access to clinical rotations there was a lot of private schools that were coming

in and we were they were offering to pay the hospitals for the clinical rotation sites so there is legislation to mitigate that so that the public institutions colleges and universities has have access to those as well i am only going to talk about three bills two are really good bills house bill 2110 and senate bill 1786 these

are companion bills these are the house bill eight cleanup bills so they do good things and they do some things that we i am got to be very transparent about so they clean up some of those the private school transfers all of those kinds of things but they also when we started this in the 23 session we

were looking at a 10-year window and all of our credentials had a return on investment in those ten years well we are revising and we are continuing to work on this formula and so now that is going to be five years for the associates degrees do students see a return on investment within five years and they there

is a complicated formula looks at aid that students receive but also looks at what high school diploma earners earn statewide average and the investment or the program has to show that it is a hold my if it is for me i am not available but we have to we have to show that the these degree earners earn

at least 30 zero which is the statewide average so i am going to share with you we are going to see a number of associate degrees that are going to fall from funding so about sixteen sip codes and they do not quite make it within that 5-year time frame we are not going to stop offering those we

are going to work harder on a couple of things we will still receive credit if the student transfers so we want to make sure that they transfer and we are going to try to work as a sector to improve and finish get those students to finish faster and so that is what we are going to work on

with those areas and it is a fluid system so if next year all of a sudden we see that those areas are going less than five years they will come back to the funding mechanism now i have also shared with dr smith and his team that short-term credentials by 2027 session we are going to have a time

frame that we will look at those short-term credentials to see if those are paying off for those students whether they are level one certificates or osas and iclc's so those are the that is the good bill a bill of concern for me is senate bill 37 it is it has significant concern for me it actually has significant

concern for the board as well what senate bill 37 aims it what its goal is it aims to shift power from faculty to governing boards i can assure you dr bham that judge hagerty and his colleagues they do not want that colleagues they do not want that responsibility this from my perspective is very much going from local

control to controlling going from local control to controlling the locals i have real concerns it shifts a lot of responsibilities from our faculty senate to the governing board and to me i do not want that responsibility i do not want to say dr burnham you are the chair of faculty senate that is what the bill says that

i would have to pick the officers that is that to me is not my responsibility that to me is the faculty's responsibility i can assure you regardless of the outcome of senate bill 37 that dr smith and i have a firm belief in shared governance the board understands that belief in shared governance and the college will continue

to move forward in that fashion we will comply with whatever laws passed but we are hopeful that this gets mitigated a little bit about the community college sector we are once again the largest sector of higher education in the state of texas so we have recovered a lot we are not quite to where we were in nineteen

but we have recovered a lot amongst the 50 community colleges we are well over 700 zero students we awarded the latest data available well over 125 zero degrees and certificates and we provide 96 of all of the state's cte credentials so the texas state technical colleges and the lamars they provide the state four of those credentials so

we need to make sure that our legislature understands us and that the role that we play in the state so we have made sure that they understand that now it would not be appropriate if i did not at least acknowledge some if i did not at least acknowledge some recognitions so first the vi campus specific you see

award winners we have to get a picture of oscar alcantar but he was the february 25 employee of the month we had jamie wilson in november edmundo mononttoya in december and robert mahia in march and so certainly thrilled with that you heard me say this earlier i cannot thank dr escamia for the great work that she did
