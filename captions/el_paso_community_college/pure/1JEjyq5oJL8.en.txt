texas senate bill 37 it should read 89th legislative regular session including statutory sections governing the establishment and function of faculty councils or senates texas education code 51 3522 texas education code 51 3522 51 3523 51 3523 51 3523 51 3541 51 3541 51 3541 51 913 51 913 and 51 9431 pursuant to section 554 071 of the

texas government code have a motion move to approve move to approve second i have a question okay that is after i say discussion okay ask okay ask discussion well i want to ask the attorney first do we need to go to an executive do we need to go to an executive session we do not judge unless somebody

has a legal question about this okay well this is mr oxer you may have a legal question but is it not a legal question john i do not hope not okay me too one more time can we go through and have you read these things items as printed a b c or numbers but the list of proposals

as printed in the agenda and not read every one of the letters and numbers please legal council will provide us guidance on that i do not have an issue i hope so because the legal counsel told me in the board meeting last time when i asked to do that it said no problem yeah there there is no

issue with doing that we will do that we will do that okay go ahead doc on 37 so obviously the senate passed senate bill 37 which passed senate bill 37 which essentially abolishes the faculty senate as it is known today as of september 1st we have been working closely with our faculty senate dr smith and i dr

penley has been instrumental in helping us with this as well as well as legal counsel this institution has long recognized shared governance we believe in shared governance so we have to move forward with the resolution in order to be in compliance with the state and we are also moving forward with all of the areas that we have

to implement by the 1st of september this includes the board i will have to appoint members of faculty senate including all the officers not something that i was eager to do but it is what the law is and so i will comply with the law and we will ensure that we are in full compliance again legal counsel

has provided excellence guidance for us as we continue to move forward and i ask miss min as well as as well as her colleague to provide any insight that they have with regards to the resolution i have a question out of this in the re the reappoint is the structure the organizational structure the line the chart organizational

chart for the senate will it remain the same are you designating new physicians realigning responsibilities whatever your responsibility with this are you going to say the send is now organized and composed as previously we would have loved to have done it that way we are not allowed to do it that way so miss maren myself other members

of the institution went to austin this past friday to hear from tasby association of school boards who provides our legal policies and get insight from them they made it very clear that the reading is that i am responsible of appointing approximately a third of the faculty senate it can be comprised of up to 60 members of which

each of the respective divisions will appoint a member or elect a member rather and then i appoint so the constitution of the composition of faculty senate will change the officers i am responsible for appointing they can serve up to six one-year terms and then they have to sit out for a two-year period those senators that are elected

can be elected for one two-year term and then they have to sit out for two years after that term and we obviously are working with faculty senate so that they can have their elections and have one they are looking at one-year terms and two-year terms so they are not all rolling over at the same time as far

as the organization of the faculty senate that will it can be no more than 60 members we anticipate that ours will be approximately 42 members if i am not mistaken dr smith and again we are moving forward in that direction is that a significant change from what we had i mean what exists today is the i mean

what exists today is the old what exists today is the faculty center as it was elected september one yeah as september 2nd is there a significant change in the organization the leadership of the senate no okay that is all currently there is no okay that is all currently there is none okay any other questions mine do you

have any anything to add mine do you have any anything to add please just that we need to adopt this the law requires that the college if it is going to recognize a faculty senate that it be done by september 1st there is tasby is working on a permanent policy with regard to that you will have and

receive at some point in the probably late fall early winter the policy that we have attached is an interim policy it follows this the very closely the language of the statute and the requirements of what the college has to do with regard to the faculty senate but it is a temporary policy for all intents and purposes because

the pol the college uses tasby for all of its policies it is just not ready so we have drafted together with administration the board policy two one two actually administration drafted it and we reviewed this policy and that is what we are proposing it is important that you have also a resolution that i have given you today

then that become part of the board's record along with the policy so that it is clear in the pol in the minutes of the board that this resolution has been adopted and that the board has recognized the continuation of the faculty senate do we need to read the resolution i think it is best judge to have a

clear record in the minutes okay got it bill do we need to vote or you have a first and a second you will read it first and then and then the board will vote to adopt or not the board will vote to adopt or not adopt resolution authorizing the continuation and ratification of the faculty senate whereas during

the 89th texas legislative session in 2025 the texas legislature passed senate bill 37 which was subsequently signed into law by governor greg abbott on june twenty 2025 whereas senate bill 37 relates to the governance of public institutions of higher education including review of curriculum and certain degree and certif certificate programs a faculty council or senate training for

members of the governing board and the establishment powers and duties of the texas higher education coordinating board office of the budsman whereas senate bill 37 in section 51 3522 of the texas education code authorizes the governing board of an institution of higher education to establish a faculty senate and sets forth the policy by which the governing board

shall exist and select its members whereas the board of trustees of el paso county community college district epcc hereby recognizes the importance of the role of its faculty senate and declares that it shall continue to operate at epcc in accordance with section 51 3522 of the texas government code whereas the board of education i am sorry texas

education code sorry whereas the board of trustees of el paso county community college district determines that interim board policy two one two is in accordance with section two one two is in accordance with section 51 3522 51 3522 of the texas education code therefore be it resolved the board of trustees of el paso county community college district

officially ratifies the continuation of its faculty senate adopts interim policy two one two governing the existence and membership of its faculty senate to be in effect until such time as the board of trustees subsequently adopts a policy to be prepare to be prepared by the texas association of school boards in accordance with section 51 3522 of the

texas education code and declares that its faculty senate as designated in intram policy two one two meets the policies adopted by the board and the requirements of section 51 3522 of the texas education code be it further resolved that this resolution along with intram policy two one two be included in the permanent minutes of this board adopted

this 6th day of august 2025 by the board of trustees of el paso county community college district anybody have any other questions if i understand this three if i understand this three 513522 acknowledges that it is discretionary at each institution whether do not have it back or send a senate or not but if they do they set

out the organ organizational structure which you identify is that correct because there is some i guess you there is some institutions some colleges or that do not have as correct that is correct it spells out very clearly that the faculty senate is purely an advisory board that they have no authority in any of the actions of the

institution it is very specific but again from my perspective and from the administration's perspective we believe in shared governance and we believe that it is important for the institution to continue but it is discretionary as whether we have one or not that is correct not that is correct okay but by voting on this five four before this

includes is already in the record so that we can take a vote any other questions call a question though call a question though mr hi mrs robless mrs robless hi mrs moy mrs moy hi mr mendes mr mendes hi mr hagerty mr hagerty hi okay we will need a signature by you and dr graham so that and

so that is included with the signatures in the minutes i know dr not here but i advised that we can get her permission and then insert her permission and then insert her signature sorry auto well we are going back to item five one yes ma'am item five one dr julie penley vice president of research accreditation and planning

will make a presentation on the update of the college district's good afternoon this presentation is a quick overview of where we have been and where you have been as a board where we are as of today and where we are moving forward with our next strategic plan before i get started a huge shout out to rachel vontes

in dr smith's office for drafting the visuals there is no way i could have done this myself so this is the crux of the presentation and if you are crunched for time we can stop here and you can move on but you might remember last summer i came to you during your summer retreat and i presented at

that time the current mission and vision statement and i asked you to put your thinking caps on and make some decisions whether those statements were still accurate in the next five years or whether you might want to revise them after that cabinet began talking about the structure of our work in the near future taking a page out

of dr saja's book with the four pillars of student success that we talked about at the retreat with entry progress completion and career so while you were doing your homework with the mission and vision we were doing our homework beginning to craft some general statements and general goals and outcomes that hopefully would align with that mission and

vision so we were we were working together during during that part of 2024 earlier this year the board came together and finalized and ultimately approved the new mission and mission statement and at that time cabinet once we had the green light had the green light sorry i did not know if i needed to use my teacher voice

once we had the green light in terms of mission and vision then we were able to begin finalizing the goals and outcomes that together with your statements created the skeleton of our strategic plan that plan is in its very final stages with dr mo and director christy frescus on the visuals that will be presented and provided to

the college employees and to you as well as to our external stakeholders the plan itself goes into effect and is officially launched on september 1st at that time budget heads at the college will be creating their new annual area plan for 2526 in alignment and in support of the strategic plan we talked about that at our cabinet

retreat earlier last at our cabinet retreat earlier last month and then we repeat the process in a few years so you will hopefully not have to hear from me about strategic plan so mr xer will there be annual updates i mean i do not see put plan out in 25 and then nobody's going to talk about it

in 26 27 28 we will wait till 29 and do it all over again no we will absolutely be providing updates in cabinet it'll be an ongoing discussion and you say the word and myself or someone from my division will be happy to provide updates think just annually somewhere no absolutely mr plus many of the data presentations

that we bring to the board are part of the strategic plan we will just make sure to reference that as per our strategic plan so that each of the respective board members is up to speed on where we are and then we will have dr penney provide an update have dr penney provide an update annually so going

back to brass tax the vision statement that you all approved in february of this year is on the screen again this is the the screen again this is the aspirational what you are directing the college to achieve not that different in spirit from the previous vision statement we continue to focus on a student success and our role

as an educational institution towards that success through our learning opportunities whether they are structured academic programs whether they are out of the classroom learning to help students achieve their personal goals with the general what comes the general how you all will be achieving that aspirational statement it is a lot of words it will fit nicely in a

booklet and on a poster been doing some terrific work with the visuals with her marketing team but the crux of this statement is again providing not only the educational opportunities but the supports the experiences that holistic college experience to help not only the individual student but their families the community and the region that we and this is

not a statement that you all have approved your focus is on the mission and vision as it should be but we took that vision if you will that philosophy of epcc a step further by generating a student success statement we used to have an equity statement for reasons that we will not discuss we are not touting it

as an equity statement the spirit of this is very similar though we see students as individuals and the heart of this statement is in the last sentence we are committed to success for every student and for creating opportunities for that student and providing resources and support for that student so again your role as a board is to

give us direction through the mission and vision you did that beautifully we added the student success statement to double down on our commitment to supporting every student meeting them where they are and now we are ready to go back to the goals and outcomes again this is something that cabinet worked on there was a lot of back

and forth a lot of intentional conversations how we would support those four pillars that dr sarata has mentioned in multiple presentations and how we can get a little bit more specific in what it means to meet a goal of progress or a goal of completion so this is what we will be rolling out with our strategic plan

what you may notice particularly for returning trustees is we now have some quantifiable metrics associated with these outcomes to better provide budget heads and everyone at the college with some clear tracking if you will of how we are doing towards achieving these goals many of these goals align with what the support what the state has identified as

valuable in terms of funding formulas it also aligns with some of our existing work with our quality enhancement plan so although the words maybe some of the metrics may appear new to employees or perhaps to you they are really a continuation and an explication of the work we have been doing for years some of you have probably

noticed there is an asterisk at the very bottom that one does not have a metric associated with it i will come back to that because you will see that outcome on each of our goals so any on each of our goals so any questions or comments about the outcomes okay moving on to progress as students not only

have come to the college and identified their area of concentration how we can get them to successfully complete that first half of their program so we identified some key metrics that we have found to be important in that student success during those critical first semesters a lot of this is supported by national research you may have heard

dr set out to talk about gateway courses in english and math tend to be bottlenecks for students so we brought that to the forefront of some of our focus dual credit is also a growing population and is something that is you heard from dean bedo last week about the growth in dual credit so we want to bring

that to the forefront as well and again you will see that catchall final outcome of so once we have students and supported students successfully through their first half of the program our work is obviously not done and so our completion goal focuses on getting students to complete their award and so these types of outcomes focus on that

second half of a student's program obviously the total awards not just an award for an award's sake but an award in a meaningful high demand high wage program in our area we obviously do not want students to rack up a lot of credits or a lot of hours that are not going to meet their needs and so

we brought that in as a fourth outcome and then that last outcome which is beginning to look familiar to you i am sure supporting other departments in their goal efforts and then our last goal is that continuation in their educational journey or for students that are focused more on direct work credentials supporting them in that arena as

well so this is sort of a split goal for us continuing to work with our regional partners through our advisory committees and other outlets to make sure that we are meeting the community's demand for highquality program training lensure rates for many of our programs is an important part of getting students into the workforce getting students into the

workforce transfer so far so good all right so that fifth goal it is designed to help divisions such as mine perhaps such as information technology finance and administrative operations we do not have many opportunities to directly interact with students our role is more of a support function and so in order for us to see ourselves in our

strategic plan and to make important and meaningful area plans we added this this outcome as a way to provide that support whether it is by partnering with the education workforce division or partnering with student enrollment services or partnering with one another to create ways to fulfill the strategic plan goals and outcomes for example my the institutional research

department which is in my division the director came to me yesterday and said what do you think about creating some better dashboards to track each one of these outcomes and i said that would be terrific and maybe you could work with it to help that department we can come together and create a really powerful dashboard whether it

is enhancing ing our current structure or creating something new so that everybody can easily track this work and not get lost in the wilderness if you will so that is why that is why that outcome is there and that is all i had i am happy to answer any questions we are so excited about the strategic plan

or i am so excited about the strategic plan and i hope that comes through i have a question yes sir how did we do up to 2024 on our past strategic plan did we meet every goal 100 did we meet every goal 100 i do not have that number with me i would say likely not because we

did not have specific numbers for the for the current strategic plan that still is in place until august 31st we are gathering some baseline data right now which will serve not only to guide us on this incoming strategic plan but it will tell us where we are on the current tell us where we are on the current

plan so maybe in one of the upcoming board meetings you can bring us up to date and let us know how we did on the past sure absolutely happy to do that so that we do not skip something we missed in our next five years missed in our next five years absolutely i think that is a great

suggestion judge we had some in our strategic plan which at the time that we voted made sense for the institution it was prior to certain laws passing and so some of them it is not in our best interest to to report on i will give an example so our goals and outcomes goal two is drive student success

dr p is absolutely correct does not have specific metrics but we can provide data on those but for instance one of the goals under driving student success was close equity gaps and student outcomes that in today's body politic is not something that we would be reporting on which is based on senate bill seventeen that passed in 2023

but there is others that we can you know facilitating college transitions preparing students with marketable skills for gainful employment but we can we can bring a report to the board and show you as we launch this one this one will launch the one of september and we can bring we can make sure that we have time in

the fall to report to the board where we were on meeting those at the same time i reminded the board that strategic plan was during the pandemic co i give dr emily a whole lot of credit for getting that strategic plan up and running and through during the pandemic but i am sure there are goals that we

did not meet given the moment goals etc that the pandemic impacted and remind me again how do how do we monitor the progress we are making so the excellent question mrs moy and the strategic plan is so exciting because it is going to be how the budget heads are going to create their area plan so myself my

colleagues in the room any budget head at the college will be generating a new area plan for the academic year they will pick one of these metrics to focus on we will have the baselines for at the aggregate level they can try at the aggregate level they can try to say for example number one on the screen

i am going to focus on a an area plan targeting career exploration in and out of the classroom by five so we will have that baseline number they may they are going to outline how they are going to do it they have quarterly updates that they provide and so by the end of the year by next september

october of 26 they will have their baseline data they will have where they ended up they will have the interim steps along the way they can say you know i did it yay me or they can say i did not quite hit that mark i want to extend the plan and double up my effort so it is

more at the individual level but it is accountability through our actually through the software that you all were so kind to approve at last week's board meeting that software was to document the planning efforts at the college at any point they can re-trigger at any point they can re-trigger evaluation absolutely they do not have to generate a

new plan every year they are welcome to or they can extend the plan sometimes work takes a little bit more than a year to achieve so and when we are doing any type of expenses do we point back to how is this expense going to tie to this specific action well we tie the planning into the budget

development process so our director of institutional planning comes to the budget workshop presentations in february to align that because it is resource allocation and it justifies to our stakeholders not only how we are using those resources but if we might need additional resources for a specific purpose not just i need more money for xyz but you know

tying everything we do back to that strategic plan in support of the mission and plan in support of the mission and vision thank you thank you mhm good work okay thank you so much all right item five two mr fernando flores vice president of finance and administration cfo will provide an update on the development of the 2025

2026 fiscal year development of the 2025 2026 fiscal year budget no let the record show that miss nara has wait good afternoon chair hagerty members of the board dr sata thank you for the opportunity to present the second budget development workshop of the year the first being on june the 25th was the initial board budget workshop and

so my name is fernando flores i am the vice president of finance and administration i am supported by miss anna zuniga associate vice president budget and finance as well as miss laura deis the budget well as miss laura deis the budget director at the june 25th budget workshop i had said that the main goal is developing a

sustainable budget well that has not changed it is still the main goal to produce a sustainable budget the other thing that we talked about were that on june 25th many of the numbers that were presented were preliminary so we are a little bit of over a month later and the numbers have firmed up quite a bit we

have better numbers better estimates for expenditures and so today we are going to look at the numbers of these as they have rolled forward and go over that in a little bit more detail so our agenda today is just to say that one budget workshop is under our belt it is provided on june the 25th and so

now we have updated the baseline budget as of june 30th at the june 25th presentation it was updated through may the 31st it is advanced by one month and we have updated the revenues for fiscal year 2425 which become the basis for the 2526 budget so it is very important to update the current revenues to predict what

the revenues might be for next year in addition dr sarat has vetted the additional request with the vice presidents that are in attendance presidents that are in attendance today and so you are going to see revised funding strategies based upon updated revenue projections and this will help in your decision- making later as you consider a salary increase

so then we will at the end of the presentation talk about next steps towards developing a fiscal year 2526 operating budget so how does the current year budget so how does the current year budget revenues how do the current budget year revenues how do the current budget year revenues look so for state appropriations we see we have

a positive variance of four nine have a positive variance of four nine million that is about 175 that is about close to the number we predicted at the june 25th budget workshop up eleven overhead recovery is slightly down 84 zero a minimal amount and so when we look at local funds tuition and fees at the june 25th

presentation they were up about three five million they were predicted much higher we have since looked at our revenue projections and gotten a better view of what the summer exemptions are which exemptions are a contra revenue account so we adjusted the tuition and fees we expect for this year down so that is a significant difference from what

we reported june the 25th this is a more accurate prediction of where the revenues will be and so property taxes are coming that is a positive variance of two seven million approximately three 65 three 65 higher other income is still trending higher that the large component of that is interest income so that is four eight million higher

it there is such a large variance because interest income is something that is hard to predict and very variable so we budget conservatively for interest income but interest rates have remained fairly high the fed has not changed rates yet but the world is very dynamic and that can happen very quickly so we do not rely on interest

income as a stable revenue source but at the moment it is yielding a nice variance four eight million dollars positive so we come down to the self-supporting line item it shows self-supporting shows a budget of three million and we have revenues predicted of one six million that shows a decrease on here but really because we are showing

actual revenues to budget it shows a decrease but the self-supporting accounts we do not spend more than the revenue that comes into them that is a very important aspect to keep in mind we are not going to go into any kind of deficit when it comes to self-supporting we only spend and monitor those accounts very closely in

in that area so overall the way that revenues look they we have a increase of eleven nine million almost twelve million over budgeted revenues yes sir just because i am old and i forget things can you just couple examples of what self-supporting really is i mean what are those sure so many times the workforce area is very

dynamic it wants to respond to industry demand to respond to industry demand okay so they want to pilot a program to see if it is viable and if it is viable the rules call for them mainstreaming that account into the operating budget okay i understand i am just misconception when you say supporting misconception when you say supporting

program yes sir are there any other questions about this slide so the takeaway from here is when we look at budgeted revenue is 166 five million compared to what actually we predict is going to come in there is a positive variance of almost twelve million positive variance of almost twelve million 719 increase so looking at the current

year as well how that is going to wind up this is our prediction for how operations are going to finish this year this particular slide incorporates revenues and our projected re expenditures so we see that we have brought forward we have brought forward the projected revenues of 178 five million which is a positive variance of almost twelve

million we saw that on the previous slide so now what we do over here we estimate expenditures and we estimate our expenditures to come in at 148 six expenditures to come in at 148 six million resulting in a positive variance of 29 eight million for the year that is our prediction the surplus that is resulting from this

helps to bolster fund balance which is looked on very positively by sac coc rating agencies and also allows us to continue the practice of supporting deferred maintenance projects in the plant funds so we have a lot of need in the area of maintaining buildings and grounds so forth so the college is very fortunate this year and last

year as well to contribute to addressing deferred maintenance needs so this is a result of what we expect for so looking forward towards next year's budget development this is a strategic plan for that so as a review planning for revenues the appropriation that we are going to talk about is a result of the 89th legislative session which

i think is been extended dr and so a result also of the 88th legislature where the house bill historic house bill eight was greatly impacted and so our revenues for the appropriation have changed greatly they are based upon performance measures and the payment methods that they have implemented are different from the past in the past we'd be

funded on a bianium basis we get an appropriation we usually be good for two years so now that static model has changed to a more dynamic one it is based upon about seventeen different performance measures and so very different and also the payment system that they have implemented is different as well so that is the model that

we are currently operating under tuition and currently operating under tuition and fees the tuition and fees line item here we have reviewed our tuition and fees estimate and as i mentioned the tuition and fees from the current year largely go to predict what we are going to receive next year and we budget that way it is a

very conservative way of budgeting what you are receiving now and then you budget that way expect that in the future so that is typically what we do but what we also do we keep an eye on enrollment and as a result we have been looking almost every day at our enrollment numbers for the fall and that is

trending lower our fall enrollment is showing some decreases and so we have to consider the risk of that into our budgeting so we have lowered our expectation for tuition and fees by one million as a result of what we are seeing for enrollment for this fall now that does not mean that that is the ultimate number we

are going to use because as you know the budget is presented on august the 27th to the board for approval so between now and august 27th our enrollment may get better to the extent where we adjust our revenue estimates what is our past information show that it has increase between those weeks the past information shows that we

had a slight increase at this point in time and at this point in time we have a very small decrease predicted but at this point in time last year we show that we were we had a positive so right now it is not positive it is it is showing a negative number so we consider that as we

develop our tuition and fees prediction and we will continue to do that all the way up until we finalize and present a final budget for you so it may go up or if it needs to go down a little bit it'll be it'll be decreased as well the nice thing about what the college has done historically to

budget for this to mitigate that risk of enrollment declining the college maintains a bianium reserve that bianium reserve is meant for just such a situation we are currently flat judge we are at 18810 right now we were at 18857 last year we have seen the enrollment process tighten as we have gotten closer to the fall semester in

in contradiction with what we saw in the spring we saw a very healthy spring five increase in the spring the summer was very healthy as well significant increase this summer all of those are indications that we expect to see a strong fall but it is weakening as we get closer and so i asked vice president flores to

adjust the budget accordingly i did not want there to be any surprises and so it is we are much more conservative with the budgeting process so i asked that he adjust the budget and particularly tuition and fee revenue accordingly i if anyone has specific questions i'd ask dr maya from his thing for dr maya to jump in

just real quick you mentioned something about the current session is there any realistic or expectation or current special sessions but does that really set the special session with other things so the special session it is a great question structure lots of different items on special session which essentially we know there are many of our legislators not in

austin and so we will see what ends up happening i would imagine the governor will call a second special session and potentially more so the maps have come to completion there is an item on the special agenda that pertains to us specifically and it is tax rate now that will not affect this current year's budget but that

could affect the college budget going forward i do not know if you have any judge or any other member has any other questions on enrollment again we are continuing to run enrollment and we will run enrollment through the first week of class we allow some schedule adjustments and then obviously dual credit early college high school will continue

to work with our district partners all the way up until census date and actually i remind the board that we have many throughout so even on census date when we reported enrollment that is not the final enrollment because we have many that go out throughout the fall term please sure so point time is so as i mentioned

we are basically flat with 47 students down from last semester at the same date classes start august 25th we have several campaigns going on right now where we are reaching out to students who have enrolled haven't completed their fa or need to complete their fa so we have internal campaigns going on trellis is one of our partners

as well they are assisting us with those students needing assistance with financial aid so we continue to ask students also as dr sa mentioned through dual credit early college high school enrollment because we still receive those rosters from our isd partners so we are working to get our enrollment keep our enrollment up and also wherever we end

up today the really important number is where we end up at census date which is september ten so we work really hard to get our students enrolled and sorry yeah we work hard to get our students enrolled and paid by the by census date so we try to reduce the number of students that we end up having

to drop for a non-payment so lots of campaigns going on and we still have extended hours coming up this saturday august 16th ten zero a m to two zero p m august 23rd ten zero a m to two zero p m as well as extended hours the week before classes start and the first two days of enrollment

as dr sata mentioned this will allow students to enroll as long as a class hasn't met or via a petition through a dean have we done any analysis on how many students are not returning or how many we expected to return but are not i can look at we do see what our continuing student enrollment looks like

so we all summer long we are looking very healthy it is been the past couple of weeks that we have seen this slowdown and one of the markers that we do look at is our continuing students so that is where we have seen a little bit of decline so there are there are captive audience so we are

reaching out to those students as well if they to those students as well if they enrolled haven't graduated enrolled in spring or summer and not enrolled in fall we are so we are going to continue looking at tuition and fees and adjust accordingly up until we present you a final budget on august the 27th the next item

are property taxes this is a number that has been finalized in the budget on july the 25th we received the certified valuations from the cad and our valuations went up about four six billion to 73 46 to 73 46 billion and also we had new property valued at one five billion and resulting in a no new revenue

rate of ten 3563 cents per 100 valuation that is down from ten 77 almost half a penny down so that is driving our ability to raise tax revenue should the college ever need that as a reminder we are capped at fifteen cents per 100 valuation so anything driving our rate lower is good for the future should it

be needed now planning for additional funding request today one of the items on the agenda is consideration of a salary increase so the presentation before that on the budget is to inform what the capacity is for the district to fund a salary increase and also additional funding requests that have been presented by the executive levels that you

are going to see in just a little bit at this point in time what has changed from june the 25th is that dr has had a chance to vet the additional request and dropped them by close to half a million dollars so it is a significant decrease and so there is going to be continued impact from the

gazsby 68 and 75 on unrestricted net position that is a very variable amount we depend on the information from the state which we do not have yet but still it is something that needs to be considered it averages about four million impact to our fund balance every year and so an additional gazsby that anna and her team

are working on in accounting is gazby 101 compensated absences these are things that we are mandated to follow by the governmental accounting standards board otherwise we would get an unmodifi we would not get an unmodified opinion and the financial statements that the college produces are super important to receive the appropriation to get pel and are viewed by

many granting agencies so a very important document to the a very important document to the district so looking at our performance tier this is our appropriation this is not changed from the june 25th presentation looking at the terminology near final this is a terminology from the coordinating board so that implies that there might be some changes to

that so but that is the best number that we have for appropriation i will tell you that 43 nine million is a projection by the coordinating board on what we are going to earn as appropriation once we report our actual enrollment numbers to the coordinating board it will be different from that but we do not know by

how from that but we do not know by how much so that number will change either a little bit or a lot we do not know at this point it is the best number that we have so far and so that is the cr some of the criteria that now go into the criteria that now go into

the appropriation that is very different from the bienium funding that we used to receive so house bill eight also changed the way we receive that particular appropriation and any future appropriations in coming years so we just have to be aware of how the funding for appropriation comes in it comes in three installments now which is different from

the past used to come in ten installments so the state has changed not only the performance measures but how they distribute the other state funding the financial aid for swift transfer fast is budgeted at five six million so that has gone up 175 zero from the presentation on june the 25th the reason that has gone up is

because now we have received the allocation for the fall of 2024 we know what that amount is and then also we num we know what the numbers that were reported for the spring so since miss zuniga had that information she was up to able to update her revenue projection for the fast also keep in mind that the

state increased the funding from the state increased the funding from 56 87 56 87 cents per semester credit hour to cents per semester credit hour to 58 52 58 52 cents per semester credit hour as far as benefits are concerned for the first time in several years the state has raised the premium rates for health insurance they

raised them by eight and so the state currently funds our health insurance at about close to 50 they do not provide us funding for physical plant personnel however we have to budget for that and the grants pay for their own health insurance benefits however due to the eight increase that is going to result in a must be

funded or critical item that you are going to see on the additional funding request of 74 zero you are going to see in a little while the reason is the state increased our rate by eight we incur close to seven million of u health insurance costs that we fund and so you can do the extension on that

there is no change so just as a reminder last presentation we talked about the change in the purchasing mandatory bidding requirement from 50 to 100 zero and the board discussed this particular item and agreed that for the next coming fiscal year the board would also like to see competitive processes that are done for anything valued at 100

zero or more the college is working to update its procedures or purchasing procedures with regard to this and you will see that in the august this and you will see that in the august 27th board meeting so now we look at the projection for revenues for 2526 so as i mentioned the current year is the basis for

projections going into the future and largely that is what this future and largely that is what this represents on the state appropriations line we show an increase to the appropriation compared to the current year that is a result of the college performing better on its performing on its performance measures that were reported last year last year the

college received a four seven million dynamic adjustment over what the coordinated board had predicted for us that was a very positive result for the year this appropriation increase largely reflects that and also the increase in the fast funding rate from 56 to 58 per semester credit hours overhead recovery we predict a small decrease of 84 zero there

on the local funds tuition and fees we have a small decrease predicted there we are continuing to look at this item this is item we talked about we are looking at the fall enrollment and we will adjust accordingly leading up to the final budget presentation either up or down we are going to adjust it the idea is

to produce a sustainable budget and that is our key objective and so property tax property taxes now that we have the certified valuations and the no new revenue rate we predict that we are going to receive at least 75 two million in property tax revenue the property tax revenues we budget very conservative conservatively for those the big

the big thing on that is that the certified values that the cad provides the taxing entities are discounted about two eight so when the college receives those values they are lower by two eight because they are they are predicting what refunds and lawsuits may result in so the government agencies like that because it results in a more

conservative budget just in case you have a large refund or large lawsuit that may happen so our property tax revenue is based upon a certified rate two eight lower however when property tax owners are mailed their statements those do not contain that discount so generally we receive more revenue than what we budget because the cad is very

good at resolving those protests and so the cad the city collects 100 of the valuation that they mailed out but we budget conservatively and in doing so we are major increase other income we continue to budget interest income very conservatively at five million as i said interest income is something that is unpredictable not something that is sustainable

so we do not build our budget on that we failed five million is very achievable even if the fed cutting rates by more than half we would still be able to support our budget and the future does not predict that kind of decline in rates so we feel confident about what we budgeted for so we see overall

the take the takeaway here is this 173 nine million is our total projected revenues for next year we cannot exceed that as we develop a budget so that is our line in the sand it is an increase of seven four million over budgeted revenues so how do those budgeted revenues what how do they look like in terms

of source of funding property taxes continue to be the largest revenue source at 43 27 75 two million followed by appropriations almost 50 million tuition and fees those are the three largest revenue sources and then we have other income self-supporting and overhead recovery so this is showing the previous slide by percentage of revenue source and so we

get to the baseline budget this is a result of all the budget submissions by the executive levels all the vice presidents and associate vice presidents so the budget office works to compile all of these budgets review them and so those budget submissions also include additional requests that we are going to talk about in a little bit but

this is the baseline budget this is nothing above what they had the year before so u the baseline budget shows a decrease of one million that reflects the movement of positions people leaving the college at a high salary and then the recruit the people recruited coming in at the lower salary so that largely is the result of

that so you see an increase in the baseline budget from 2425 2526 which is the middle column 2425 2526 which is the middle column continue and so the other section in here is the self-supporting area and they always budget at break even they cannot exceed what they have budgeted for so that is budgeted at break even no

effect on the baseline budget so then this baseline budget so then this baseline budget reflected by functional area would be distributed like this so dr smith is still in the range here at 54 seven million 33 eleven of the budget and then followed by support at almost 50 million 30 academic support which also belongs to dr twenty

three million twelve 28 and operations and maintenance physical plant thirteen million student services twelve seven transfers three five public service three 83 and research at 214 zero so this is the way that the baseline budget is allocated by functional area so you see the same baseline budget distributed by expense categories so in here the largest category is

faculty salaries of 34 thirteen and then you can see in the block here how that details out between full-time and part-time faculty and then over here staff salaries close to 50 million you see the detail between full-time and part-time over here and overtime and then followed by supplies and services 28 million seventeen of the budget benefits fourteen

million transfer seven five contingency six five travel one three equipment one so this is how the expenses break out for the baseline budget the interesting thing here if you add faculty salaries staff salaries and benefits you get real quick some time ago there was a question about having enough parttime split between part-time and full-time faculty i think

is there any question about them do we evaluations are we still okay there we are to date mr xer so what mr xer is referencing is gosh twelve years ago we had a sachs on-site visit our accrediting agency sacl southern association of colleges and schools commission on colleges did a visit and they broke down our faculty ratios

in a different manner than they had ever done before we are one accreditation one college five campuses six sites total and what they did this is more in particular for you is they came in and they said they looked at every single program on every single campus and deemed that we had to have full-time faculty at each

of those programs and and campuses that caused the institution we were put on we had to raise taxes and hire 55 additional full-time faculty the course of the year prior to that they looked at us as a district and we covered between 47 and 52 full-time faculty in any one of those given terms during that the five

years preceding when they came we were just under 48 we turn around we hired those full-time faculty dr smith and his team did a tremendous job of hiring again 55 additional full-time faculty we were taken off morning the following summer and at one point i believe that we had 72 of our sections taught by full-time faculty despite

the ratio so you see that the full-time faculty salaries are just over the part-time faculty but our full-time faculty teaches the bulk of the courses the last time i saw was 72 i am not sure where we are now yeah i think we are down around 68 currently every position that becomes available or is requested for faculty

gets discussed at leadership for instructional deans and edps talk about every single position we look at the ratios that are being referred to across the district before we make a determination on the point we do not have any we are not concerned about great question structure bringing me back to the actual question we just had an accrediting

site visit we were in 23 this was not anything that came up with with the site visit or the off-site visit we were found in compliance with the ratio fulltime so you do not you do not worry about it the next time is in 2020 where it'll come up and they will look at that closely want to

make sure that we are always in a good to make sure that we are always in a good position so this is a look at what the additional funding requests for 2526 are under the critical needs overall there is a request for one seven million what changed from the june 25th presentation is we had initially submitted a

request for 264 zero in increase in insurance premiums well now the insurance carriers have provided what they are going to what they are going to ask for insurance so we lowered that to what the increase is for insurance rates so that has been lowered and then as i mentioned earlier the increase of eight to the health insurance

originally we had estimated 450 zero we were off on that we were too low we updated our numbers our projections for health insurance costs eight of that cost has resulted in 74 zero that we need for health insurance the other must be funded items have not changed from the last presentation under the other funding request from executive

levels that is decreased from two four million down to one 956 a decrease of about 400 zero a little over 400 zero the main decrease came in the instruction and workforce education area so that is the main so this slide is a compilation of the big numbers that we saw for total projected revenues the first row shows

the number that we covered under total projected revenues 173 nine million so we cannot exceed that that is going to be our top of the top of the budget line and the baseline preliminary budget is 165 four million i am looking in the no salary increase column just to start a review of this particular slide it results

in a budget surplus of eight point around eight five budget surplus of eight point around eight five million so how is that allocated well we have must be funded the increases that are mandatory that we have to cover of one seven million and then recall at the june 25th budget presentation workshop we talked about the six adjustment

to the salary tables where anybody making less than ten an hour would be brought up to ten that was about 200 zero of this particular line item request and the difference was a six increase to the entry levels on the tables which will allow for recruitment and retaining staff so that is what that 672 zero is all

about in the no salary increase column it results in a surplus before additional request of six one million and so we looked at the additional request of one nine million so if there was no salary increase there would be a surplus of four one million so the way this slide is laid out a one this includes for

the related this includes for the related benefits for a salary increase as well so in the one call you then see when you plug that number in it results in a increase in banium reserve of three one increase in banium reserve of three one million so as you move across the columns here and look at the three

column you see that the value of a three salary increase is a little over three million and results in an increase to the benium if you continue across a five would result in a need to go into benium reserve a negative amount of almost a million negative amount of almost a million dollars what does the fed expect

inflation to be this year the inflation rate right now is i think about two four dr somewhere yeah it rose to two seven two seven but i think the current ratio shows it trending down once again it is a great question judge you and economists will continue to try and figure that out they do anticipate that inflation

will start to get closer to two at the end of this year going yes sir look at this the bottom line additional requests going to the previous page it said additional funding requests for 2025 ed says critical needs must be funded one seven million and then he said other funding requests and i do not see as must

be requested but the total of all of that is 44 zero less under two million but we take all of that do i take that to mean that even though it is not must be funded we are going to say we are going to fund all of those requests at the requested amount so in other words that

one 956 million is as accepted it is my revenue to yes okay why would it be preliminary you mean just because whole budget's preliminary so are there any other questions relating related to the funding strategy relating related to the funding strategy options so what are the next steps the next steps are there is an item today to

approve a salary enhancement by the board of trustees after that at the august 27th board meeting acceptance of the certified appraisal rule adoption of the 2526 budget which will continue to be budget which will continue to be evaluated adoption of the 2025 tax rate august 27th as well and then on september the 2nd laura and her team

will roll the budget into banner and our fiscal year begins september so this is a large team effort everybody has a piece of the pie here special thanks to miss deas in her office livana venica and abp zuniga for her revenue estimates and in my office shout out to juanita martinez and lucia and serio who have worked

tirelessly on this presentation they have been awesome and miss shaughnessy is still a force she provides guidance and oversight on pieces of this all the way from france and so dr sarata and his initial meetings in may evaluating additional requests and guidance on different aspects of this as well as my colleagues who have are not shy about

voicing their input thank you to all of them and so especially to the board of trustees for receiving this presentation and any questions you may have had with that thank you thank have any questions okay thank you sir you are welcome as always great job thank you always great job thank you five three five three item five

three discussion and action to approve salary increases for employees of the el paso county community college recommendation judge working with the cabinet members as well as mr sixteen in budget my recommendation to the board to entertain for your consideration to look at a salary enhancement of three that provides again a cost of living adjustment as well as

dealing with inflation and at the same time not having a budget so tight that we are only seeing a 48 zero miami reserve this would allow us to a three asset would allow us to still maintain approximately a million dollar miami reserve i'd remind the board that based on an outcomes model the state appropriations will change annually

and we have been fortunate based on the good work of everyone at the college led by my colleagues on my left that we have been able to see state appropriations go up since we implemented this new funding model in 2023 and we have gone up annually there will come a time where we will see an adjustment downward

based on things that the state is putting in place i remind the board they are not funding all associate degrees any longer it went from ten years to five years in one bienium we we are losing funding for six associates degrees it does not mean we are going to stop providing those to students we are going to

try to get them through faster and get them to transfer as quickly as possible but it is my recommendation that the board entertain a three salary enhancement for the a three salary enhancement for the institution okay i have a motion move to approve okay i have a motion move to approve three second any discussion call a question

call a question mr hi miss nah miss nah hi mrs robless mrs robless i mrs moy mrs moy hi mr hagerty mr hagerty all right all right now i have a question you said we are not funding six of the six of our what are the titles biology what are the titles biology psychology let me thank the
