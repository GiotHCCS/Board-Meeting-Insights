association the faculty association surprise is gone the surprise is coming sorry good evening members of the board president serata staff and guests my name is laura gaither and i am president of classified staff i am here to discuss a matter that is not only crucial for the well-being of our employees but also for the sustained success and

growth of our institution the need for a pay raise for our dedicated workforce first and foremost i want to acknowledge the incredible efforts and resilience our employees have demonstrated especially over the past few years they have navigated unprecedented challenges with unwavering commitment and have consistently delivered exceptional results their hard work has been instrumental in achieving our strategic

goals and maintaining the mission of the el paso community college the cost of living has been steadily increasing impacting our employees ability to maintain their standard of living by adjusting their pay to reflect these changes we can ensure they are not only able to meet their basic needs but also thrive competitive compensation is a key factor in

retaining top talent our employees are our greatest asset and by investing in them we are investing in the future of this institution a pay raise will boost morale reduce turn turnover and foster a more engaged and motivated workforce in a competitive job market offering attractive compensation packages is essential to attract skilled professionals by pro providing a pay

raise we position ourselves as an employer of choice capable of drawing in the best and brightest talent not only making it a great place to start for students but making it a great place to start a career as well when employees feel valued and fairly compensated they are more likely to go above and beyond in the roles

this leads to increased productivity higher quality work and greater innovation all of which contribute to our student and college mission success i understand that financial considerations are paramount however i believe that the long-term benefits of a pay raise far outweigh the initial costs our suggestion for staff would be to get six as only getting three for a

person making 40 zero equals to them seeing about 80 in their paycheck which does not cover a trip to getting daily essentials at the trip to getting daily essentials at the supermarket additionally the positive impact on employee performance and retention will ultimately lead to greater financial returns for the institution in conclusion providing a pay raise for our

employees is not just a gesture of goodwill it is a strategic investment for apcc's future our employees have shown us time and again that they are backbone of our success it is our responsibility to ensure they are compensated fairly for their hard work compensated fairly for their hard work and dedication thank you for considering a six proposal

i am confident that together you can make a decision that will benefit both our employees and our institution thank you for your time and attention let us continue to build a brighter future for our students and our brighter future for our students and our invaluable i have a slideshow tonight epcc and the terrible horrible no good very

bad bill known as sb37 with thanks to judith fiorst for those of you who remember that book way those of you who remember that book way back when from the declaration of independence the history of the president lieutenant governor and dominant political party of texas is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object

the establishment of an absolute tyranny over texas public colleges and universities to prove that to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world thus i offer a comparison between epcc and sp37 comparison one epcc faculty association and faculty association and faculty senate are established by and operated by the epcc faculty association operated by the epcc

faculty association bylaws sb37 the epcc board of trustees will establish a brand new faculty association senate by adopting a policy governing the selection of the faculty councils or senate's members presumably without faculty input comparison two faculty members elect one full-time and one adjunct atlarge senator from each of the six epcc campuses and two full-time senators from each

academic division under sp37 at large senators are eliminated and it allows for two senators from each acade academic division one of whom is elected by the division's faculty and one of whom is appointed by the epcc president congratulations on your new president congratulations on your new job description comparison three the faculty association full-time vice faculty association full-time

vice president it should be the faculty association president full-time vice president and secretary are granted paid release hours under sb37 members of the faculty council or senate are not entitled to compensation or reimbursement of expenses comparison four the faculty association officers and faculty senators serve terms of two years and are not subject to term limits under sp37

faculty senators are appointed faculty senators appointed by the epcc president may serve up to six consecutive one-year terms and may only be reappointed after a two-year absence elected senators serve one two-year term and can only be reelected after a two-year absence comparison four the faculty associates and executive committee consisting of the president full-time vice president adjunct vice

president and secretary are elected by the faculty for a term of two years and can be reelected under sb37 the epcc president with the advice and consent of the board of trustees shall appoint a presiding officer associate presiding officer and secretary from the members of the faculty council or senate an additional job for youine people comparison six

sometimes the epcc faculty associ association senate passes resolutions that do not need administrative consent such as approving the minutes or the resolution passed this academic year urging all faculty to be courteous and aware of the 10-minute time between classes under sp37 a faculty council or senate is advisory only and may not be delegated the final decision-making authority

on any matter presumably that means administration or the trustees or both must approve everything the association senate passes including the mundane resolutions such as those stated above why this ridiculous bill is being advocated by the dominant political party of texas all because lieutenant governor dan patrick is throwing what i call a hissy fit because the ut austin

faculty senate had the audacity to pass a resolution opposing something patrick was in favor of said political party claims to be the defender of democracy in america yet this bill is nothing less nothing less than a blatant attempt by that party and patrick to destroy democracy in texas public colleges and universities because they believe without any proof

whatsoever that quote ludy marxist professors are supposedly indoctrinating students to hate america and turn them into socialists and communists in fact political party and the lieutenant governor are attempting to indoctrinate students to their own far-right propagandistic beliefs to paraphrase the declaration of independence my favorite political document lieutenant governor dan patrick and the dominant political party of texas

have dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness their invasions on the rights of the people they have made boards of trustees you find people dependent on their will alone they have erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance dang bunch of out their

substance dang bunch of cannibals they have combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unagnowledged by our laws giving their assent to their acts of pretended legislation they have taken away our bylaws abolishing our most valuable laws altering fundamentally the forms of our government they have suspended our own senates and declaring

themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever a lieutenant governor and dominant political party whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler over tyrant is unfit to be the ruler over free people a resolution by the epcc faculty senate whereas senate bill 37

seeks to totally dissolve and destroy the el paso community college faculty senate whereas sb37 proposes to totally dissolve the epcc faculty association bylaws and replace them with bylaws created by the epcc board of trustees and whereas sb37 proposes severely limited who can be on the faculty senate and whereas sb37 proposes to have certain senators appointed by the

epcc president instead of elected by the faculty and whereas sb37 proposes to have the faculty associated exe executive committee appointed by the president and approved by the board of trustees instead of elected by the faculty and whereas sp37 proposes that senators appointed by the college president are limited to six consecutive one-year terms and the faculty elected senators

are limited to one two-year term and can only be reelected after the second anniversary of the last day of the member's most recent term and whereas sb37 proposes to destroy the democratic way the epcc faculty senate has chosen and operates the epcc faculty senate duly assembled does hereby condemn and oppose this undemocratic vile and repugnant sb37 as

it is currently proposed done as 14th day of april in the year 2025 revised on sec 22nd day of april in the year 2025 under sp37 you the members of the ep epcc board of trustees will have to approve this very resolution what will approve this very resolution what will you do thank you oh and by the

way i was reelected president of the way i was reelected president of the senate congratulations thank you thank you sir what are you going to do about this section one eight communications item one eight one discussion and review regarding data statistics policies and general information related to el paso community college by the board of trustees dr graham

mr vj smith of ver marathon petroleum a great partner and funding partner of el paso community college vj would you like to come up and say hello to come up and say hello good afternoon president and members of the board of trustees it is an honor to be before you and before dr graass gives this presentation i

just want to convey how proud i am of dr grass her staff and our current board for the foundation this is an amazing group of professionals in business industry and in the community they are relentless about the vision and mission of el paso community college and they are relentless in terms of ways of raising money and keeping

our foundation dollar amounts high on average to 250 zero a year for scholarships and student emergency aid and also want to thank dr mo for her overarching support as well so thank you thank you m thank you sir thank you vj i'd like to share with you this evening some recent updates and as vj said the mission

vision and strategic goals of el paso community college are the mission and vision of your epcc foundation we are your affiliated nonprofit foundation to raise funds for el paso community college students and to support epcc programs we provide scholarship funding to help epcc students achieve high value credentials and partner with local companies like marathon petroleum that vj

represents and employers to provide funds and to develop our region's skilled workforce we collaborate with faculty and staff across the college to identify program and student needs and to raise funds to support students so to help students stay on track including their emergency needs and investing in the college foundation is an investment in college foundation is an

investment in epcc students i'd like to share with you our foundation board officers for this year vj smith as i mentioned chair vanessa aguilad at tanya costan jabaro is our vice chair thomas gabriel at westar bank is our treasurer and miriam gueredo the cfo of workforce solutions borderlex is our board secretary on our board this year we

have two new members miss mariana benvidas of the woody and gail hunt family foundation and dr andrea tani from texas tech el paso who is a vice president there so you will see our board members and they are all advocates for el paso community college many of them are also funders of epcc through their contributions for student

scholarships and our programs in the past ten years the foundation has awarded almost two zero scholarships one 940 scholarships and over two million to epcc students i have here for you some of our outcomes data and i am looking forward to working with dr penley staff at institutional research because we track our students each semester and at

the end of each academic year to see how they are doing so we know that 68 of epcc foundation scholarship awardees graduate in three or fewer years and their average grade point average is three 43 and so we are looking forward to more graduates coming up in may and this summer and we know that so far the

board has projected to award 210 zero almost 211 zero for scholarships to epcc students for the coming academic year beginning in fall here's some additional data for you so in the past ten years one 51 epcc foundation scholarship awardees have graduated and last year there were 165 graduates and again we are looking forward to some in may

and perhaps some finishing in summer and again we follow them we know who they are we know what majors they achieved u their certificates and degrees and we know exactly how many transfer and go on to achieve additional credentials i wanted to mention the star scholarship fund these awards will be coming up this is with one of

our very active foundation partners the star scholarship fund founded by lnf distributors they have been our foundation partner since 2014 and through that partnership more 2014 and through that partnership more than 562 zero has been awarded to epcc students the foundation matches that funding dollar for dollar so we have to raise that money from the private sector

and so that is really the benefit of the upcc foundation we are out working with the private sector to raise those funds to bring them to the college and so our match contribution 281 zero and so we know that there are 76 students currently here at epcc awaiting good news to see if they have been selected for

a scholarship to enroll for fall and so that announcement will be forthcoming soon and so those students by the way that is a full tuition scholarship and many of them do complete here go on to transfer to universities and stars also partners with utep so we know that many of them also then go on and receive scholarships

when they complete here and mcdonald's el paso those awards are coming up on the 20th of may these are for graduating high school seniors and they have been a partner with the epcc foundation since 2019 the unique part about that partnership is that mr castro richard castro owner operator of 26 mcdonald's here in el paso would not

have kept this money local unless he had some partners so the epcc foundation partnered with mr castro beginning in 2019 and so everything that mcdonald's awards the epcc foundation matches and so that matching has resulted in 227 zero for epcc students and you will see there that the college foundation see there that the college foundation matched 113

zero of that 113 zero of that funding here's some good other good news for you and these are new funds that have come in recently the very end of the year kicking off 2025 but we have a number of donors and you will see the listing there barbara walker from cisco and again that partnership cisco match it

matched that partnership cisco match it matched her contribution so that is almost a twenty zero contribution we have the northeast rotary club foundation the pan-american roundtable of el paso they started with us last year and set up a 25 zero endowment fund this year they contributed another five zero to their fund so that is a 30 zero

plus fund for el paso community college students we have some other donors that are fairly new with us mr gilbert hendris he again awarded another five zero for students without really any criteria other than it go to anycccc to epcc students sentry insurance el paso citizens police academy alumni association a scholarship was awarded to a student about

three weeks ago they have been a partner these past several years and those were are students in the epcc law enforcement training academy and so a variety of new funds coming into the college another newer partner nusenda credit union here in el paso they purchased western heritage bank they really are focused on education and so the foundation

applied for funding competitively and we were awarded fifteen zero and so we wrote this to support dual credit students who want to come into epcc with scholarships because we know there are a number of students many of them in the high schools taking dual credit coursework that want to come on over to epcc and complete their degrees

here and we want to we wanted to make this an incentive for them to enroll after graduation from high school so this funding is targeted for dual credit students in the high schools coming over to el paso high schools coming over to el paso community college and save the date for 2025 fajitas and margaritas for scholarships this

past year's event we had 250 plus emphasis on the plus guests pretty much everybody that could fit into the facility 29 company sponsors and again those sponsors are funders bringing resources for epcc students into the college through this event we had 29 of them this past year and our highest fundraising proceeds to date we netted more than

87 zero that evening and so please save the date and join us again and we know that dr sedata the board of trustees administrators faculty and staff have been very supportive of this event it is fun we partner with el paso community college culinary arts and it is a really great opportunity to showcase epcc students in action

and we are very proud to host this event on behalf of the college and very proud to have the trustees dr sarata our administrators and faculty and staff with us at this event all for student benefit and our sponsors help every dollar raised at this be proceeds for students and coming up next week i know many of

you are attending ticket sales closed this evening they are online but we have a really exciting event to raise scholarship funding for el paso community college nursing students this will establish an endowment fund for epcc nursing students to help them get through school and we know that in tough coursework for nursing in many cases it is extremely

difficult or if not impossible for students to work outside the college especially when they are going through their clinical rotations they are required to be in clinical sites in many cases in the hospitals and so they really cannot work to earn money for school this fund and this fundraiser will help these students with scholarship resources to complete

their degrees here at epcc and so to share with you we have some new funding partners for this event again bringing in additional and new resources into the college so these are our funding partners and sponsors for this lunchon on may 7th next week texas tech health el paso texas tech school of nursing el paso children's hospital

the hospitals of providence utep university medical center u grand canyon university project ariba and tender care home health all of these educational institutions and healthc care providers did sponsorships because they knew this was an event to support student scholarships and many of our el paso community college graduates that want to go further in their education and achieve

the bachelors of science in nursing then transfer onward so it is an exciting event we do have some 1974 graduates attending the event a couple of them came into my foundation offices today and they were the first graduating class of epcc nursing and so they are coming and so that is next week may 7th ticket sales close

in making epcc night at the ballpark a success the evening was filled with school spirit community connection as well as unforgettable moments our apcc tv studio put together a short video of the of the new tahano music studio at the va campus and of epcc's night at the ballpark and it is coming up now and we have

the new tahano sun studio that we have here and we are very proud we just actually started and launched three new programs for the music department we are currently offering an associates of arts and science in audio engineering associates of arts and music business and then a certificate of completion in music technology which is a one-year track

we set off developing two tracks one for audio engineering and one for music business we just need to make this happen cuz they are going to come they are going to sign up for it and sure enough as soon as we open it up they are basically all my sections are full have a recording studio here at

epc studio and put it together so we got all the paperwork we did the course development they are going to learn how to record learn about live sound acoustics midi and as well as a music business and what it takes to run a business in recording and if they want to promote themselves it is such a it

is such a privilege right and of course it would be ideal for college to just be accessible for all right but we know that epcc is a much more accessible path here so the fact that we just started right off the bat not only learning so much about the fundamentals of sound how it is created how it

is recorded how it is captured but then getting immediate access to this facility to be able to practice those skills immediately that has been the biggest thrill and of course beyond that it is also the feeling of collaboration and they all went and wrote their own song and they are producing it completely been teaching audio engineering but

we want to immerse students and give them more knowledge within the music industry teach the business of music dan and i dan becker and i we went to la to the nam show the national association of music merchant show to find out about all this good equipment of recording and made our list and everything and gathered all

our information and put it together in our proposal and it got approved it got approved you know by the board and everything because this is something that we found out that teenagers in high school when they come out they love music and they want to record music they want to dive themselves into music and it goes to

show we have a waiting list here in here is our studio this is where we are going to be recording and it is completely soundproof our faculty member glenn leeler is one of the gentlemen who helped with the building of the room i built star city i built the a- room of sonic ranch i have been doing

it a long time eventually the name just kind of it just made sense and it is just it is a big honor especially cuz for me i specifically went into this to feel empowered to know exactly how to produce music that is always been a dream i have always been on the stage for years but i have

always wanted to know how to get behind the scenes so if you are interested in our program please give me a call again my name is dr melissa gurola you can find me at 915831-2875 and you can also email me my email is my email is mgurr1 epcc edu we hope to see you here i am excited

for it as you could tell and the students they are already busy all right night of football right night of football first dr graham members of the board that concludes my report thank you that was concludes my report thank you that was great dr graham i do i do have one question dr shrod brought up this the

standing of the community college and the military friendly school and as you point out we are designated as silver whereas they have gold as the top now given the facilities that we have and given the administration and the leadership that we have i find it hard to believe that i guess i'd like to know what the standards

they use to do that because maybe there is something out for us to learn but i thought i thought what we provided was you know what you so obviously there is some area of con that other people area of con that other people judge that might be beneficial for us to look at but otherwise i do not

see how anybody could top i mean you look at the new facilities they provide at trans mountain and via the leadership that we have here and with that the veterans we have the supporting the field particularly if we are competing against dallas and they do not have any kind of army there mr usher i certainly appreciate the

competitive spirit of your question we will certainly work with mr dwire and look at at the additional possibilities of services that we could offer to our veterans to try and see we have been we have been ranked silver for quite some time to look to see what it would take to reach gold status and then obviously we'd

love to be one of the top institutions that they that they mention in the magazine let me point out i am not seeking for gold status because it is gold understood you know if they have some area they think's important but it does not fit our needs here i would not worry about it but i do not

is that good any discussion i have a question yes sir i i am just curious what is involved in a the firing range that makes it deficient i mean what do we need to do to improve it if are we increasing the capacity of the weaponry are we increasing the ability is it just natural wear and tear

is it degrading i mean i am not questioning the money i am just questioning what what is the state of the facility and what is the state-of-the-art i will ask dr smith to weigh in mr mr doctor thank you for the question the law enforcement training academy is a little shopworn it is been in existence for almost

30 years it is a situation where the shooting range itself the targeting system that was originally installed is no longer going to be maintained and needs to be repaired so we are looking at redoing that entire targeting system as we were looking at that we also determined that the traps that capture the bullets that go down the

range have begun cracking and that is what you are seeing on the agenda tonight is replacing those bullet traps that are behind each one of the ranges it is not a situation where we are expanding the capacity it is just we are bringing it up to standards for current law enforcement okay i do not and the next

question i want take is criticism but wonder when you go through the budgetary and reviewing and the maintenance policies that you are looking at how come all of a sudden you know now we see that everything is worn and torn i mean and so you anticipate a three-year planning and maintenance program and all of a sudden what

we did was roughly a third i mean deficient by about a third i mean was were not we paying attention to the facilities earlier and it sort of except it was functional and the sandbags are stopping the bullets and so everything's stopping the bullets and so everything's okay it was not a situation where it happened all at

once for the targeting system when we were informed by the company that manufactured that they were no longer going to support it obviously that was something that got our attention we did stock up on some supplies to repair that facility for a number of years the bullet traps there are two cracked bullet traps out of the i

want to say 20ish shooting ranges that we have so we are being proactive and upon inspection the other bullet traps are indeed becoming shopworn and does that allow the bullet to go downrange do we have to worry about the ask me that again does that if they are cracked does that mean the bullet can go downrange there

there is no evidence that any bullets are escaping the track at the traps at this point just extra sandbags all do it excuse me thank you for the explanation that was on point on page 475 it was pretty good i have received compliments from a reliable source my brother who goes there and he likes the range quite

a bit he complimented the work that was done there so i am glad we are improving it any other comments improving it any other comments discussion mr exter i mrs robas i miss naha i mr menddees hi dr graham i item five two discussion and action on approval to increase the maximum contract award amount for three previously

awarded vendors and one additional vendor for the purchase of building materials supplies and or services for the remainder of the fiscal year 202425 doc dr graham on this last item if the board is inclined to approve this i would just kindly recommend to the board to identify those four vendors they are not included in the in the

do we have a second question mr exer i mrs robas i miss naha i mr mendes i dr graham i section six curriculum and instruction item six one discussion and action on the approval of a cooperation contract agreement from the texas higher education coordinating board in the amount of 300 zero move to approve very good very good

discussion did you want to tell us a little bit more about that dr smith if i go too long stop me this is something that gets me pretty excited it is exciting so under the last legislative session not this one of course we know house bill eight was passed which generally is considered the funding bill for community

colleges but embedded in that bill was also the creation of the opportunity high school diploma program and so last year we brought to the board a 100 zero grant as a planning year for the grant itself to develop the structure for the opportunity high school diploma program this money is being used to actually develop and implement it

so we are one of five colleges in the state of texas that has the ability to actually offer the program so faculty at the institution now are actually in the process of developing the high school curriculum the placement examinations and training counselors and advisers to do the placement for the high school part of the program which will

be completely competencybased in nature and so we anticipate enrolling our first cohort of students into this program in the fall do you anticipate a location where they are going to be clustered or are they just going to be in different campuses they will be all over the city we did not want to make them drive to one

particular campus being competency based we will have the ability to do this at multiple locations and was there any ever any discussion of considering younger ones i looked through it all to see if by any chance we could kind of pick up some of those kiddos that have dropped out at an earlier age but it does not

appear that i found any information that would support that because we have so many young people that are not able to access regular programs and they will not go back to the high schools will not go back to the high schools they are sixteen seventeen but yeah i do not know dr sha you want to tackle this

one we do not want to compete with high school recovery programs that some of the districts have now we do not and this legislation was specifically for eighteen and over i know that the districts can receive state funding up to the age of 26 but this is for students who have already reached an age where they theoretically

would have graduated from high school so we are only allowed to take the adult we are not allowed to deal with students that are under eighteen and do we have an idea of how many we might initiated with so we had contracted or been approached by a number of entities that have done some analysis in our region

we are looking at in the nature of 30 zero potential students that have not completed high school but are in the workforce somewhere in that age group now that is a huge number yeah part of this funding will be for marketing and outreach so that we can reach the desired population as you can imagine this particular population

is one of the more difficult ones to reach and some of the hurdles that are going to be there were probably going to be some of the ones that dropped out because they could not pass some of the state assessments and they just gave up so the criteria to you know have them enter the program are they

looking at any of that or how is that going to be yeah the criteria are pretty easy any student who did not complete high school and is of the appropriate age and interested in earning a college credential is eligible for the program regardless of how they dropped out or correct and as you can imagine you know there

could be somebody that dropped out as a senior one semester from graduating high school and others that may have dropped out as soon as they entered high school so there will be pathways and placements and supports for all those populations and i guess we are going to carefully recruit the staff that are going to serve them because

that is going to be a huge differences to we have a number of faculty that are really excited to serve this population already we have also asked our teacher prep faculty to help vet the high school curriculum and lies with our isd partners to make sure that the diploma that we are offering is appropriate and on par

with what the isds are offering well it is great news for our community thank you absolutely thank everybody that worked on or is working on this mr exer hi mrs robless hi miss nahara hi mr mendes hi dr graham i section seven student services there is none section eight community services there is none would the board like
