has just showed up to the meeting good evening good evening g ladies gentlemen thank you very much it is always an honor to be here to present to you all the audit report we appreciate the chance to do the audit services for youall and i will go ahead and start out like i as i usually enjoy starting

out saying congratulations it is been quite honestly a fantastic year and financial side the numbers are showing very strong numbers as we have told you before we do what is called a single audit where we have to look at your financial statements we look at the financial reporting are they in accordance with generally government acceptable accounting standards

are they in compliance with the accounting standards with regulations and do you have a strong internal control and i am going to say in all of the above the answer is yes you had very good controls we are required under our standards to present this to the full board full management and so that is what i am

doing here in front of you today i will try to keep it short sweet it is 100 and some odd pages i have got it down to just a few slides that hopefully will bring out the higher points we did have a full committee meeting with the council just a few weeks ago where we went more in

depth so i will give you if you do not mind the highlights but if you have any questions please do not hesitate to answer i do have my assistants here who helped throughout the audit so first of all what is our responsibility and these are required that i talk to you about these things if you do not

mind our responsibilities are to report on the financial data to report that we do testing and analyzing of the of the colleges internal control as i just indicated and then we test and analyze the college's compliance with the federal regulations management's responsibility you all have the responsibility of establishing and maintaining internal control that is what we test

and look at including monitoring of that internal control which i can tellest that is done made presentation to you all and seeing the monitoring that yall doing you have the responsibility of selection and application of the accounting principles this is thrown on with the chief financial officer and the accounting department and then the fair presentation of the

financial report to the governance committee so that you can establish quality and fair budgets and see that the budgets are ad here to so what did we do well the scope of what we did we take a look testing of the financial statements to make sure that the numbers are materially correct that you followed proper government till

accounting policies and procedures and that you had proper internal control over these notice i hit internal control quite a few times it is that important so what were the results of that well these were the highlights that i am ping pulling out of like i said the 100 plus page report your cash and investments increased by 30

million to 314 million this is how much you have in cash and what that indicates is the college has extreme liquidity at this point which is very strong very good and we haven't always had that but the last several years it is been growing stronger your current assets increase by 35 million all the way up to the

371 million your deferred outflow that was that pension plan i am going to call it problem that we brought in to you about five ten years ago one of our gb's and it had a huge effect of 70 plus million well this year it actually decreased by six million it is not a problem it is not an

issue and it is sitting on the books at nineteen million and all in all your total assets are sitting with an increase of 31 million all the way up to 629 million and by the way your total liabilities are 340 million so you have significant assets over your liabilities speaking of liabilities total liabilities as i said decreased

by five million to i am sorry to 288 with the deferred outflow which decreased by three seven million to 33 million so moral story is our issue related to the pension plan and the other postretirement costs have diminished significantly and there is no i would argue no concern and you are in good shape with the pensions and

we are not affecting financial statements with those issues anymore additional results what else did i pull out of the financial statement your net position i think i have told you before that is the capital that is the equity that the organiz that the college has for future funding for grant increased by 39 million all the way up

to 28 million operating revenue during the year increases the operating revenue by itself increased by a 816 zero non-operating revenue increased by six million and that is in spite of the fact that in previous year last year before this i should say we had 22 million of covid fund so the covid fund went away and yet we

still increased by6 million revenue from state appropriations increased by twelve million including five million on the new fast and then operating expenses increased by nine million and again being the college i argue operating expenses is a positive thing because it means you are helping the public helping the students those are pretty much the financial results what we

consider to see the significant issues coming out of there again is that the net pension plan liability actually decreased as i said before your pension discount rate stayed at seven these are things that always affect the board the other postretirement plan discount rate increase slightly to three 59 from i am sorry from 359 to three 81 and

the net pension divert outflow had a decrease so again no problems related there additional results are that the college is following government accounting principles monthly and annually and to me that is really important that is where i get to say you are getting good reports every single month we are not having to come in make any correction

and there were no audit adjustments during the year next couple of slides just additional results our opinion was clean opinion in all respects there were no material weaknesses there were no significant deficiencies on internal control there were no instances of non-compliance and the public funds investment act was in compliance these are the regulatory guidance items that we

have to touch on and here i do not worry i will not go through all these numbers but just if you look at that chart on the bottom half looking from right to left that is how much you have grown in the last five years in your equity in your net position you were at 128 million in

2020 and you are up to 38 million in your net equity in 2024 so just a tremendous increase in this short period and also what is important of that back in 2020 your 128 covered about fourteen of the expenditures of the college today we have twelve of our entire expenditure sitting in our equity account nothing can say

that you are in a stronger position that in my opinion how did these numbers occur and again just showing you some of the general numbers your total operating revenue operations haven't really increase you have had a reduction in students over the covid period you are cting me back and so you are at 34 million in operating revenue

five years ago jumped it up to 31 a year ago and up to 32 million this year so we are itching our way back up in operating revenue and that is basically our tuition and the student type fees our non-operating revenues which is the state and federal government subsidies subsidizing is all the way up to 194 compared

to 174 years ago and 188 just last year so tremendous increase in your government of subsidies and funding so all in all your total revenue jumped up to 227 from the 204 million over a ten increase in this 5year period in total revenue whereas your expenditures have actually dropped because again with fewer students you have fewer overhead

costs related to it so you are this past year spent 187 million in the operations of the college this allowed you to put an extra 39 million onto the bottom line for future expenditures next slide just to show some of the statistics on your full-time staffing you can see you are at seventeen 35 five years ago and

you did drop down seventeen 35 five years ago and you did drop down to 14400 last year before last and this past year you were at 15159 and the average revenue per full-time student cost was at two 146 compared to 140 one 961 five years ago so again just showing complete growth and again i will not go

all these this is more of a take-home but if you look at the chart at the bottom of this it could show you what i see out of this if you would is the students portion of the revenues coming in is that little blue line and the state is the orange line above so the student cost of

the operating revenue at 32 million where the federal government and the other agencies provide 194 million compared to 170 million for years five years ago so again giving everybody a snapshot of how the public is supporting and the students do not have to cover so much of their cost and finally on the expenditure side again not to

go into all these details more for your viewing but looking at the bottom line your total operating expenses at 182 this year compared to 195 years ago and compared to 173 just last year and again if you look at our instructional cost oh we are finally itching back up it was at 66 million five years ago when

we had more students and we dropped down to 60 million two years past and just jumped up to 63 so as students are coming back we are increasing some of coming back we are increasing some of that cost and the last couple of slides are just to show the faculty and then the staff administration and the bottom

chart is showing the combination of the two and again as you could see in years past where we had so significantly more staff and faculties i think visually this covers it better and that is my story and i will say i will stick to it you all have done a fantastic job cons congratulations on continuously getting the

certificate of achievement year after year and the financial accounting standards of being closely followed like to thank the administration your staff just does a fantastic job across the board and again it always comes down from good guidance from the board how many how many years does this make that you have done our auditing i know over twenty

and i tried to get to the exact number but i could not find i have been here 30 i think you have been here the same time so maybe it is been over 30 sir i have one question appreciate it i appreciate your work and mr flores i appreciate your staff in 21 on page fifteen you show
