the laughter and your friendship the laughter and your unwavering support to our sweet son mikampion being a boy mom is one of the greatest joys of my life he is full of kindness silliness and a pure heart just the right blend of joy and goofiness that keeps me grounded and reminds me not to take life too seriously

he helps others he lifts spirits and he shows me what happiness looks like in motion he is my daily reminder of why this work matters and the kind of future we are building one full compa one of full of compassion curiosity and love now i come from a single mother household raised by a woman who gave everything

she instilled in me the unshakable belief that education opens doors not for recognition but to serve to grow and to give without expecting anything in return one of the poems that shaped me deeply growing up was la mama's mala mundo the worst meanest mom in the world as a child i did not understand it i only saw

tough love and the many nos but now i realize it was about strength sacrifice and love in its most powerful form to my mom thank you for being lam mama's mala mundo you taught me what it means to lead with heart and with purpose to my sister and rko my extended family you have surrounded me with love

encouragement through every step and your belief in me means more than words can say and to my lifelong friends thank you for being here thank you for being the ones that i can always count on to show up to cheer to remind me of who i am and again for being here today and to a dear friend

and now i bring the same heart to this board and for me this role is not a title it is an extension of my calling to teach to guide and to empower others through education i deeply believe in dr sarata's vision for el paso community college his leadership has rooted in access equity and excellence and i am

honored to join this board made up of our trustees who have given so much not only for their knowledge but for the heart and i look forward to learning from you and contributing alongside you lifelong learning does not stop at a degree it happens every day in our homes in our workplaces and in our lives and i

we are back on yes ma'am section one seven presentations by individuals groups and organizations individuals groups and organizations item one seven one mr daniel graves partner advisory of weaver and tidwell llp will present the results of the risk good evening good evening thank you i do have a brief presentation i will try and keep it brief i

know you guys have a lot tonight but i do want to present to you our risk assessment process it covers quite a few things so i will do a quick introduction talk about our approach the purpose of the risk assessment what we did through our planning stages and then ultimately resulting in our proposed four-year plan that i'd

like to present to you so in our introduction here i just wanted to there is a lot on this slide i know you probably have it in your material so i am not going to read it all but the risk assessment was a facilitated risk assessment and that is really the point of this slide we did not

come in as a third party to the college and say we know what your risks are we are going to assess it we actually had a independent objective viewpoint where we facilitated this through key leadership in the college who participated in the risk assessment and so wanted you to know that this is not just ours but this

is our way to facilitate your own internal risk assessment and then we helped validate that and then develop the internal audit plan from that so the purpose of the whole risk assessment process really ultimately is to look at inherent risks of the college and develop a internal audit plan and so this is a snapshot of what risk

is when we did the risk assessment so for this fiscal year we looked at a the inherent risk we will talk more about that later we took a multi-year approach into the overall internal audit plan we factored in college time and resources and really looked at the most influential risks that are here and present at the college

through all the significant activities that take place just because you exist and choose to pursue some of the things you pursue as an organization so the risk assessment in this graphic is really what is included is in the box in this one graphic so we started with in this one graphic so we started with risk identification conducted

the risk assessment then we use the in developed the internal audit plan the last piece of that is part of the internal audit function which is the ultimate monitoring which we would do once the plan's approved the risk is we are looking at is any event that has a potential to negatively impact the achievement of the college's

objectives and so when we talk about those we talk about inherent versus residual risk and so this is a concept we talked a lot about when we did our risk assessment meeting it is a little bit foreign to most people but it is a common way for an internal audit practice to assess risk so inherent risk is

really the risk in an uncontrolled state versus residual risk which considers internal controls and so what you see in the risk assessment there is several things in the red in the high but that is because it is an inherent risk assessment not residual and so one easy way to think about it is when we are talking through

the risk assessment we were talking with the president and the cabinet members and we said you know they said well this is low risk because we have policies and procedures and we do monitoring and i said well you do policies and have procedures and perform monitoring because you have a higher inherent risk what you are talking about

is residual risk and so that is something that i just wanted you to keep in mind from an internal audit perspective we base the plan on inherent risk we then perform internal audit procedures to validate and provide assurance that the confidence you have in the residual risk is accurate so that we confirm all the controls the policies

procedures that they are operating effectively so that you can have confidence then in your residual risk because it is a facilitated risk assessment you will see here these are all the members who participated in the risk assessment these individuals assisted us in providing insight into the influential risk categories what risks we considered as part of the risk

assessment the all the significant activities that we put together they participated in the forum where we performed the risk rating then there was some assistance and interpretation of some of the risk assessment results and we when we talked about the internal audit plan we got some background on college monitoring activities and so the risks that we included

again there is a lot on this page but we broke them down we had about weaver has a bank of about seventeen different risk categories and you will see many of them listed here we combined several of them to come up with five key risk groups starting with financial economic and fraud risk so those were three different

categories that we combined and defined as one risk group operations compliance and human capital so this has a lot to do with scalable processes and having the right people in the right places to do those activities student experience is the next so that is really your customer service what are we doing you know the this is one

of the big ones right because that is what we are here for is to give the students the educational experience that they need the next is risk sorry information technology risk so that has a whole lot in it that is cyber security that is basic blocking and tackling of also information technology functions that is support dependence on

it and then finally we have reputation and strategic risk and so that is your headline risk and so that is your headline risk what are we worried about hitting on you know the newspaper front page and then are we effective strategically so those were the five main risk categories that we included and we assessed these five categories

through the significant activities and so we looked at the basic internal basic activities that any organization has such as purchasing human resources basic it financial reporting some and payroll those are the five basic that almost any organization has but then we looked at all the different activities all the different programs and all the different things that a

community college has to do because they exist and because they undertake some of the goals and missions that they do and we defined all of those with the risk assessment leadership team we broke those out into major categories and then further defined each one of and then further defined each one of those in into subcategories below the

major categories and so we ended up with 54 major categories and so we assess those five risk categories across all 54 of these significant activities and below each one of these 54 we further defined are we then conducted a risk assessment forum where we looked at the probability and impact of those five risk categories across those 54

different significant across those 54 different significant activities once that was done we went back we did some basic math and then looked at some of the ratings and really assessed them from a qualitative standpoint we made some adjustments we consulted with management in making those and then that resulted in what we have is a risk assessment a

risk rated internal audit universe which is just a really internal audit auditor way of saying you know we finished with it and this is what it looks like and so this is your risk rated practice from high to low for the top 37 and you will see it is on a one to four scale one being low

four being high again we have you know almost twenty that are red and high but this is an inherent risk basis not a residual risk basis i just want to remind everyone of that because this is really how we are going to now this is what we now use to plan for our internal audits the long-term internal

audit practice and we have got another you know kind of pretty way to display it these numbers here correspond to the 54 listed that you already have seen the internal audit plan we looked at it from a lot of different ways we really in doing that we considered the risk ratings what was high what was low any

emerging risks or risks that have recently changed we wanted to look at those as those creep up also we looked at the timing audit timing of the audits in a multi-year approach anytime we do audits we want to make sure that we are not overloading any one area of the college with repeated audits year after year because

we also have follow-up procedures and so any mature internal audit function once you perform an audit you follow up on it the next year to make sure that those items have been resolved and so we have included that as well we put together a four-year plan that you can see from a strategic timeline those audits are structured

so that they build on one another from year to year it also considers the time that the audit that the departments within the college would need to respond to audit requests as well as remediate findings and so when in this plan i am we are only asking for you to approve year one and the reason we ask

for that we present all four years because we want you to see the structured layered and methodical approach that we have put together but we will reassess and refresh the risk assessment in a much lighter way than we did this year we will do that every year and reassess the internal audit plan and say does this make

sense for where we are at today and so what you saw was a snapshot of fiscal year 2025 we will refresh that every year and you will see it again for 26 27 and so on so in doing that we are recommending that we perform an internal audit over financial aid and you will see in the planned

summary procedures that will include everything from institutional financial aid the student success endowment scholarships state and federal veterans affairs pel requirements local tuition waiverss discounts those are all areas that will be considered when we scope that we also have included in here an institutional effectiveness and institutional effectiveness and reporting advisory engagement an advisory audit and so there

is a little bit different between an internal audit and an advisory audit an advisory is more consultative in nature the institute of internal audit standards allow for internal auditors to work in a consultative capacity and what we plan and what we have discussed with management here and they have asked us to include this is really doing some

advising and consulting around the hba reporting and data collection we have done this at a couple other community colleges in texas and it is been a very good success for those clients and so that is really where this is centered and what we intend to spend that time on is really around the hba reporting with some of

the newer u changes that are occurring through this legisl legislative session we have that is what we would cover here we will also perform follow-ups on the sb17 compliance audit that we performed just to see the few areas that we had recommendations on were addressed and then we have just as part of the other plan we have

basic project management a risk assessment update internal audit plan and then there is an annual internal audit report that we will also file you will see that later again this year because we will complete one for this year the texas internal audit act has an annual reporting requirement that is a summary report of all the activity the

guidance for that comes out in august and so we have included that on all the successive plans so that is our proposed plan for fiscal 26 for 27 we are recommending an information technology services audit we have u if you look back and i am not going to flip to give everybody whiplash on the slides but information

technology services was our number one risk rated activity and information security was number two so we are recommending information technology in our second year of our internal audit plan one to give them a year's notice of this is coming in 27 so that we can be prepared when we do this there is a lot in this and

we are recommending it before information security because this is the basic blocking and tackling and the core backbone of the central nervous system of the college's communication system but it is also a basic building block for information security this will have a few light security items in it you will see in here things like user provisioning some

b some basic security but there will be a much deeper security audit is what we have recommended in year four this also includes follow-ups and the regular annual requirements of the audit report from the risk assessment refresh 28 we have proposed safety and security again we have not proposed that we do information technology and then information security

backtoback because of remediation and planned follow-up so we will have we would expect that there would be follow-up in 2028 and so it would be a lighter touch for the it department where we would look at safety and security across the college you can see all the areas that would be potentially included in that and then as

in the final year for our four-year plan we have recommended information security again with all the other annual requirements and so from a four-year approach it really looks at financial aid hb8 reporting information technology safety security and then information security but again we are only asking for the fiscal year 2026 plan to be approved because we will

refresh this and represent the multi-year next year as would you remind me again what hda stands for house bill eight house bill house bill eight and that was the house bill and dr sarata you may want to sure yeah mr no i just did not understand what the yeah house got it house bill eight house bill eight

approved in the 2023 session okay now it looks to me that when you put this risk assessment you took the areas and functions and you sliced and diced and you came up and rated everything one to four okay particip was this an individual aggregation without consultation was it a group meeting did they all get together and would

do this or did you know when you go back to what yeah okay did did the participants then individually rate this so everybody rated their own one to four rating and then this is the average or once how did that work or did you all together and agree or vote agree discuss that is a great question so

we did not average what we did is we gave them a packet and we gave the risk assessment team homework so your auditor gave everybody homework which is really fun to do in a educational environment and we asked them to go through their areas and rank them themselves one to four we gave them a set of instructions

then we all met we all sat in a room for i think almost five hours and went through this together and arrived at a consensus and so we did not average because if one person chooses one and one person chooses four it averages out and you do not really get a true waiting so we actually had very

active discussion over these different probability and impact ratings that were given and arrived at a consensus with that risk assessment team again it was we facilitated that discussion they arrived at these ratings and then we helped you know vet them out and see say do that does that really make sense based on what we know and what

we have seen at other institutions so each participant came up with the number one to four yes sir and then you took what all the participants and then averaged them is that how that work no there you come up with three 81 how'd you get three 81 one if well there was no act so the five major

columns so everything under financial economic and fraud we have a probability rating of four and an impact rating of four for the first one so we went and we gave all of those then the probability subtotal and the impact subtotal those are averages of all the other scores put together so that is where the averaging comes in

yes sir that is where the mathematics comes in but the group but the group then agreed that yeah as a group that it this is this area is a four correct okay and so it was it was a group consensus yes sir okay now who is the group was that the the staff the members that you identified

on that slide yes sir okay this group here yes sir so we made sure that we had representation from all areas of the representation from all areas of the college and tried to have a really a broad holistic look of everyone who could holistic look of everyone who could participate so again we did not we did not

come in and say we know what your risks are here's your risk ratings we said this is this is the concept of risk rating this is the concept of the risk assessment we led that facilitated it and then honestly when there were ratings that were given that i did not think made sense it is our job to

play devil's advocate and ask questions and that is what facilitated the discussion to arrive at the consensus scores so okay individual okay i understand and sir i have a question or several who when you address the audits who does the timely audits is that your job or is that the job of the cabinet the can you ask

that in a different way yes you said that there will be ongoing audits yes every year one year next year next year and who is responsible for those audits is that something we are hired you all to do or is that something the college leaders yes that was in the request for proposal we proposed on that to

be the internal auditor i believe it is a five-year contract or one year plus multiple renewals and so yes that would be us performing those audits and is there an advantage to say for example the college going for the because we approve one year at a time right is there an advantage to approve all the years together

you could do that but the reason we recommend to not do that is because the risk profile may change from year to year and therefore you may want to change the plan from year to year so we only ask for one year at a time it is not because you are going to increase the price the next

year no that our contract's locked in we have an annual budget that we stay within and so those are the audits that we think we could do inside that and we will scope and structure them so that we can make sure and stay on budget and how long did it take you to put this all together more

or less i do not have the amount of time but it usually takes us between 80 to 100 hours to facilitate this from start to finish and in subsequent years it is much less we usually do it in less than twenty because it is a refresh and it is not a wholesale refresh of the risk assessment so

all the subsequent years as we relook at it and refresh it we can usually do that in under twenty we can usually do that in under twenty hours and with safety and security being proposed for maybe 2028 i believe that is the year is that because there is a lower risk so does that mean that everything's pretty

safe that we focus in safety and security was number five on the risk rated universe but on the auditing it does not it go to but on the auditing it does not it go to 2028 we will not audit it until 2028 again this is an inherent risk so i cannot tell you that you i haven't gone

in and audited so i cannot tell you that you have a safe environment we looked at it from an inherent basis so then we would go in once we do the audit then i can tell you if you have if your controls and your procedures are operating as intended and that is the way this is structured so

we start with an inherent basis not including or thinking about controls so that then we can give you assurance that of what your environment looks like if you have internal control gaps or internal controls that are not operating as you expect them to be okay thank you and dr sarata the question i have for you is will

we be getting a copy of this report yes dr graham so we will and then after every audit mr graves will come and present to the board the results of that respective audit he'll provide a synopsis to the cabinet as well but then it ultimately comes to the board for approval just because it is a lot of

information to digest it all at once totally understand yes we will make sure item one seven two dr william sarata college president will recognize individuals college judge hagerty and members of the board always a bittersweet moment while we are happy for our employees that have reached retirement it is always bittersweet for us i am going to acknowledge

to approve record any discussion i have a question what is this for dr judge hagerty so maybe for the edification of some of our newer board members as well we run the small business development center here in el paso as part of our cooperative agreement to through ut san antonio it is funded by a mix of institutional

dollars as well as grant funding dollars from ut san antonio so their fiscal year does not line up necessarily with our fiscal year and so what you will see every year is a smaller allocation to get us through operating through december we expect another allocation a larger allocation before december to extend us through the rest of the

academic year but if you look at the number of clients served etc on this grant or this board abstract you see that we have a pretty significant impact on the local economy through our small business development center present in the audience is audrey maruo our current director of that so thank you for your efforts there very impressive

i do not get it why san antonio they are just the funer of the large grant that passes through to the other small business development centers so they do the whole state just is it the state give the money to san antonio i want to say it is national but i will defer to ap primich if he

knows if that is just through the state or if that is national i do not get it does the state give it to them and then they disperse it correct yeah they must have a senator or somebody on the board here so actually the state is divided into four main districts and every district has a lead institution

that receives the grant so it is funded through the small business administration and then to the districts and so utsa covers everything from austin south and west and then the other large district is the area around dallas fort worth and then the panhandle and far east texas make up the other two okay thank you any other discussion
