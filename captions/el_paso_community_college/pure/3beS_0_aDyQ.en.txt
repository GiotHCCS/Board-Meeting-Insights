disabilities and remained there for eighteen years working at the csd was rewarding for her because she was able to meet many students who had more than one disability and they had major challenges throughout their academic years as a csd staff member miss garcia was able to apply herself by learning how to do every task required by the

department not only did she interpret in the classroom she also tutored math english reading and other subjects to the deaf students of the college working at the csd made her become humbler and more grounded by seeing the students potential to succeed because of their can do attitude because of these students she was able to continue her education

the college and she was hired as a tenure track full-time instructor for the sign language program she is always been an active participant in the discipline creating ideas for the students to learn american sign language asl she says that her element is in the classroom and that her that in that place she is in a different dimension

providing instructional activities for students after 35 years of service miss garcia will be retiring on the 31st of this month there were many reasons for her to decide that it was time to retire but the most important was to take care of her health it was a difficult decision but she has other goals in mind one of

her plans is to volunteer for hospice and be there for deaf people and their families she also wants to be there for the hearing impaired who have no family her passion and the calling gets stronger as each day passes mrs garcia shared that she has been fortunate to work at epcc the college and personnel have been good

there thank you so much thank you section one eight communications item one eight one eight one discussion and review regarding data statistics policies and general information related to el paso community college by the board of trustees chair hagerty and members of the board i'd ask dean tony badio our dean of dual credit early college high school to

approach the podium to be present to the board our incredible progress with our dual credit early college high school and pek programs all under the direction of dean bado and her colleagues dean bio please thank you dr sarata good afternoon jay hirely members of the board i love this presentation by the way i do not know if

you have noticed but i love what i do and i want to acknowledge that i may be the face of dual credit early college but this is a team effort my fellow leans coordinators there is a number of committees so thank you thank you so first a little bit about the students that we serve the high school

students that we serve as you well know we serve high school students in public private and public charter schools we offer college courses for dual credit to them we also have homeschool students who take dual credit with us in fact i was just looking at data today and we have a twenty increase from last year so we

have more and more homeschool students coming to campus as you know we also have early college high schools and pathways in technologies early college high schools or peks in addition we have some early college programs offered to dual credit students for them to earn a post-secary credential at any point if you have any questions please let me

know i'd like to give you kind of like a perspective right twenty years so back in 2004 a very small percentage four of our student population was high school student population was high school students ten years later right we already had we already had early college high schools but still dual credit was still a significant portion of

our high school students today or last fall 36 of our enrollment was high school students with early college high schools of course taking over the lead and now we can see also pek students this last i have to move because now i have flowers right in front of me so this spring 39 44 of our stu of

our student population was high school students again we are very quickly right approaching that 40 mark dr can attest that colleagues across the state other community colleges have 50 high school enrollment in some so again approaching the 40 mark but something that i wanted to point out is that our students are incredibly successful high school students are

very successful they complete their course completion is 87 compared to 72 of non- high school students and mr flores tells me that 71 are academically educationally disadvantaged and that is as he has mentioned in the budget workshops right our funding now also that impacts our state now also that impacts our state funding so definitely dual credit great

indicator of student success so some of the things that we notice right in looking at the data not only with us here at epcc but with our partners at utep is that students have higher gpa do students who take college courses in dual credit their graduation rate at epcc the third three-year graduation rate is twice as high

than non- high school students and our friends from utep tell us that the four-year graduation rate is three times higher if students had taken dual credit in high school so again great indicator of student sessions and of course great savings for the students and their families paso community college waves tuition and fees and our partners provide textbooks

and materials for them 62 of our early college and high high school and pek students have earned a post-secary credential we are approaching the eight zero mark historically right to date and even our non early college and pek students have earned post-secary credentials 436 so far and we are going to see an increase because my fellow deans

have been working really hard at creating more level one certificates that our partners are very interested in not necessarily under early college and ptech but even for our traditional let us say dual credit our traditional let us say dual credit students all right a little bit about what we do to stay in touch with our partners if

you remember dr used to report on the different events that we had throughout the year but i figure maybe just once a year is enough for you to know all of the things that we do to collaborate with our partners so definitely we have a number of workshops during faculty development we have two specific for our high

school partners we have we host a half a day in june we call it the dual credit summer convening and that is for newly credential dual credit faculty just to get them ready to deliver a courses at the high school and we also have the dual credit forum typically in the spring again an opportunity to bring our

partners opportunity to bring our partners together we also have something that we have been calling the counseling institute our counselors and adviserss and you see some of them there in that picture they put together an agenda and invite all of the high school counselors for all the high schools in the region and some high school administrators and

district administrators join them as well and this is an opportunity to give information to brand new counselors and also to update some who are more seasoned again we have this fall and seasoned again we have this fall and spring this october 24th we are going to hold the 12th annual building bridges dual credit conference again we bring

all of our partners for the region ut texas tech region nineteen again we have multiple breakout sessions for this conference and finally we have the early college high school leadership council we have a partnership with eight school districts for early colleges and pex so we hold these meetings twice a year this one is mostly for leadership at

the district the high schools and of course epcc so we are busy we are always having something there is always something for something there is always something for everyone now let me focus on early college and pex and as you know these schools are designated by the tea and they have to meet certain requirements right they are

evaluated based on their access achievement and attainment outcomebased measures when i created this slide we hadn't heard from ta but we just heard from ta about their designations so i can share some of it some of it is confidential but i can tell you that ten of our schools were designated with distinction which is they went above

and beyond the metrics that tea establishes for designation so very and now i tried to change graphics because i want to keep you interested so this time i am grouping all the early colleges first in chronological order based on when the school was open so of course we always start with mission early college our first early college

high school opened in 2006 we now have close to one 500 in 2006 we now have close to one 500 graduates verda early college high school that opened the next year getting close to a thousand awards northwest early college high school with canot isd again almost 775 graduates i can tell you that these three early colleges were

designated with distinction very proud of them we also have trans mountain early college high school that opened in 2008 cotton valley early college opened in 2010 clint early college academy that opened in 2012 and you can see there how many awards they have received since they opened and burgess early college high school at first school within a

credit that is made up of faculty and staff we have of course our dual credit and early college high school counselors and advisors and we are very glad that particular team has grown in recent years to give better service to our high school students we have numerous dual credit instructional coordinators throughout the five campuses we have of

course our office of institutional accredititation to make sure that the college as a whole maintains accreditation with all of these off-campus sites and of course the many counselors and librarians at epcc that counselors and librarians at epcc that assist if you have any questions i'd be happy to answer them no question i just want to give you

some kudos for being an incredible leader of the program i know firsthand that you are always available or you make yourself available to all these campuses that need any sort of support or assistance so i want to thank you for your leadership and to all the dual credit team thank you great job all right thank you very

great job all right thank you very much section one nine board of trustees business items one nine one and one nine three will be discussed after executive session item one nine two discussion and action regarding a potential initiative to create a veterans museum in the el paso veterans museum in the el paso community mr chair go ahead

so i wanted to share with you as me many of you know that the el paso area is recognized as the veterans capital of the usa and that is throughout the county and we claim to celebrate veterans every day in this community we are proud of the rich military history of our local heroes so in our unyielding

commitment to veterans who serve in all branches of the military in time of war and peace a group of us mostly they are veterans and a lot of them are veterans from the vietnam era we are on a mission to establish a local shrine to honor the veterans memories and the sacrifices that they made throughout along the

along with their families throughout the wars that they have served under so it is our vision to find a building that we would be able to showcase and share information to preserve and promote the heritage of their military accomplishments we anticipate that their stories will have multiple angles of impact that will touch audiences young and old and

at the same time contribute to the historical knowledge of el paso county and highlight the contributions of those who served so with that in this effort we are planning to secure resources and to try and find a place we do not quite have that figured out where but we are looking at possibly having a one of those

modular buildings and we are thinking of possibly looking at epcc if it could be possible over there on in your area next to the monuments that we already have there for our military so this is a consideration and we are exploring that possibility so i just wanted to share with you that information so hopefully it is going

to become a reality and a reality soon because we are losing a lot of our u our especially our vietnam heroes that they are getting a little bit up in age getting a little bit up in age yep chair as a veteran i fully endorse that what i would like to see including in the planning i noticed

this last week that if you drive downtown next to the county courthouse across the street there is a plaque that honors all those people all plaque that honors all those people all those veterans that died in vietnam i know that we have other monuments around here i would like to see or i would here i would like

to see or i would suggest that we include in this operation a recognition of those other monuments and recognitions of those soldiers before that we have another one that there is honors the buffalo soldiers out as you enter fort bliss but when we do this let let us recognize all the veterans okay and so but it is

an outstanding monument across from the county courthouse and i wish i knew one some of the others but i'd ask that you include all a name of all the veterans please i have been surprised at the names that have come up from some of the committee members that are doing the research and it is very interesting and

we have you know medal of honor recipients and some of the people that some of us did not even know that and the contribution specifically i think was honored then as you mentioned that sergeant ray benites ray benovitz yes well i do not know how many of you have visited the site but right now they are just

finishing up the persian golf all the veterans that serve in persian golf memorial the site is mostly all done by donations from veteran associations all across the country and i do not think the college has ever turned down a request but i am sure as long as they come with a plans that fit our i just do

not think we need to put any funds from the college most of the veterans put bring up most of the money through raffles and i know there is a few bricks out there with hagert's names on them that we have paid several hundred for so i know there is all kinds of things that they do for raising

funds as a as a veteran i think that is the best idea i personally would not want an organizational support i would not want to see this individual dedication to the recognition yeah so i do not think there is a problem with we have there is a lot of room still out there at the site i do

not know how many people have visited it i recommend that you do it is beautiful that big old flag right up against the mountain right now especially when the mountain is so green after all this rain but i do not think we have a problem dr very much and one of the things that we are exploring is

there is a group that you apply for and they donate the building but we would have to do the foundation and then they would donate the building so we are exploring that possibility or if anybody in the audience has a building that you'd like to donate for this effort and we'd be more than happy to take it

i just think that it is you know the idea of having the having it right next to that the other monuments would be u you know would be great dr grammar is this just the purpose of a memorial a museum intended for a meeting space no it is not really for a meeting space it is more like

to showcase the different heroes that were from this community that serve from this community and have a lot of pictures of a lot of the servicemen and women and then a qr code so that we the vision is that we would even create it to where they could take students during field trips and teach them about the

different wars like have several rooms and each room represents one of the one of the different wars that they fought and and also some of the stories and artifacts we also learned last night at a meeting that apparently they are going to be closing down the museum in fort bliss so you know but these veterans are really

interesting they do not really want the museum or the inside for bliss they want it outside they think it is too encumbersome to try and go in there so there is a lot of very interesting discussions going on this but it is picking it is you know the momentum is really there now so we are going to

continue to pursue it and if you know anybody that is willing to donate a few million dollars we will take them few million dollars we will take them too yeah and if everybody remember back in the early 70s the el paso community college practically was all for the gis coming back from vietnam the gi bill paid all

their tuition so we have a strong relationship with the military and if you remember i do not know mr smith you might have been no you did not come till 1980 mr flores who is the oldest one not oldest oh remember that we we had our first classes out at fort bliss at the old training site they

leased it to us for a dollar a year so epcc started basically because we had a lot of veterans coming back from vietnam logan heights some of us went to logan heights well i did not want to date ourselves well i did not want to date ourselves dr well because you were busy fighting well because you were

busy fighting fires yeah how is this but we have a strong relationship with the veterans and i think it is a great idea so thanks for bringing that so i will give you a more formal report once we get because we had to create a board and we are looking to you know create a 501c3 formalize the

name of it because we could not agree on the name last night we had several names but i think each one of us said a different name so we never agreed on one but we will takes a little while to get them all on the same page so dr graham the item on the agenda says discussion action

regarding a potential initiative would the action be just that we would process the discussion i mean i mean continue the discussion further continue the discussion further just because at this time it was just presenting the idea of the possibility of having it in some of the epcc facility which would be out in the existing monument area in

flex across america so if the board is in agreement we will and again seriously if somebody was to offer a building or something cuz the commissioner had mentioned to me a long time ago that yes that the county had buildings but then when i pinned him down i did not quite get one so but if we can

come up with a building that would be ideal if not at least we would any other discussion so at the moment we would have no action then until we bring it up later is that then until we bring it up later is that okay i think the action would just be that the board would endorse the idea

of us working towards that together with no cost to the college of course if we are going to endorse i would propose the next time we discuss that we would have an overriding principle would have an overriding principle personally if you go to various monuments i think to say well we are going to have this we are

going to do that you know you split the focus and if this is the veterans and comes to mind the vietnam war monument in washington dc and the visiting in washington dc and the visiting monuments and there it is an individual personal thing and i you know the having a meeting hall is an interesting idea but i

think i think that you start dividing your focus if you do not i think the focus of the memorial is to recognize the individual and collected family sacrifices and we really do not need to have a place where we can have a meeting for something else because they have an available room i think it is the solenity

of the vietnam wall should be the primary focus recognition of be the primary focus recognition of sacrifice and that wall is already there many of us visited frequently yeah the wall that they have there at in the northeast is the wall just like in washington dc but it has all the names of the of the men and

women that died from the el paso county area and there all their names are on that wall when you go visit it really is a neat site if you haven't been there you need to go and i think it is on thursday when they have the food trucks and it is you know and it is a good

time to go and eat your dinner there and visit the monuments because they the women veterans are also very active nowadays they are coming up with all kinds of plans for that area as well the only thing i complain about is that it does not really have like and i wish we had some kind of recognition that

is facility of the el paso community college it does not say that anywhere and we should have some kind of big sign that says you know that thanks to the el paso community college all of those monuments are there dr s yes sir was any money left in the signage fund for building all these buildings we have

got around here i have not looked at that account in quite some time if there is not we could transfer resources to accommodate that and i am sure that we can look at suspended well i i am sure we could look at signage that indicates that this is as a result of the college's donation of resources or

donation of land that we have the flags across land that we have the flags across america because it really shows that the college is you know very supportive of our military community and the people that go there do not realize that is part of our part of the college when we have events sometimes i ask for the

microphone and i remind them but it should not have to be you may not you may not hear see it hear much but i guarantee you the veterans much but i guarantee you the veterans know we may not talk about it but we know any other discussion do we take no action no action no action no action

respond to any questions that the board may have any question thank you dr chair item one eleven consent docket there is none section two administration item two one bca bcb bce cg cgf cha d i a b e ecc ff db fbc tasby local policies for second reading and approval move to approve approval move to approve second

any discussion any discussion number one dr srada can or mr can we implement a policy of saying those letters as identified in the minutes rather than having her to go through all that number one i actually make that question i just deferred to mr rogan he said no i just deferred to mr rogan he said no problem

okay and second of all i do not know how many times we we have been through this but what we are doing is looking at an individual i wonder if dr pinley can give us the 30 zero foot view of where we are i mean if you look at the policy manual it is this big and each

one of those is a letter so you know where are we you know like a 30 zero foot view of where we are in policies and by the way just a real rough estimate of how much asset that is your time is spent on this dr penley please thank you mr exer in terms of the the short

answer is where are we with policies pending the approval of this action item we are caught up with tasby updates for the time being one of the advantages of the board's decision to convert our policies to the tasby system is we can be confident that we are now compliant with state and federal law and other statutes which

i am i personally could not have said in the past and you all remember that this was a bit of a heavy load it took about eighteen months for you all to go through that conversion process looking at your policies who went through it well you all approved the local policies i just want to emphasize that you

were the one that did it well it was it was a cabinet we went through each policy and made the recommendation where it would fit should it be deleted should it be kept in its current form it was it was a labor intensive eighteen months or so but we did it so at this point we are in

maintenance mode and most of our policies are not undergoing regular maintenance until we have a legislative session so i anticipate having a bit of a of a pause in policy updates until november december when tasby will be providing updates to many of these that came out of the legislative session to your point in terms of the size

or the effort you are absolutely right we have a whole shelf in our bookcases in my area devoted to the hard copies which were required to maintain dr sarata has a copy of all of the policies in his office and in terms of your final question about resources if i was essentially what we are doing is that

we paid you a bunch of money to sit there and read this stuff and then coordinate with the rest of however you do it but it is eighteen months a significant amount of time i guess is what you want to say for the initial conversion and at this point if i had to put a stopwatch on it

i would say each policy probably takes an hour and a half to two hours from start to finish then a real rough estimate of how many policies do we have if we have i would guess we have close to 200 right i ju i just think we just we look at it individually and i think we need

i just want to step back and say hey there is a bunch of stuff and it is changing all the time so where are we and i am good thank you dr penny you have done a wonderful job with a transition along with a team because it took a lot to move away from the oldfashioned style of

policy creation and archiving to what we have now it is good and dr graham is very happy and dr graham is very happy yes and then every legislative session will give us some new ones so we will keep you busy do we have a presidential policy that we have to get rid of two policies for do have

one policy that we will be presenting my hope is that we will be presenting to you and then that will be the final policy in the conversion but the policies are yours to do with your local policies are yours to do with as we had a second call a question mr uxer mr uxer i mrs robas mrs

robas i miss nahara miss nahara i dr graham dr graham i mrs moy mrs moy i mr mendes mr mendes hi mr hagerty mr hagerty i section three personnel item three one information items institutionally externally funded full-time staff and faculty appointments extensions resignations and retirements no action is required item three two tenure track faculty appointments and new

tenur faculty appointments and new tenur faculty move to approve move to approve do i have a second i have a second any discussion call the question mr uxer mr uxer i mrs robas mrs robas i miss naha miss naha hi dr graham dr graham hi mrs moy hi mr mendes mr mendes hi mr hagerty hi item three

one is no action required correct section four financial services item four one discussion and action on the approval of a one-year district-wide support agreement with oracle america move to approve four one and four move to approve four one and four yes second item four discussion and action on a one-year software maintenance support contract with illusian higher education

for the banner enterprise resource planning erp system in an amount not to any discussion any discussion yes i i'd know that i see oracle and i see banner and i know that they are related but i mean we got a million two between two contracts and how do these guys need each other i mean can you can

you tell us how do they mesh and why do we need both of them yes sir thank you for that question that is a great question so the short answer is that banner depends on the oracle database platform and while banner is the college's erp system that handles student records hr finance the data lives in the oracle

database and it depends on oracle and they work together obviously they need each other they work together technically but they are two separate companies and they require separate licensing and support okay is there any other organization that actually covers both areas both functions or are we really working is the industry such that they are segmented like that

unfortunately we have to buy them separately so we have to purchase the licensing from banner for the erp system and then from oracle for the licenses of the database and also i would like to take the opportunity to highlight also that in this agreement we are taking advantage of removing we are taking advantage of removing a module

that is no longer needed excuse me it is a web logic module that is no longer needed and also reducing the number of licenses that we have been using so we are making changes to the agreement and this in the period of three years we will potentially see a any other questions call the question mr uxer mr

uxer hi mrs robless mrs robless hi miss nahara miss nahara hi dr graham dr graham hi mrs moy mrs moy hi mr mendes mr mendes hi mr hagerty mr hagerty hi item four two discussion and action on the approval of a three-year contract with dell marketing lp for the purchase of desktop computers computer monitors and laptops for

district-wide use in an amount not to exceed 750 zero amount not to exceed 750 zero annually move to approve four two and four nine have some questions have some questions second item four nine discussion and action on the approval to purchase from dell marketing lp a storage area network sum in an any questions mrs yes i have

some questions on four two in the agenda we are saying we are estimating a significant number of desktop computers what is that significant number thank you for your question that is a really good question and the amount that we base it on is on previous purchases that have been done throughout the throughout the fiscal year and this

abstract that is in front of you for your approval is so that departments can buy computers when they are whenever they are needed this is not that for us that we are buying all the computers right now just a vehicle for them to use this approval to be able to purchase computers in the past years we we

average in terms of computers purchases it varies because sometimes we have done projects like last year we replaced over two zero desktop computers for the it computer labs and other labs across the district but for these that are just purchased by the departments it just varies every year and it also includes it allows us to also buy

the mobile the laptops as well okay just the as needed makes me a little bit nervous so do we have like a re refresh plan or a phase out plan or do you establish caps on each department of how much they are going to spend that is a great and excellent question and i am glad that you

asked that as well because we do have a mechanism to address some of the concerns that you have one of one of which is that we refurbished computers those that have been replaced by a new computer we take those other ones and we refurbish them and whenever anyone creates a work request to work on their computers one

of the things that we do is we assess the computer for their performance and the condition that it is in and if it is if it if it is recommended to be replaced we also offer that refurbished computer so that we they can have some savings and not do unneeded spending right because all of these actually are

the responsibility of every department budget head to assess and evaluate the need but they are also welcome to create a request for us to go and assess their computers to see if there is a need for it on top of that we also have another mechanism which is an approval process that we in coordination with the purchasing

department all technical or technology purchases required it approval so we review those requests and we only approve as needed not as once and on top of that we also i implemented a standardization of desktops and laptops so that it can help us with bulk pricing savings as well as u streamlining support and responding quicker and that was

my last question so thank and that was my last question so thank you so do i do i understand that as a computer tech if i am sitting there at the desk and all of a sudden i see in the local it magazine that the louis latest whippy dippy is out there and mine happens to be about

a year old i mean it is functional it is good but i really like the new stuff okay your procedure prevents me from should prevent me from then saying well this computer is no good i need a new one right now so the process that we have in place of standardizing computers will prohibit you from just customizing

a computer with the latest and greatest right so but that is not what i wanted but that is what we that is what we approve and that is why we have that process so we meet with the with the end user and we evaluate the needs that they have for their roles so for so we have a

different levels of specifications for their computers so depending on the role we specify a different computer for instance if they are doing engineering architecture or digital media then we have a different computer specification and packet that we offer to them and organizationally if i understand the or the organizational leadership the department chair has skin in the game

as to how often you replace what you have to replace so currently that is what we have and it is the responsibility of the department budget head to evaluate that so we do not have all of the purchases centralized through it but as i mentioned earlier all those other mechanisms helps us in ensuring that we do not

in ensuring that we do not overspend and one last question then on four nine how does the storage area network fit into all this so the storage error network is it is our storage that we have in our data center that is used for storage for different systems so we have applications that all the the storage that

data resides in there so it is centralized so that we can then expand it is modular and we can provision systems quicker as well because we also have our virtual servers and that are connected to our storage era network so that we can provide and that it helps us with reliability as well so that we can so

the contracts are for both of them are for dell marketing and so they know that they are on the line for both of them so we use that as an opportunity to get them to negotiate and i am glad you brought that up too because we do have a good relationship with dell and we are always requesting

negotiating i guess that is the word i was looking for we are always negotiating for discounts and in this case we always take this opportunity as well having that we given that we are going to have two different purchases with them they provide discounts for us dr strada for us dr strada sir one picky point if you

do not mind when we are preparing the agenda it' be neat if we had items four one four two four three marco and then we go to mr fernandez who has i have a question for when but you know rather than bounce around area concern around area concern understood any other discussion all the questions mr uxer mr

uxer i mrs robless mrs robless hi miss nahara miss nahara hi dr graham dr graham hi mrs moy mrs moy hi mr mendes mr mendes hi mr hagerty mr hagerty hi item four three discussion and action on the approval to award contracts to odp business solutions llc and el paso office products llc for the district-wide purchase of

office products in an amount not to exceed products in an amount not to exceed 650 zero 650 zero estimated annual aggregate amount move to approve second any discussion any discussion yes mr flores i presume out of all this when i see the word and you know 650 and the word aggregate makes what kind of monitoring program i

mean if it is aggregate and we sort of have it there you know how do we monitor make sure that i mean it does not it seems like it is not specified so we cannot track it so how do we know that you know that we have good managerial financial control over all of this if we are

if an aggregate so that the aggregate will say yes it is been used wisely good question mr ruxer we have significant internal controls built into our erp system so our method of budgeting line item budgeting for the supplies pool in this particular example will not allow a requisition to go through if the funds are not available it'll

it'll show a flag of non-sufficient funds which will cause the potential purchase to be questioned in addition to that our method of control for receiving goods and services for whatever the category is but in particular we do not allow for delivery of goods and services except for to college premises so nobody can divert purchases to their homes

or another location in this particular example supplies our method of budgeting as a good example for the instructional area we have five campuses so there are redundant budgets like we will have english department at a different location which will allow for closer scrutiny of budgets as opposed to aggregating all the supplies into one english budget we will

have a separate english budget for different programs we have about over 600 budgets which allow for closer scrutiny okay just now if we if we deliver to the different locations how can we you know once it comes to the campus then how do we what control we have when it brings in and you have fourteen boxes of

paper pencils and toner and it goes into some extra office there and then anybody can you know from personal anybody can you know from personal experience somebody i happen to know when they used to work as an engineer actually to work as an engineer actually accumulated bunches of extra pads of paper and other items so that they

become the central warehouse for their particular work location as opposed to the secretary keeping it i mean what kind of control do we have to make sure that everybody does not have four or five extra copies of whatever they have there well that re is dependent on the on the budget head the budget has to exercise control

for those resources within the department where the supplies go is very specific to the vendor to deliver to a very specific room and person so appropriate use is a managerial function yes sir yes sir interesting that is a big number to have spread out that is a big number to have spread out everywhere it is half a

million dollars just in my locker room your locker room fourteen in my locker room your locker room fourteen desks we have we have over 600 budgets separate budgets separate budgets okay any other questions other question other question mr be terrible if i started disagreeing with all this stuff would not it i mrs robless mrs robless hi miss

naha miss naha hi dr graham dr graham hi mrs moy mrs moy hi mr mendes mr mendes hi mr hagerty mr hagerty hi item four five discussion and action on the approval of contract awards for catering services for events districtwide in an amount not to exceed 300 zero estimate aggregate amount move to approve second move to approve

second any discussion call a question mr uxer mr uxer hi mrs robless mrs robless hi miss naha miss naha i dr graham dr graham i mrs moy mrs moy hi mr mendes mr mendes hi mr hagerty mr hagerty hi item four six discussion and action on the approval of a three-year support services contract with microsoft corporation for

enterprise support services in an amount not to exceed services in an amount not to exceed 178 966 move to approve four six and four seven move to approve four six and four seven second item four seven discussion and action on the approval to award a three-year contract to kasoft technology corp for a web-based software platform for planning

and accreditation forms in an amount not for a three-year period any discussion yes on four six it is microsoft which is essentially a software function and then we see fire print seven is a software are there any coordination is there any overlap is there any relationship between these two or they just need to be independent treated independently

separately will not you ask dr pinley to answer i am sorry i will go ahead and take this thank you for your question mr ruxer so they are two separate applications so the microsoft that you see here the abstract is for requests of support it is not necessarily the licences licenses those you approved last last month last

board meeting this is just for support so that we can get proactive support from them as well as prioritize support and it just helps us to maintain our systems and operational and it reduces also by having the support it augments our staff and so it allows us to have whenever there is a an issue that needs to

be re repaired or fixed for a faster response time to address that a faster response time to address that issue so they are really not even comparable type or operations and no sir they are two different things so things so okay any discussion call a question mr uxer mr uxer i mrs robless mrs robless i miss maher

miss maher hi dr graham dr graham hi mrs moy mrs moy i mr mendes mr mendes hi mr heaggerty mr heaggerty hi item four eight discussion and action on the approval to award a contract to american data bank llc a disa healthc care company for drug screenings motor vehicle record mvr checks background checks and compliance logging services

and install new elevators in buildings a b and c at the va campus in an move to approve move to approve second any discussion any discussion yes we talked about the elevators in a previous day and i think one of the things that we wanted to look at was what was the usage or the need established and

i think the agreement was there but we really did not know if it was more of a medical compl what is the compliance issue or if it was an actual issue what where do we stand on the certification and justification for those so with regards i will begin and i will ask mr footus to weigh in as

well with regards mr oxer to the need the need is absolutely there we have had unfortunately where the elevators are unfunctional we have had students as well as faculty and or staff that were not did not have the capacity to utilize the stairs whether it be an ada issue an injury what have you and so the need

is absolutely there with regards to increasing the capacity and providing additional elevators in those respective buildings i am pleased to say that initial estimates ran as high as eight five million for this renovation the elevators are that are in those buildings are the original elevators they are a system that is no longer supported by are no longer

utilized in construction so it is very difficult to fix the current elevators if and when they are out these would allow us to have additional elevators as support for those respective buildings again pleased to see that the that the bid that the board will go forward with for medlock commercial contractors came in just over five million it

is a one-year 360day construction time period which we anticipate will begin on the 1st of september so we feel very comfortable with the need the justification and the move forward on this a lot of kudos to ruben gallardo and mr flores on being able to move this forward their teams we first discussed the elevators a couple of

years ago so it is good to be at this point where we are moving forward with construction u but these buildings were built in the mid70s these buildings these are the original elevators that are in those respective buildings so no doubt on the justification and need for them mr flores please add to anything that i flores please

add to anything that i missed no dr s i thought that was quite a complete answer in addition to that we find that we sometimes we need them to move freight and so this plan will give us two elevators for building a b and c each so we will be able to segregate the freight part of moving

things to different levels and also we have had incidents where people have been trapped in those elevators because of age and ability to maintain them so th this is a very important need in any other discussion other questions mr her mr her i mrs robiss miss nahara miss nahara hi dr graham i mrs moy mrs moy i

mr mendes mr mendes hi mr hagerty mr hagerty i item five two discussion and action on the approval of expenditures with various vendors to purchase building materials supplies and or services as needed districtwide for fiscal year 2025 2026 move to approve move to approve second any discussion just a quick question this is just sort of an anticipated

usage it is already an existing planned to budgetary item i guess is that and so it is just it is now coming due that we need the stuff supplies is that it is it is okay it allows us mr drugs are to have these contracts in place in that if we have an emergency on a one of

our respective campus or a need to move forward with any repair with any contract that we are allowed to move that forward as opposed to waiting till the next board meeting as well to approve the contract which then we'd have to do the rfp at that point move forward wait the period of time it prevents the college

from delays and being able to move forward between the last board meeting and now we have dealt with water issues at the northwest campus we have dealt with a variety of issues at each of our respective campuses ac at the rio grand campus and the staff in particular the folks in the front have been dealing with those

respective issues and ensuring that the college can continue its functionality continue to serve the students that we are fortunate to have enrolled at the institution without having to come to the board meeting every single time now if it is an expenditure that is beyond any of these we still come back to the board but we but we

have already approved the general the general budget for this is just saying now it is time to spend it this is approving this correct this is approving the budget that is in that is in place for this coming fiscal year is in place for this coming fiscal year okay any other discussion call a question any other discussion

call a question bill mr ruxer mr ruxer hi mrs robiss mrs robiss i miss maher miss maher hi dr graham dr graham hi mrs moy hi mr mendes hi mr mendes hi mr hagerty mr hagerty hi section six curriculum and instruction item six one discussion and action on the approval of the restated and amended burgess early college

high school interlocal agreement move to approve move to approve second any discussion other questions mr ruxer mr ruxer i mrs robas mrs robas i miss maha miss maha hi dr graham dr graham hi mrs moy mrs moy hi mr mendes hi mr hagerty mr hagerty i item six two discussion and action on the approval of an amend

amendment to the court cooperation contract agreement from the texas higher education coordinating board in the amount of coordinating board in the amount of 33 390 33 390 move to approve move to approve second any discussion yes this i understand is mr smith president smith excuse me dr smith the there is an original contract at 300 zero and

this is 30 this is just to if i can read it correctly it is called the opportunity high school diploma program how many what is the student rate what is the participation rate i mean what do we expect or want or to have i mean so we are going to spend 33 zero but is anybody participating in

this or yeah so for a little context last year we were awarded a planning grant in the neighborhood of 100 zero so faculty have been working along with five total schools four other partners in the state to develop the program the competencies for the opportunity high school diploma program this year they are developing the curriculum so there

is no participation at this point we anticipate the first cohort to come in the spring and do you have a number we are hoping to get a cohort of twenty to 25 to start out 25 to start out okay it is not a one zero two zero no absolutely not and we think there is considerable growth potential

in our region there are a lot of individuals that have for whatever reason dropped out of high school are in the workforce now but would benefit from coming back completing their high school diploma and earning a college degree or diploma and earning a college degree or certificate how does this differ from a gte so the ged is

yeah is one avenue for someone to show completion of high school some folks do not have a ged or a high school diploma so the state felt that an opportunity to get a diploma might be better than a ged we also have ged programs at the also have ged programs at the institution okay and this is the

state found another pot of money so they have divided up that up amongst the five partners and our share is 33 zero and we will be using that predominantly to market the program but this is this is focused on getting a ticket puncher if you will out and so that it helps people get further their personal career

that is absolutely correct not only for their high school diploma but to earn a college credential at the same time y any other questions call a any other questions call a questionable mr uxer mr uxer hi mrs robless mrs robless hi miss naha miss naha hi dr graham dr graham hi mrs moy mrs moy hi mr mendes
