not think there is anybody that wants to talk to us so we will go right into number to us so we will go right into number five discussion the four is yours mr judge hagerty i' i'd just let the board know this is our usual of our board budget workshops that we be bring to the board annually

we knew we were not gonna we were not going to ask the board to entertain a tuition increase normally we would have br if we were going to entertain a tuition increase we would have come to the board in february for a tuition increase we did not anticipate needing to bring to the board a tuition increase we

have had a lot of moving parts the state just provided us their near i say in quotes near final run based on house bill eight and then some legislation that passed this session so i was able to provide the near final run for el paso community college to mr flores and his team over the weekend they have

been working on this presentation quite diligently and so we have got what we feel will be near final numbers for the budget this is the first budget workshop we will have another in the j in the july time frame and then we will have the final one in august have the final one in august before but sure

you do when you do that just give us your best guess of worst case best guess of worst case sure for what the state will do will do we will do but i want to thank mr floris and his team many of that are in the room miss miss uniga miss dees for all the good work that

they have done on this i want to thank the vice presidents for their work because we do have budget requests in here as well i will be working this is the first view that the board will see i will be working with the vice presidents to attempt to trim that they have trimmed a lot on their own

but we will continue to move forward i am happy to tell you that all of the budget scenarios are balanced budget they are all have a surplus within those so we are in a good financial position but with that i'd ask mr flores to brief the board of where we are thank you dr sarata chair hagerty secretary

graham members of the board of trustees president sarata my name is fernando flores i am the vice president of finance and administration i will be providing you an overview of the budget development process this afternoon i am joined by associate vice president anna suniga and she put together the revenue estimate projections as well as maintaining the four-year

model up update in addition we have miss laura deis who is our budget director and guides the process from february all the way to august she is in charge of coordinating the budget development process for us and does a great job for us in that respect before i get started with the powerpoint presentation i wanted to add

that the pres presentation today has very preliminary numbers in some respect that will be moving and getting updated through the summer and so these numbers will change as dr sarata said with excuse me and so also the goal of the budget development process is to produce a sustainable budget at the end of the period what we hope

to present for board approval in august will be a sustainable budget so this next slide shows the main items of the presentation we will cover today we will go over an overview of budget development process for fiscal year development process for fiscal year 2526 we will look at an overview of revenue sources for fiscal year 2425 and

projected revenues we will look at the 2425 adopted budget and projected expenditures and then these next two items will guide the budget development for next year we will look at an overview of fiscal year we will look at an overview of fiscal year 2526 projected revenues then we will look at the baseline budget this is based upon

the submission by all the executive level that is represented here on my right and then that will result in preliminary budget strategies that is more a compilation of the projected revenues expenditures and different scenarios for your consideration and then the 4-year financial model has been updated and then we will look at next steps for adoption of the

fisc year 2526 adoption of the fisc year 2526 budget i know that many of you have seen this slide before but there is a couple of newer board members as part of the team so i will review it again in february the budget workshops are presented by miss stis to district staff she holds two workshops per year

where they are updated on on the budget process if they have any questions any new managers are provided the opportunity to attend and she provides hands-on training people can log on to their budgets and banner and so she does a great job with that in february also the budget requests are completed by the executive level that is

represented here today march 7th is the deadline for their submission of budgets march through april the budget office compiles all of those submissions by the executive level and produces a baseline budget from their submissions we will be seeing the baseline budget in later slides april through may meetings are held with the vice presidents to review their respective

budgets to see if they have any questions anything that we can help them with on their budget development that is their opportunity to review what they are submitting and ask us any questions that we might help them with in the may time period we meet with dr sarata and present him the baseline budget based upon the executive

level submission and so we go over the revenue projections and talk about any budget strategies that we need to consider any salary enhancement options that might be supported by the projected revenues and we have those kinds of discussions after that in july we are going to review and approve additional funding requests that have been vetted by dr

set that has not happened yet so we were that is going to be our next step in the budget be our next step in the budget process and usually results in lower numbers i might add so in june through august we present workshops to the board as the as the numbers are firmed up and we get clarification

on any issues on funding that we are seeking and then results in august with the adoption of the budget by the board of adoption of the budget by the board of trustees this is overview of the budget development process a little bit higher level the process started in february as i mentioned we are going to look at

current year fiscal revenues which are the basis for revenue projections for next year so those are impacted by enrollment interest rates things that are happening at the state level where we base the projections on then we are going to look at the 2526 budget based on rollover of the current 2425 adopted budget and it is adjusted for

any salary savings from vacant positions and reallocation additional requests are submitted by the executive levels and are reviewed by the budget office and vetted for funding by the president that is a major step in budget development as well and then we will evaluate salary enhancement to remain competitive in hiring and retaining faculty and staff so these are

the some of the key timelines that are going to guide us in our process and as a reminder the board has to so for the current year this is what the revenues sources look like for the current year our budget is 166 four million and the revenue sources are comprised by the largest property tax property tax revenue

73 million almost 44 of the budget followed by state appropriations 44 one at 26 five of the budget tuition and fees 39 million 23 those are the three largest categories of revenue sources for the district in addition we have self-supporting programs estimated at three million other income largely comprised of interest income six three million and then we

have overhead recovery this is recoupment of the administrative cost related to grants and contracts grants and contracts allow for entities to charge an administrative fee it is called an overhead recovery fee and so that brings in revenue when we manage so these are the expenditures supporting the current budget that we are operating under and so the largest

category here is instruction 55 one million 33 of the budget followed by institutional support almost 51 million academic support twenty seven student services twelve million physical plan thirteen three million followed by public service over here three four research 214 zero the classification method here that we are required to follow is prescribed by nubu national association of college

and university business officers so this is the classifications that we have here also would let you know that this classification is the same one that you would see in our financial you would see in our financial statements bernie sir instructional support that is salary up to the in classroom level salary up to the in classroom level right

yes sir those that is all the yes sir those that is all the faculty and the faculty and then instructional support what is that covered so institutional support yeah institutional i am sorry that is the administrative that is administrative offices that is payroll accounts payable vp all the all the supporting purchasing all and then academic support academic

support is the labs the academic support is the labs the libraries okay counseling got it what is transfers what is transfers transfer transfers are certain amounts set aside to be set to certain funds that support other activities for example the transfers we do a transfer for texas public education grant of one million texas public education grant is

mandated by law from the state so that is a mandatory transfer that is one million in addition we transfer another one three million to the plant fund for ongoing projects and then we transfer to the athletics program sport athletics and then student activities and then we also we also we also do a small transfer to student government

so i will go into more detail on the slide so this same budget now is organized by expense category so in here what you see is the largest so in here what you see is the largest portion is going to the staff and faculty salaries so over here on the right you see faculty salaries budgeted at 56

eight million 34 of the budget and then over here you see staff salaries at 50 here you see staff salaries at 50 million three million three and then here you see benefits at fourteen two if you add those three categories that represents about 73 of the budget so that is probably the biggest takeaway from this particular slide

that most of the budget goes to staff and faculty salaries and benefits yes sir supplies and services is that where so we are going to pay a lot more for electricity you are going to put it in electricity you are going to put it in there so we talked about salaries and then we have contingency of six

seven at the top that contains a bianium reserve largely in it we talked about benefits supplies and services as mr xer says that does include utilities it maintenance software those kind of things we talked about transfers and then smaller amount to travel one three million and equipment one million in addition in the blocks underneath the salaries classification

you see a breakdown between full-time and part-time in those categories as and part-time in those categories as well so now we look at how we are doing in the current year in the current year what this slide does it compares the adopted budget right here in 2425 this is the budget we are operating under and then the

middle column what miss zuniga did is projected out what we are actually going to bring in and then we have a variance in a percentage compared to the adopted budget so as we can see on the state appropriations line item we have a variance of four seven million to the good up 107 that is that is because

of a dynamic adjustment the college received from the state we received additional funding because of performance outcomes that were reported can you please repeat that for the judge to hear i heard that wait till you hear how much we are going to get this year is that the 48 is the number you cannot your best yet i

mean you got last night is that it no this is the current year mr xer and so it is a dynamic formula now with house bill eight with the capacity of house bill eight and so they fund us based on projections when our actual outcomes came to fruition and we certified those with the coordinating board the funding

level was increased about four seven million based on our actual outcomes so that is all the fact so the projected revenue is higher than the adopted budget revenue than the adopted budget revenue ten 71 ten 71 the next item overhead recovery we are expecting a small decline we are adjusting that number as we do the budget development

that is the overhead recovery from grants and contracts so a very small decrease there under local funds the tuition and fees line item comparing the adopted revenue budget of 39 one compared to the projection of 42 five we have a positive variance of three four million on the tuition and fees that is because of the gradual increase

in because of the gradual increase in enrollment that is occurring incidentally we ran a report yesterday and summer is up twelve still holding at twelve up which is very good the fall at the moment very preliminarily is up as well so tuition and fees that has a positive variance of eight seven property tax revenue is projected to

be property tax revenue is projected to be 75 eight 75 eight million positive variance of two seven what happens on property tax revenue when we budget for that we budget very conservatively the tax office discounts the values by two eight certified values that they give the college are lower by two eight of what the valuations are so

the number that we book is a conservative number and that is provided to all the governmental entities in el paso the governmental entities in el paso the two eight two eight because they might have some lawsuits that are occurring re large refunds that may happen and they do not want it to hit the taxing the entities all

at once so it is a very good it is a very good thing that they do on our behalf so because of that practice where they certified lower values to us you can see the outcome that we are projecting we are going to bring in two seven more than we budgeted so that is the result of that

and then we have other income that has a positive variance of four million the other income the big item in there is interest income we budgeted very conservatively at five million for the year but our but our interest income is about nine million so far we have already we already almost doubled the budget but the reason we

do not budget that higher is because interest income is very volatile and so it is not a good item to build a sustainable budget item to build a sustainable budget on if you budget too high and the interest rates go in the tank then that is not a very sustainable budget so consequently we budget conservatively for interest

and this is a result of for interest and this is a result of that so when we look at that subtotal there we are we are looking at a positive variance of ten six million for the current year up to this point up through local funds and then we look at self-supporting projected revenues are going to be

one 584 that does not mean we are going to have a deficit this is only projected revenues in a while we will look at projected expenditures self-supporting accounts by definition break even the expenditures should not exceed revenues so on this revenue chart when you compare the budget of three million for self-supporting compared to the projection it is

a decrease of one four million all that means is that we did not have three million of self-supporting accounts active within the college so overall what you see here the takeaway from this slide is that we are projecting 180 we are projecting 180 million in projected revenue compared to the revenues projected in the adopted budget of 166

is an overall positive variance of thirteen eight million eight three and when do we close this august 31st august 31st so we got three months looking good almost fourteen million for three months next three fourteen million for three months next three months so you are going to see you are going to see the 180 million on the

next slide it is going to carry over to the budget status slide so i am we are fairly confident in 180 so this is the budget status slide this combines what we are projecting as revenue up here the 180 80 million from the previous slide we are projecting that and then so we did a projection on what

we think expenditures are going to come up to so we project expenditures at 145 seven expenditures at 145 seven million that is what we project out so that is going to result in a surplus of 34 five million as we project here as of the end of may now what you see here is we adopted a budget

revenues of 166 we have 180 million coming in so we exceeded the budget by thirteen eight million that is a part of why we have a surplus and then on the expense side we have we are under the expenditure budget by about twenty million those two together result in the surplus that we are projecting of 34 five

million and that will be used for fund balance to maintain a 25 ratio of fund balance to operating budget and then also for sax accredititation purposes they like to look at a healthy fund balance so these kind of results result in good reviews by sachs and also the rating agencies look at your performance how did you all

do how are you managing the budget how are how are you how are your numbers coming up how are your estimates holding up so surpluses are very beneficiary ultimately after we hit the 25 fund balance using some of this there is still going to be an amount left over that we are going to move to the project

reserve for capital projects those capital projects will address deferred maintenance and any capital projects for renovations anything related to buildings and grounds those kind of things and as usual like most entities we have more need than we have money so this is are there any questions on the slide could you go over the overhead i know that

variance i know that variance sure and how we reduce that or i know you mentioned contracts right here yes that overhead recovery and how we reduced that amount sure so when we are estimating what we are going to bring in on over recovery we look at all the all the contracts that the college has with federal agencies

state agencies local agencies some of those contracts allow for us to recoup administrative cost that is the called the overhead recovery rate so for example the national science foundation allows us to recoup fifteen of personnel and benefit cost in the contract so we estimate what that number is going to gen generate and that is overhead recovery for

that one example i have but some of the contracts allow for overhead recovery some of them do not one of the items of contention this year with the federal government is that they are proposing for the national science foundation that which was previously uncapped you could charge them your internal indirect cost recovery rate the colleg's indirect cost

recovery rate is 41 that is very nice so when you see an uncapped grant you say hey we are going to recoup 41 to pay ourselves back for having staff support that theirs is getting lowered to fifteen that is a result of what is happening in the federal world so far that is the only one on the

recovery that is being impacted so this decrease here this movie shows less activity that we are having in the grants okay thank you you are welcome are there any other questions on this are there any other questions on this slide i do yes sir do we carry vacancies at ten million a year so right now that is

the value of vacancies as of may that number is going to grow going to grow yeah that number is going to grow as people leave the college and we may not be recruiting or it is taking us a while to find somebody that contributes to that vacancy number so vacancies are the result of you know turnover and

so that number is the dollar value of the vacant positions that we have but it is also the vacancies that we have filled the year right some take years judge some are within this fiscal year some are within this last couple of months so it is a variety of all of those respective areas i have let the

vice presidents know that they have full control of their respective budgets if they have vacancies and they need to merge positions to create a higher level position they need to add resources to specific positions that they have full authority within their respective areas to use these vacancies in the way that they see fit they obviously bring those

to me and then i approve them but this is a little larger than our normal vacancy rate i want to say last year at this time we were probably in the seven to8 million range but we we are never staffed at range but we we are never staffed at 100 so if you look at the complete budget

it is 166 million and approximately 75 of the budget are salaries and benefits 121 million yeah so that is that is what you are looking at it is roughly a little less than ten is that is that normal for most colleges or to be at about 90 i only have a couple of college experience but i would

say that in the 90 to 93 is about the normal range for higher ed and for community for higher ed and for community colleges so moving ahead to the planning for next year's budget for 2526 the 89th legislature has met and so as a result of that they determine our near final run appropriation amount and so that

is based upon on performance measure outcomes and they talked about payment methods and refined this during the current bienium that has happened also the state house bill 500 increased the funding for community colleges by 89 five colleges by 89 five million that was because community college colleges outperformed the forecast that the coordinating board did so those two

things have happened the tuition and fees that we are going to project for next year are based upon the tuition rate schedule effective for this fall we have not raised tuition since fall of we have not raised tuition since fall of 2020 so that is still the same tuition rate and it is also based upon current year

and it is also based upon current year enrollment i mentioned to you that summer is trending higher but we are budgeting very conservatively at the enrollment for this year even if it is projecting higher we not until we see that number not until we see the dust settle do we budget the increased amount so we are budgeting

flat the current year's enrollment and there is property taxes based upon a preliminary taxable property valuation of 76 or 77 taxable property valuation of 76 or 77 billion and new property at one six billion and a preliminary no new revenue rate of and a preliminary no new revenue rate of 09839 cents per 100 valuation this is a

very cents per 100 valuation this is a very preliminary number these numbers will change the city sends us reports once a month this is going to change it is going the rate is going to go up and the valuation is going to go down people protest and those kind of things happen so that is going to reduce

the valuation and it is going to drive our rate a little bit higher typically that rate will change by about three or four percent it'll probably go over just a little over ten yeah ten one probably but still the nice trend for the college if you look at a 5-year trend in 2020 we were at fourteen cents

per 100 valuation we are capped at fifteen cents we are cap we are close to our cap so as a result of valuations continuing to go up that is driving our no new revenue rate down which is good because should the college need taxing capacity we would have it in case of an emergency like but we had

to hire like 40 faculty several years ago raised taxes in 1819 four to hire faculty we had we had the gunpowder to do that this creat creates a lot of capacity for the district yes sir we benefited last year by a tremendous increase in property valuations increase in property valuations correct yes sir okay what does it look

like for the next year does it look like we are going to hold property valuation same does it look like refunds will lower it are we looking for another big increase what is property valuation we meet we meet with the central physial district d kilgore and her team and we get updates on what is happening there is

a lot of building going on in el paso so that is that is projecting very well for property valuations to go up so we also have come to learn that over these past few years they have been re-evaluation years in other words traditionally the cad has not reevaluated residential property but once every three years now they are

every year so the best guess is the net value of the property will go up i mean all the activity up and funds and all the all the buildings yeah you think you think it'll go up like what maybe one i mean i know it is swipes we have been trending about adding about six billion per year

to the valuation almost ten close to ten close to ten yeah okay my home went up 41 so and i did not do anything to the so and i did not do anything to the house as my wife would tell you i feel you i feel you yes so last year our valuations were 68 billion now we

are at 75 the year prior to that we were at 61 billion the year prior to that we are at 55 so we are doing about 67 billion the last three years between eight and ten instruction now that we keep getting the same no new revenues so our essentially tax rate goes down right here that is correct

so the no new revenue rate adjusts and we are only entitled to receive the same amount of revenue we received last year but that does not take into account the new property and so as a result we see mr flores and his team normally budget for about a million more dollars in revenue from tax million more dollars

in revenue from tax annually but we have we have the option as a board as an institution that we could then change our own tax rate ourselves that is correct i mean up to eight yeah if you choose to increase it if you choose to lower it there is no percentage but if the board chooses to increase

our tax rate we can go up to eight without a election if you go beyond eight we have we are not precluded from we are not precluded from okay we are not that that is legislation was passed in the 2021 session that restricted school districts cities counties to they went from eight to four we worked hard at

the state level that community colleges were not included in that so our rate has remained at eight despite us only doing that twice in the last 25 so another factor so some of the other factors in the strategic planning for the budget development process there is going to be discussion consideration for a salary enhancement for employees and

then as we have mentioned earlier additional funding requests that have been submitted by the executive level that are going to be evaluated for consideration into the budget and then the last two bullets continued impact of gaz 68 and 75 on unrestricted net position so those are amounts are unpredictable to us so we get a hit of between

one and six million to our fund balance every year so we do not budget for that but as you saw by the budget surplus on the budget status slide previously that is absorbed into any surplus that the college might be realizing so there will be impact from the gazsbies we do not find that out till about october

when we are closing our books and then we come back and book it so we do not we do not know what that is that is we are dependent on the state giving us that information to book the last item there is another new gazsby 101 on compensated absences that we are going to have to implement this

year and so we expect an impact of about 200 zero for that and what is that cover so gazsby 101 is being changed gatsby 101 or gazsby uncompensated absences says that you have to book a liability on august 31st for everything that you owe in vacation and sickness so for many years we have been booking the so

for many years we have been booking the vacation balance that is owed to employees converting that to a dollar value and then we pay off ten of the sick leave balances that has a dollar value so we book a liability of about four three million and so whenever we book a liability as an offset to an expense

so we have been carrying that in our books now the so gatsby's come back and said not only do you have to book that but you have to project out what people are going to use in the coming year so we are going to have to we are going to have to go through hoops to estimate that

like a 10page report that tells you how to figure out miss zita how to figure out miss zita congratulations on that so that is going to result in more expense to us so about 200 zero we are expecting who is not the gatsby who comes up with all these new formulas so the governmental accounting standards board gatsby

mr colleagues mr colleagues is the standard set setting body is the standard set setting body yeah for governmental on the private sector it is fazby we are on the governmental side we are gazsby so if we do not comply with the pronouncements we could get an unmodified opinion in our annual financial report and so that would be

really bad for us our annual financial report is critical to getting pal funding governmental entities look at how our journal controls that i mean that is that has so much impact the financial report we do not have a choice in the gazbies mr hagerty we do not have a choice we have to comply with that oh i

know we have to comply but it seems like they come up with a new one every year like i said gi 68 and 75 impact us by und00 million right to our fund balance when those hit in 2016 so that money just sits there so that money just sits there boom do we get any interest on that

money we do we do okay great question each gazby like gaza has an identified each gazby like gaza has an identified target has a different focus these guys and how are we how many gases are we subject to now 75 they are up to 101 up to 101 how many of those are fully funded as far as

none of them result in increased liabilities they have a different area of focus they have some of them can be displayed how you show deferred outflows and inflows which will not have an impact it'll just mean this aggregating information and presenting it differently yeah but with regards to 68 and 75 we are fully funed on those we

did not used to be we are now as far as i mean actual financial exposure to what is required we are funded up to but not 101 we do not know what 101's impact is going to be but we are estimating at least currently that it would be a few currently that it would be a few hundred

zero hundred zero hundred zero 400 zero 400 zero 400 zero change we'd be able currently to cover that that is correct okay so those are those are the main considerations in the strategic planning for the coming budget development for the coming budget development process so we look at hb8 funding model as dr sarata said we got the

near final runs that sounds really not so final anyway we are budgeting that amount in the revenue projections for next year and as a review that is based upon fundable credentials of value fifteen semester credit hours of dual credit those are the big performance measure outcomes that we are measured by that result in our appropriation and then

on top of that if the students that help us with these outcomes if they are economically disadvantaged academically we get a little bump as well a small amount so it is a pretty complicated formula and then adult learners we get a little then adult learners we get a little bumper this is a funding model for next year

right and this is projected state funding and what we are projecting is that our projected revenue is 48a so in other words we are projecting a about a five million decrease in state decrease in state so we are not he'll touch on that shortly great question mr the piece of that is the fast funding so we are

going to talk about that a little bit would that be additive to the 43 that is correct that is correct okay so we are going to talk about the fast so we are going to talk about the fast so these are some major do we have to hire somebody separately just to keep track of the government the

full employment so these are some of the major rule changes that have occurred that impact our performance outcomes so these are the new rules now that are going to affect our funding they limited stack credentials to one award per type per student per year the new credentials value test for associate degree they have shortened the return on

investment period from ten years to five years and they have also said that they have to have a salary of said that they have to have a salary of 30 zero 30 zero if they meet that criteria we are going to get funding for it if they do not meet that criteria we will not get funding for

it so exempted from those from that criteria are education and from that criteria are education and healthcare degrees and programs that we might have and also another change is fundable transfer to private and independent colleges and universities formerly we only got credit they went to a public college or university now transfers to private institutions those are called

referred to as i cuts independent colleges and university independent colleges and university transfers then they also are maintaining the credit hour threshold for institutional credential leading to lensure or certification so those are the changes that have built been built into that appropriation that you saw earlier the 43 million those are these changes are already reflective into that

number what is a new credential i think i know the first second line oh the new what he is referencing is the current credentials but what we did is at the state level so i am gonna i am presenting to the board today on the legislature so i will give you a preview i am going to speak

to when we start when we worked on house bill eight with the coordinating board in the legislature we set a timeline of ten years and that within that 10-year period every single credential that the college produces is considered a credential of value so as we go into the 89th legislative session so we started that in 23 we

got the first funding for it in 23 we turn around and in 25 the legislature meets and the legislature determined that the community college sector was overheating and so they had to find ways that the dynamic system was not quite as dynamic so we went from a 10-year time frame to a fiveyear time frame in two years

so that is why not all of our credentials are considered credentials of value now because some of them take longer than five years for the student to see a return on their investment just one new a credential is like you are certified to be an hvac tech no but what the reference in that is that the new

not the new credential i was just wondering does that mean that you are getting paid for adding new cte you are getting paid for adding new cte programs we would we would but it he is not referencing credentials he is referencing the theoretic how credentials of value are measured credentials of value are measured okay some other changes

are changes in credentials of value to exclude certain associate degrees certain degrees are not considered credentials of value for funding purposes anymore this is a change if they do not meet the requirement on the fiveyear payback period and the 30 zero annual salary then we will not get funding for those credentials if they do not meet that

credentials if they do not meet that threshold the specific areas that are impacted we did an analysis of those six zip codes and we produced 450 approximately 450 degrees in the in those respective areas so we anticipated that would are these mostly stuff that would take longer than five years to it takes well because all of those

are intended to transfer those are degrees intended to transfer and so they really should not start the clock until after the student receives the balora degree but they are starting the clock as soon and that was a change from the prior year before that it was a 10year period but their logic was universities ten year and colleges

are given ten year colleges should be twoear should be half of the ten year so they are going to do that the state transition yeah we submit everything mr tremendous to the coordinating board so every year you know the coordinating board knows when a student first enrolled their first time in college student they turn around and measure

the student as they go forward so we submit all of our data to the coordinating board and then the coordinating board crunches that data and determines what they are not you know i have gone back and forth with commissioner roser as well as deputy commissioner troutman on some of the measures that they are looking at so as

we went forward they were saying well it is taking students five years to earn an associates degree and i am said i am looking at your data that you produce and it indicates that we are taking three seven years to produce an associates degree but that is full-time students and they are looking at everyone full-time and part-time

together the important thing is that they hire so at a very high level view of community colleges how they got funded this year so for the current year the one we are operating in now the state had awarded two billion and so because the community colleges and so because the community colleges outperformed the year there is a

supplemental funding that increased the funding for the current year to two 36 billion and then for next year the amount is going to increase to two four billion for the community college so as the funding is increasing the funding reflects all fy26 new laws and rules proposed at the by the coordinating board august special board meeting where

they will be approved they will this does not this funding does not include opportunity high school diplomas i think we are a site for that and third party credentials and any anticipated fiscal year 26 dynamic adjustment or fiscal year 25 setup settle means that what you performed compared to what they forecasted for you and then they will

settle off with you if they owe you anything that is okay now legislature ban every two years does this every two years or did you get to review it every years or did you get to review it every year every year every year okay every year and the coordinating board will make those adjustments and so then we

will see funding either go up based on outperforming or go down if it goes down it is not taken out immediately it is taken out in the october of the so this talks about how we received the funding from the state this week we are supposed to receive our last installment for appropriation for the current operating year

so we are supposed to receive 25 of the current year appropriation in september we are supposed to receive anything that they might owe us for the current year and so that is the fy25 foundation payment we are going to receive it in september if they owe us any additional money they are going to owe us a very

small amount of money that is still pending in on october 15th that is the first payment of next year's appropriation and they all just 50 of their appropriation in advance so that is the 50 in october fifteen fy26 foundation payment and then if there is any other fisc year 25 projected any other fisc year 25 projected settlement

that means that we continue to report information state and they compare it to what they projected for us any difference if they owe us money they will provide it to us on october fifteen so all of this you covered up to now all is how they slice and dice the 48 million at least this year yes sir

wow our two people so the last bullet is fiscal year 25 projected setup what is it it is the difference between 25 performance as dispersed compared to how we actually dispersed compared to how we actually perform that is called keep track our appropriation numbers and then we actually reporting and then they recalculate dollars and then there is

a difference that is called set up can also be negatives tact there is eighteen colleges that are that the runs just came out i had an advanced copy of it and that is why i provided it to mr flores but they literally just came out while we are in this meeting 34 minutes ago to all the presidents

in their areas and eighteen colleges are seeing a downward adjustment based on their outcomes the highest colin counties losing three one million lone star's losing just under three million big colleges small colleges or just across the board across the board but those two that i just mentioned are two of the largest in the state but for them

given their tax base that is no big deal right so what is important to note from those comments and the discussion on settleup is there is inherent risk in our projected revenues when we budget and we project revenues there is risk in our budget development we have to be conservative because things can turn and we have to

absorb any turn and we have to absorb any decreases but let us go back a little bit so those are the upcoming payments other changes that are happening so they are also accelerating there there is several reports that the college generates to the state that are required the report of fundable operating expenditures the rfoe normally that is

due at the end of january so laura is going to have to have that ready by the end of december so they are accelerating that by a month that is that sounds simple on the face but we have to have the audit done so we can do that so it is kind of a cascading thing we are

going to have to push everything back and organize ourselves to to meet those reporting deadlines by a month that are different the carrot the community college annual reporting analysis tool was due january 31st that is moved to december 31st the annual financial reports has the same deadline but it impacts information going into those other reports so we

are going to have to finish the audit quicker and compile any financial statements as quick as real quick i mean just way high level out of curiosity how is all this funded at the state davis is this totally unfunded within the the state of texas or what i am concerned about or curious about is that if we

go through and get rid of department of education in worst case and you know the goes to crap do we suffer any kind of exposure if the federal government goes wild and does stupid things stupid things yes we do and so the grants that mr flores mentioned earlier when the administration these are grants that congress had already

allocated and then the administration said we are going to cap administrative overhead at fifteen and so utep felt it much more significantly than we did but there are grants that we have as well where that nsf nih etc grants when they are capped at fifteen and they'd already been allocated i do not have an issue with saying

from this point forward if you apply for a grant your administrative overhead must be no more than fifteen but within the rules and regulations that existed yesterday and now today we say we are going to cap you at fifteen for what we have already allocated that is caused a lot of havoc across higher education not just in

the state but in the nation in addition there is several grants that the team and i are working on that the college has that the federal government has frozen and is in the process of eliminating and we have real individuals that are running good grants that have we we have had for twenty plus years that we are

now going to plus years that we are now going to lose it is mostly at the grant level for grants but not the general for grants but not the general operation it is at the grant level on one hand on the other hand it is at the pel so the bbb the big beautiful bill from the house

version was going to impact 360 zero students in the state of texas that would lose pel completely so that is a significant impact to the state and to it would be a significant impact to us dr amaya can you remind me what we estimated we estimated i think nine million of a pel hit and so we administer

approximately 60 million so we'd be looking at about a fifteen hit to we'd be looking at about a fifteen hit to pel and this is an unknown deadline right it is on the senate side the senate fixed a lot senator cassidy from louisiana the chair fixed a lot but it has to go back to the house and

the house has to agree to those the house has to agree to those wow so things look good for now that is why you got to be concerned we do not know what the government's going to do cut there there is another bill at the state level that is going to impact this and so that bill proposes

or is changing the threshold for competitive bidding from 50 to for competitive bidding from 50 to 100 zero okay so that will be effective september 1st 2025 that is significant and brought to the presentation today for discussion for discussion because right now we take to the board competitive purchases 50 zero and higher we have to take them

to the board for approval and so that is the board's choice the amount that we take to the for approval we have to competitively build bill them because that is what the state says but that threshold is going from 50 to 100 zero that the state has raised that so the discussion here is for the board to

understand this change and to consider what in september you want us to take to the board for approval for perspective in 2009 the threshold went from 25 zero to 50 so the board at that time said well the threshold for competitive bidding went from 25 to 50 then only bring to us for approval items competitive items bid

competitively bid items for 50 zero so it changed in 2009 this is the same happening going from 50 to 100 so the board can decide what you want us to take to the board for approval that is your decision you can keep it at the 50 or you can say we want we want to move with change

statement it is my understanding that austin community colleges austin community college requires 150 zero to be taken to their board now they still have to comply with the 50 zero bidding rule from the state but their board has decided 150 agreed that is just an example i am not advocating for that it is just an example but

it is your choice what you would like us to bring now the potential impact if we only take items 100 zero and more to you there'll probably be a reduction of about 60 in the items that are taken for your now who approves them besides the board like if it is going to be at 100 zero and

let us say you already approved it on your end and everybody's worked on it by the time it comes to us it is already been vetted by the by the president and by everybody right yes and there is considerable purchasing yes and there is considerable purchasing rules right mr gallo has to comply with tons of competitive bidding

different rules that his office complies with within the law all of that has happened the bid has been evaluated by a committee and then the best choice made it is a very rigorous so i do not i do not think we have had problems in that you know with the bidding process maybe many years ago there were

some issues back that was the judges he was here but i am comfortable with the you know with moving it to a 100 and as and know with moving it to a 100 and as and then i think they did because of inflation and the cost of stuff going up i think that is actually and they have

done it from 2009 i am surprised they did not go higher and surprised they did not go higher and then i do not have any problem with 100 zero 100 zero and then getting an information piece just you know a routine information at a board meeting but not necessarily at a board meeting but not necessarily twenty we

have this i notic you get several contractors we get a lot of contractors no but let us say you were going to bid like the air quite a few bids for that type of work we pre-approved a large pool of contractors maintenance repair and operation called the state list august in july august we bring a long list

of recommend vendors for your review and then for each vendor we put a threshold that we cannot exceed so that we can go to them quickly many times physical plan is working through physical plan is working through emergencies many too many times we go quickly to these vendors and they are based upon good reputation purchasing tips notes

on performance so we have a list that is brought to you and the threshold that we go to and the threshold that we go to mr oh i was just we have i was going back they say that there is this composite bidding process that a group of how does that come compared to that does not change

with this with this rule right change with this with this rule right here it does not what mr flowers was describing vice president flores was describing is exactly the case it is similar we have purchasing has a set of of rules that they have to follow to follow yeah and it is also the one that do not

you have that already vetted by region nineteen also for also for yes so we have pre-approved cooperatives we have could not remember just to give you an idea the purchasing procedure is 26 pages long only could have 27 but it is a very it is a very detailed extensive and that area is always looking at the law

they are very they are very good at complying with the letter of the law very i think that is why we are so comfortable with it going to 100 because you know he is such a the controls they are very good controls within that area and you said austin went all the way to 125 or 115 so

we have that ability to come december to it is not necessarily this threshold this threshold correct so that is just for discussion just for so that is just for discussion just for discussion but i think most of us are comfortable with 100 when it comes to decision with 100 when it comes to decision making so mr here

is the financial aid transfer additional revenue that we are projecting and th this one we are projecting and th this one here we know it is going to change because by this point last year we had received part of this funding this year we have not received usually we are funded by semester and we have not been

reimbursed for our fall or spring yet so the terminology fast here is i do not it is an oxymoron yes it is that it is that so this number is this projection is going to change for us because we haven't received the results of the information we reported for the fall and spring so that will be adjusted

in the next presentation this is the best information we have now what we do know is the rate for semester credit hour is going to increase from credit hour is going to increase from 56 87 56 87 for semester credit hour for dual credit or college student to 58 52 this projection of five four million is basically

from information we did in 2024 because we haven't gotten to 25 information so it is going to change but we are still awaiting payments for the current so this is the other part of our appropriation number that we have in our appropriation number that we have in our projection under benefits we know the state is increasing health

insurance rates by four by eight and so another of the must be funded items you are going to see is related to this eight increase in health insurance and dental insurance so we are asking for an additional 450 zero supplement our budget for health insurance and then insurance and then 25 for the dental indemnity it is because

of the state increasing that rate now what we haven't seen yet so we fund 50 of the health insurance costs and we receive an appropriation from the state for the other half of about state for the other half of about seven three zero seven three zero we do not know what the new appropriation is yet we are

still waiting for that appropriation amount to know usually the state increases their appropriation for their 50 we do not know what that number is yet so these are other things impacting our budget development on trs we do not expect a change in the competition yes expect a change in the competition yes sir so funding for education at

state level is separate for the community college than in four-year college than k12 education that is correct but for health care and stuff like that do they coordinate the whole thing so we are competitive with utp on health benefits or something not competitive but we are not they have to negotiate theirs at four-year level and we negotiate

as community colleges and that kind of thing well the way the state funds each of those respective sectors is different those respective sectors is different okay yeah they cannot even agree on that they cannot even agree on that no so towards developing the 2526 budget these are the projected revenues for 2526 the first column we compare them

to the current adopted budget revenues that we have as a basis for comparison in the middle column those are the revenues we are projecting for next year so for appropriation we are projecting 49 five we are projecting 49 five million in appropriation that is the foundation appropriation along with the past appropriation along with the past 49 six

49 six that is an increase of five four million that is an increase of five four million twelve three twelve three overhead recovery for the reasons where this discussion was on overhead recovery grants we are forecasting a decrease for that but that is a changing number still we are as dr sata said the federal environment is changing

so that impacts our projections so if they take the cap off of the nsf funds then our projection may go up a little bit or if they make the capuh restrictive then we will bring in less overhead recovery so we are subject to the whims of the state and the federal government on overhead recovery okay so the

ten two is what each vice president gets to take a chunk of and salary increase that comes out of the ten million out of the i am sorry well if you take our last year budget and this year budget that you are and this year budget that you are projecting oh i see yes that tip two is

the whatever the vice presidents decide they need in each one of their divisions in salaries and in salaries and supplies huh the board determines our salary well it is part of the deal we got we got to cover it but if you can be absent we will not have to cut anybody's salary but that that is the

i can guarantee you we are not going to decrease anybody's but salary that is what we are looking at judge that is what we have available to us as we continue to move forward and project the budget ten two is what we have to work with that is correct that is all i want based on the base

budget based on the base budget okay so moving to the revenue projections for local funds on the tuition and fees line item you see projected tuition and fees of 42 five million that is based upon the enrollment in the current year we are budgeting that flat and so that results in additional revenue of three four million increase

of eight seven to that line item and then property tax revenue that reflects the tax on new property the one 666 million dollars that is the what we will receive from new property that is a nice increase other income based when we did this projection on interest income the market was very different the market the fed said

we are going to cut two times and then rates at the end of year going to be at two and a quarter now things turn the other way the fed did not cut and they are signaling no more cuts so it is really difficult to project out interest income what we do is we take a very conservative

number five million we are going to keep it again so that we do not think will go under five million so that number is sustainable for us so then the subtotal for projected so then the subtotal for projected revenues is 173 seven million when we add is 173 seven million when we add self-supporting projected revenues of three

million the total projected revenues for 2526 are 176 seven million that is going to be the budget for next year because we cannot exceed that that amount so that is an increase from the current adopted budget of 166 four million compared to what is projected so it is going to be a positive variance of ten five million

or an increase of six sixteen of projected or an increase of six sixteen of projected revenues so now we see those projected revenues if we were to disagregate them and show them by type property tax revenues expressed as a percentage is 42 two of the total projected operating budget followed by operating budget followed by appropriations 49 five

million 28 followed by tuition and fees 42 five or 24 followed by other income which is interest and followed by self-supporting and overhead recovery that will comprise the projected budget for next year and that is how the so now we look at the baseline budget this is this is all the submissions from the executive level this is

what the budget office did in the may time period taking all the submissions from the executive levels and compiling a baseline budget based upon what they submitted so that middle column is the baseline budget and you see by executive level area what those projected budgets are that they are requesting and so it comes to 162 four it

comes to 162 four million compared to the adopted current budget of 163 four that is a decrease of one million there is a couple of variances that are large in here if you look at the one two million decrease there but you see an increase in the line item row below that is because in the instructional area

they did some reallocation they moved some programs from one area to another so the area they are going into is an increase the area they are coming from is a is a decrease so the workforce and continuing education decreased by one two million however those areas moved over to workforce instruction and workforce education instruction and workforce education

616 zero 616 zero this reflects the movement of position vacant positions and filling them at lower levels this re this reflects the movement of positions largely this will continue to move all the way through august the 31st this is a baseline budget as of may 31st laura's team will continue to work on adjusting the baseline budget all

the way through august 31st so this is the baseline budget as we project and so when you add in the self-supporting accounts down here totaling three million we are looking at a baseline budget of 165 five million compared to the current operating budget of 166 five basically down a million dollars yes basically down a million dollars yes

sir i am just looking so you had a million2 and you get 66 still 602 zero and you add to that the 278 zero it is almost 900 zero that you are taking out of that which is essentially the bottom line everything else balances out where did the other i mean how come you lost 600 zero in

workforce and somebody's not complaining about i lost you know oh we gave you 600 zero back no you lost you lost 600 and you lost almost 300 zero out of finance who gave that up and what so in finance the 278 zero so in finance the 278 zero yeah so we maintain we maintain a clearing account that

clearing account is an account is used to fund other activities that were not originally budgeted so if somebody says you know i really need to buy this software i need this item purchase it is not in my budget the budget the finance area the finance area will do a transfer from the clearing account out so that is

a negative so you are just saying supplementing it you are saying is next year i just do not need 300 zero as much as i did last need 300 zero as much as i did last year yes okay so that is the movement i understand that it is just that all of a sudden somebody says it is

strange see i just do not need that much money and it seems like workforce and continue education still is if you see i gave 600 zero to instruction in workforce yeah well workforce continuing yeah well workforce continuing 62 zero 62 zero and so okay if they think they need a better job with less well that is good

with less well that is good yes okay a lot of these are also based on retirements mr oxen so you have a faculty position that is been in the position for a number of years we are recognized at our board meeting russ meyers who is a great faculty member has been with the institution for a significant period

of time his wage has increased every year and when he retires we are able to hire a faculty member at a starting wage say 600 zero well depending on how many how many retire theoretically we many how many retire theoretically we could absolutely it is just good that you can see people net effect hey i can do

a better job next year i can do as good a job this year as i did last year as less money that is it is all right particularly considering inflation go up 33 mr do not mind me jumping in a lot of that 616 zero is reflects the movement of the law enforcement academy from adp area to

enforcement academy from adp area to josh but your point is well taken yeah i still i do not you move it but you still somebody's coming up with 62 zero less so another so doing more with less we did eliminate some duplication so we had two offices running very similar customized training and grants and realized with the

retirement of one of the directors we could merge those two offices into one director and so that is some of the savings there as well i am not telling you that you know somebody sneaky would go back and justify having two offices and argue that you do not need to give up 600 i think you did a

good job myself i would try to hide that second office and see if i can so it is if i think your point is extremely well taken mr herster given the fact that you will see slightly later in vice president flores's presentation that we are going to make some adjustments because so when we do a salary enhancement

for our faculty we say a portion is going towards the table and a portion is going towards a theoretic raise the employee the faculty member receives all of it but we adjust the table and we we have never done that on the staff side and that is part of the reason some of those vacancies are still vacant

is because we are having a harder time competing for staff particularly at lower levels of the institution or starting pay and so what i have asked the staff to do is to make according adjustments to tables for staff so that in the future we will not have the same challenge so you are saying it is all i's

fault that no i am saying that in the past it was not just something that we did and i have asked vice president flores and ap field to work on that for us so that we do not have as hard a time recruiting so you are going to see a significant number probably in the 600 zero range

that is going to be an adjustment to tables so that in the future we will not have ten million of future we will not have ten million of vacancies okay that is good i still would hide that second office it is a good thing you are not running that program it would be fully justified i can make

so now we look at the baseline budget when you break it out by functional area this is what it looks like in this particular case instruction is still at 54 eight still at 54 eight million right here representing 33 of the budget followed by institutional support over here at 50 million interestingly enough when you combine instruction with

academic combine instruction with academic support that represents like 44 of the budget and that is the way it should be supporting students and when you add student services to that you are close to over 50 of the budget going to supporting students so you see how the allocation of budgets is additionally in here you have as part

of the 165 four million baseline budget twenty million is dedicated to academic support and also physical plant thirteen two million student services 122 million public service three eight research 214 zero over here and then self-supporting one three million transfers of seven five million so that is how by functional million so that is how by functional area the

baseline budget would be the baseline budget would be distributed if we look at that same baseline budget by expense category then you look at it going like 73 to salaries when you consider faculty salaries of 56 four 56 five million and then you have staff salaries of 50 million and then you have benefits of eight and a

half million over 70 of the budget goes to staff salaries and faculty the rest of it is distributed to supplies 28 million transfer seven five a small amount to travel one three equipment a small amount to travel one three equipment one and then contingency up here six five million this contains a bianium reserve in case appropriations do

not come through something happens at the state level and they cut funding on something this is just in case that is mitigating the risk in budget development by doing that so this is how by expense category the baseline budget which is the starting point for for the budget for the year is broken down now these are the

additional funding requests this is additional funding requests this is preliminary and so it is broken down into two categories the critical needs those are must be funded items central appraisal district has raised their budget they pass on the prorated share to the different taxing entities our proportionate share is 69 nine zero insurance rates keep on rising and

so mr raela projects needing 264 zero more for rising insurance rates we talked about gazsby 101 the impact of implementing that it is going to hit have a hit of about 200 zero we talked about the eight increase in health insurance 450 zero medicare as in payrolls go up then the related payroll taxes go up in this

case it is medicare we are estimating 80 zero increase the dental insurance is also tied to the eight increase from ers for insurance rates and then the reserve for insurance rates and then the reserve for trsp appropriation so that is the matching portion that the employer pays largely trs so we have more employees our proportionate share of

that is half of eight and a quarter so resulting in 210 zero more that we are going to need and then it software some of the contracts have built-in escalation clauses ten or fifteen so those are increases related to software maintenance that are built in to the contracts so the critical items total contracts so the critical items

total one 665 one 665 zero one 665 zero you are going to see that number in just a little bit on the budget strategy slide and so these other funding requests are the ones that are being vetted by dr sarata and they are broken out by executive level here and those total two four million at the moment

i can see where that 600 zero you saved me has now been invested in one six million central so you saved me 600 zero and you wanted one six saved me 600 zero and you wanted one six back so these are the additional funding requests and the two categories within that category that are being that category that

are being considered so this is where everything gets collapsed together this is one slide that brings in your projected revenues of 176 million and then we just talked about the baseline budget 165 five million that yields an initial budget surplus of now we just talked about the must be funded on the additional funding funded on the additional

funding requests of one six million and so the next item here is a six adjustment to the salary tables that dr sarata mentioned is going to help us with recruiting and retaining staff associate vice president melenna field and her team have done u a process to adjust the tables by six and so the impact of that would

be an i would say that 400 zero of that is related to full-time staff the other 200 zero of that number is to bring anybody making less than ten an hour up to ten and that is about 282 hour up to ten and that is about 282 partners we still have people making less than ten i thought

we agreed at the last even when christina was here that they were going to we have worked on it dr graham and we have a good handle on it at this point where we believe that this will cover all employees we had a number of part-time employees that were under ten and then some of our work study

and then some of our work study areas it'll impact 125 part- timerrs making less than ten an hour and then on the six adjustment it'll impact 395 part- timerrs impacted by increasing the tables by six so part- timerrs are about five four 525 part- timerrs will be impacted by this increase there'll be about 127 full-timers impacted as

if the tables are increased by six and then there is about 162 vacant positions that are in recruitment that would be impacted as well so all together the six increase is going to impact 463 zero raising the part- timerrs to ten up to ten has an impact of about 28 zero all told this increase right here that

will help us recruit and retain staff has a current value of 672 what i would tell you is when this study was done by the hr by miss field's hr team it does not consider if the board does a salary increase does a salary increase then this table amount will go down because we did it before any

salary increase so if you do a three increase as an example for the next year the 463 zero will probably go down to the 463 zero will probably go down to 230 zero so this is this number here is very preliminary because we do not know what the board's going to approve as an increase but it will

help with retaining and recruiting staff as dr at mentioned we have a lot of positions the lower levels that are making under the amount that these tables would be adjusted to so they will see a bump from that this increase will only affect one administrative person only one the majority of the rest will be classified staff will

be impacted and on the ten increase bring everybody up to ten only three full-timers that were affected by that all the rest were part- timerrs so we this process will help align those dollar values i do not know u miss field did i leave anything off no other than how critical it is that we adjust the tables

because it is been since 2016 that we haven't seen any tables for the employees so it is so that has a value of 672 zero so the these are kind of two items that we feel are very important to approve these two increases and that will still yield a surplus of eight nine million and so you saw

the value of the additional request at two four million here and so that would leave still if that was funded an amount to increase the bianium reserve by six five million now that is the very basic column here what you have in the one two three up to five scenarios we have added the value of a salary

enhancement at one in case we wanted to do some multiples or half of a percentage you know what one is valued at but here you see the value of a two enhancement three so forth and so on if we look at the three column here what we see is with a three salary increase which is close to

what inflation is you still see a surplus of three four million that would go to so these are these are at the moment with the preliminary numbers that have been presented to you how the outlook are there any are there any questions related to this related to this so next we are going to talk about the 4-year

financial model it has been updated and has current numbers in it from last year and so this model chooses to analyze future capacity should we need to raise something then the model is available for that if we wanted to raise tuition and you chose to approve tuition rates this model could project that if you felt the need

to raise property taxes this model could project that as well it is a tool to use in modeling different budget to use in modeling different budget scenarios that might be considered and so it tracks revenue sources that are trending higher than in previous years enroll if enrollment is growing it can tell you what the impact of that

might be if state appropriations are growing as well and there is changes we can model that also other factors or assumptions it covers two legislative periods so it covers four years in case we need to do that if you wanted to as i said tuition increases which are not on discussion or recommended u and also it implies

steady property valuation increases and assumes regular salary enhancement so this is a static model this is a pdf of the model and so it has a lot of information in it and it has a lot of pieces to it and so this is what the model looks like and then the second part of this model shows the

impact of fund balance that is a little bit dizzying i know but it is the it is the process we go through in case we want to consider increasing fund balance we maintain a fund balance of 25 of fund balance to operating budget and so those considerations are in here it considers transfers to project reserve a lot

of different things so at this point i do not know if anybody has any questions related to the next steps going forward we will continue to recruit efforts for summer and fall registration update revenue projections with final state appropriation numbers that might be provided hopefully we will get the fast funding that will help us project that better

and miss davis will continue to compute the no new revenue rate as she receives updated revenue rate as she receives updated information and we will get the final appraisal ruled in july and miss stasis's team will continue to move the baseline budget for vacancies and hires and all that is going on she'll continue to advance it forward

and then dr sarata will be reviewing additional funding requests that have been submitted and then we will prepare for the final budget presentation workshop to the board of trustees which will be in the last board meeting planning for adopting the budget june 30th we should get updated property appraisal july 25th is a deadline for early august there

might be either in late july or early august probably august might there should be a board meeting that board meeting is very important because that is where the salary enhancement if one is going to be passed needs to be passed for hr to have enough time to update the banner system so that is why that is scheduled

in early august that is a very important date for us and then finally august the regular board meeting will u with the adoption of the 2526 operating budget and the no new revenue tax rate will be approved by the board of trustees if there is no questions then thank you thank you and we do not need to

go on any concession so we are concession so we are
