here with the tanes i was a third coach and i loved it katie was one of my players she was a hell of a player let me tell you my daughter got a scholarship to play here which i was so proud because i played here and let me tell you what i saw out of coach gutierrez was

great she was like my daughter said positive with the girls she was great coaching out there and like i told you with my experience of being a high school coach also head coach for many years i see coach being a heck of a coach out there and i would like for you guys to keep giving her the

opportunity to keep coaching opportunity to keep coaching thanks thank you good afternoon my name is anna luc silva and i stand before you not just as a student athlete but as someone whose life has been genuinely impacted by coach gutierrez when i first joined this program i was unsure of myself did not know if i had what

it took but not just as a sport but in life but coach gutierrez did not just train us to compete but she trained us to believe in ourselves she held us at an account accountable showed us how to lead with integrity and taught us effort and respect it mattered just as not what just mattered on the scoreboard

after all this was not just about the wins or the stats it was not about developing us as people and she made sure of that every single day i know decisions are complex and sometimes difficult but i am asking you to consider the whole picture and not just the outcome of this season for a moment in time

and the cons consideration with coach we had heartful times and very strong times and sad times and honestly i could say that we genuinely bonded as a team for a moment for coach gave to this team and this school she showed us for us not just on the field but off the field she created a culture of

trust growth and resilience it hurts to see someone who gave us so much let go so quickly especially since we have one more year with her and i believe that everything in me that deserves a chance to continue doing what she does best guiding coaching and changing lives like she changed mine thank you for hearing me and

i speak not just for myself but for many who might not have the words but who feel some remorse and some deep felt thank you thank you good evening i just wanted to come on here and say like coach gi really brought out like something in me she made me feel so comfortable on the field you know

i am sort of kind of timid at times and like normally for college teams you are not really like comfortable with a coach but she really made me feel real safe and comfortable and she like she is very cheerful sometimes she is you know she can be like how do i say this like a coach does that

make sense like she could just like set the tone right away and i am just really hoping we get the outcome we all want thank you okay forces hello i know decisions like these are complicated but i want to speak honestly about coach gutierrez and how she means to us she is not just a coach she is

a mentor a role model and a backbone to this team coach g has pushed us to grow not just as athletes but as people she is shown up every day with energy discipline and belief in us even when we doubted ourselves our team culture our unity and our progress both on and off the field are a direct

reflection of her leadership lead of her leadership i have personally learned consistency preparation work ethnic and many other things and i know i am not the only one the impact she made here does not just live in wins and losses it lives in who we are becoming this decision is not just about one person it affects all

of us and we are not ready to lose her thank you i appreciate your time thank you hello i am just here to say i am one of the parents to the athletes also a coach for city and travel ball a lot of the girls that have gone through coach gutierrez have come from our team and there

is nothing but positive things coming out of everybody i have talked to them i have asked them and positivity is all everybody has to say about her she is great she is just a great coach she is very positive teaches these girls a lot from the person they are going to become to the players they are thank

you so okay section one seven presentations by individuals groups and organizations item one seven one dr william sarata college president will recognize individuals who have retired from el paso community who have retired from el paso community college chair hagerty and members of the board these are always bittersweet moments when we have an individual who has earned their

retirement mr russ meyers started at el paso community college on april 23rd 1990 as a programmer analyst he later became a senior programmer analyst working on a variety of projects including the epcc telephone registration system he joined the adjunct faculty ranks in 1993 within the itsc discipline mr myers enjoyed teaching and became a full-time faculty member starting

in the fall of 1996 he taught a wide variety of technologies including operating systems spreadsheets databases programming and networking he served as an itsc discipline coordinator from 1997 to 2021 a few major initiatives included the start of the cisco academy the 60-hour rule degree changes and course development for multiple courses during his time as a faculty member

he was the host of epcc tv computer train show for eight years and 80 episodes for a variety of epcc departments he created databases and trained staff to help them with their day-to-day responsibilities for the institutional effectiveness department he created databases to track epcc standing committees and memberships epcc college policies and procedures and the program review he

continued to share his expertise in data management by creating a database to track area improvement plans across the college for the institutional planning department for the dual credit department mr myers created a database to track area high school dual credit locations contact personnel and required textbooks materials for dual credit course offerings his most recent project has been

for the epcc foundation he created a database to track donors and donations received by the college an interesting side note is that mr myers met his wife norgas at epcc a work study in the accounting services department in the early 90s after a 30-year educational career ending as a principal mrs myers now works as an adjunct faculty

member in the educational psychology discip discipline his daughter lindsay started her education at epcc graduated with a mechanical engineering degree from nmsu and started working as a project manager for the physical plant department here at epcc in 2024 russy has contributed much to the success of the college through his expert teaching for our students his attention to

detail on the many projects he has led and his collegial attitude after a short break mr myers intends to return as an adjunct for the itsc discipline i'd have to share i'd be remiss if i did not share mr meyers is an avid bowler and has bowled several perfect games so dr roberts when he served as interim

president would brag about how his team would win bowling tournament because he ensured that mr meyers was on his team and in a point of personal pride i actually won the bowling tournament the year mr meyers did not attend so thank you mr myers on behalf of the college we wish you the best in your retirement we

thank you for your 35 years of service and we look forward to welcoming you back so if you'd please item one seven two optional presentations will be made by the presidents of the classified staff association the professional staff association the faculty association and the student government association government association gosh to piggy back on professor meyers retiring and

president sarat's winning the championship the first year as i recall my team won the championship the year after that however and this still is a crawl in my throat mr president sarata beat me for high score by seven lousy beat me for high score by seven lousy pins it was a trying year for sure it was oh

well i look forward to a rematch greetings trustees mr president vice presidents deans acting deans guests both live and in the vastness of the unknown two months ago i gave a slideshow presentation on epcc and the as you can see on the screen the terrible horrible no good very bad bill known as senate bill 37 for your

reading enjoyment unfortunately the dominant political party in texas and the governor in their infinite and divine wisdom chose to pass and sign into law this total abomination atrocity obscinity of freedom of democracy today i present a shortened version of the slideshow based on the updated version of the farcical and i paraphrase the declaration of independence the history

of the president lieutenant governor and dominant political party of texas is a history of repeated injuries and history of repeated injuries and usurppations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over texas political colleges and universities to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world thus i offer a comp comparison between epcc

and offer a comp comparison between epcc and sb37 number one at epcc the faculty association and the faculty senate are established by and operated by the epcc faculty association bylaws by the epcc faculty association bylaws sb37 only the governing board you find people of an institution the board of trustees of higher education may establish a faculty council

or senate based on the draconian guidelines set forth in the draconian guidelines set forth in the bill number two faculty members elect one full-time and one adjunct at large senator from each of the six cpcc campuses and two full-time senators from each academic division under sp37 the new senate will consist of at least two representatives from each

college or school including one member appointed by the college president because this bill is so poorly written does that mean one of the two from each college or school will be appointed by the president or does it mean one total will be appointed by the president comparison three the faculty association president full-time vice president secretary are granted

paid release hours under sp 37 members of the faculty council or senate are not entitled to compensation or reimbursement of expenses unless approved by the board of trustees number four the faculty association officers and faculty senators serve terms of two years and are not subject to term limits under sp 37 faculty senators are appointed by the epcc

president may serve up to six consecutive one-year terms and may only be reappointed after a two-year absence elected senators serve one two-year term and can only be reelected after two year two-year absence and i might add here this is highly hypocritical of the legislature and the governor and the lieutenant governor imposing term limits on us but not

themselves and number five the faculty association executive committee consisting of the president myself full-time vice president adjunct vice president and secretary are elected by the faculty for a term of two years and can be reelected under sp37 the epcc president shall appoint a presiding officer associate presiding officer and secretary for members of the faculty council or senate

appointing officers and number six sometimes the epcc faculty association senate passes resolutions that do not need administrative consent such as approving the minutes or the resolution passed this academic year urging all faculty to be courteous and aware of the 10-minute time between classes under 10-minute time between classes under sp37 a faculty council or senate is advisory only

and may not be delegated the final decision-making authority on any manner presumably that means administration or the trustees or both must approve everything the association senate passes including the mundane resolutions such as those stated above that is all y'all need is more work why this ridiculous bill is being advocated by the dominant political party of texas all

because lieutenant governor dan patrick is throwing a hissy fit because the ut austin faculty senate had the audacity to pass a resolution opposing something patrick was in favor of said political party claims to be the defender of democracy in america yet this bill is nothing less than a blatant attempt by that party and patrick to destroy democracy

in texas public colleges and universities because they believe without any proof whatsoever that quote loony marxist professors are supposedly indoctrinating students to quote hate america and turn them into socialists and communists in fact sub political party and the lieutenant governor are attempting to indoctrinate students toward their own far-right propagandistic beliefs back in april the faculty senate passed

a resolution i will not read the whole thing but just go to the bottom whereas sp 37 proposes to destroy the democratic way the epc faculty senate has chosen and operates the epcc faculty senate duly assembled does hereby condemn and oppose the undemocratic vile and repugnant sb37 is currently proposed under sp 37 you the members of the

epcc board of tr trustees will have to approve that resolution if it had happened in the new senate what will judge going back to open forum i believe michelle diaz is here in the hello i am here on behalf of coach gutierrez's i am here on behalf of coach gutierrez's part despite the season that we had the

past two years i have been here for the past two years i know it did not go our way and what it we expected and wanted it to be despite all that i feel she is a very good coach completely gives back to her community has a positive outlook not only on as us on players but wants

us to achieve as women outside of softball and school as well as we enter the real world and because of that i stand with her well you did great thank you okay thank you section one eight communications item one eight one discussion and review regarding data statistics policies and general information related to el paso community chair hagerty

and members of the board i had promised to provide a legislative update during the may meeting and we had not yet finished the legislature so we postponed that to this meeting i do want to provide you with an update on the legislature and what the legislature produced out of the legislative session we have to start the legislative

session with commissioner roser so commissioner keller served as the commissioner of higher education for just under five years so two legislative sessions commissioner keller was a great friend to community colleges and to epcc in particular and so there were big shoes to fill he went on to serve as president university of north texas where he still is

currently and dr roser i was appointed to the advisory committee by the coordinating board so chair faras of the coordinating board vice chair hout and secretary anoir joined three college and university administrators i represented the community college sector dr james hallmark from texas a m system and then dr jay hartzell the former president of ut austin now

president of smu served on the advisory committee we reached out to individuals and encouraged them to consider the commissioner of higher education dr roser was one of the individuals that i was one of the folks who reached out to him so we are very pleased that dr roser was willing to take on this role he started the

job i believe on january the three and then we went straight into the legislative went straight into the legislative session i will touch on a couple of things just as a as a reminder for the board so in the 2023 legislative session there were three themes that came out of the commission for community college finance which mr

hunt from el paso chaired we were looking at funding community colleges based on outcomes we are very focused on affordability for students as well as on investments in college capacity so this was a group of legislators as well as philanthropy mr hunt and b representing business and then we had four presidents that served on the committee as

well as the key components of house bill eight was the fast program we just had a budget workshop so all of you are familiar with the fast program it is financial aid for swift transfer shared services was a big part of this performance tier which is outcomesbased so 95 of the funding out of resulting out of house

bill eight goes towards outcomesbased funding for el paso community college 100 of our funding is based on performance tier there is we set aside five of the total funding which is distributed to the colleges that have small tax bases to help them with regards to their base tier funding so the large colleges will never qualify for base

tier funding and then finally the community college standing advisory committee was put together commissioner keller asked that i chair that i continue to serve as chair of that committee and will serve in that capacity and through our legislative focus areas for this legislative session was the supplemental appropriations request so this our funding mechanism is based on projections

and we receive that funding and then once the actual outcomes come forward the coordinating board calculates what that is and we wanted to ensure that our supplemental appropriations request was approved before funding for the regular session so this ended up being 89 five million for the community college sector the legislature did fund that we were asking for

full funding for the formula for the next bienium based on outcomes we wanted to include private institutions in transfer so the institution that makes the most sense is mlennon community college they are located in waco their number one transfer partner is baylor mr mendes as your daughter attends baylor is baylor and they were not receiving credit for

students who transferred to baylor so we wanted to make sure we corrected that error and so now students who transfer to private colleges and universities in the state of texas will count towards performance-based funding as well among our areas of focus was also continuing to scale workforce partnerships we certainly understand that the texas economy continues to grow

we are the from our perspective we are the fuel for that economy continuing to grow the community colleges produce 95 96 of all career technical education degrees and certificates in the state and so we want to continue to move forward with that state agency workforce credentials this was something that we were keeping an eye on and ensuring

that we were a part of it last legislative session the legislature reduced the qualifications for programmers in particular that are that were employed by the state diir moved forward with this and so this these were laws that we were continuing to keep an eye on and then we wanted to ensure that we were continuing to have access

to nursing clinical rotation slots there were for-profit institutions that were offering hospitals payment for those clinical rotation slots and so we felt that it was important for us to ensure that the public institutions had access to those as well we also went in and made sure that our legislature knew who we were and what we did we

started this back in 2019 2021 sessions we serve well over 700 zero students in the in the 50 community colleges we awarded over 125 zero degrees and certificates as i indicated earlier we provide 96 of all career and technical education certificates and degrees so this was important for us to ensure that the legislature understood this senate bill

one is the budget senate bill one codified and ensured that the 89 five million of the supplemental appropriations was there and moved forward they fully funded the community college sector now that currently the funds are now at two four billion dollars before the 2023 legislative session they were at one eight billion for the 50 community colleges teog

is the student work study program tog is student aid state aid for students they increased that from 222 million to 306 two million and then the fast resources went from 78 six to 165 two million so we felt that it was a successful session i will touch on a couple of bills i probably will not touch on

senate bill 37 since dr bham already covered that for me but seventeen bill senate bill 1786 is the cleanup bill to house bill eight it is its companion was house bill 2110 some key pieces of that particular bill was it was expanding access to dual credit and defining what a high school student is there was no definition

of what high school was in statute prior to this so we were saying dual credit is for students that are in grades nine through twelve that expanded that access for them in addition it focused on opportunities for students to earn those college credits again the allocation was just over two four billion it is about a two almost

a two and a five increase you see in the graphic it went from one eight to two to now two four billion and again those transfers that go to private institutions will count as long as they are in texas senate bill 37 i will touch on a couple of areas dr bham's absolutely right it expanded authority of

the governing board over the hiring of not just me and legal counsel but dr smith and his position the board has the right to veto that if i come forward with a recommendation that the board does not agree with on that particular position the board can veto that there are annual reports that the legislature required the governing

board to create the faculty council again dr bham covered much of this the faculty senates the governing board exclusively creates faculty senates now so that has to come through you see the requirements it can only be 60 it has to be capped at 60 members we are working with legal counsel as well as with dr bham to

ensure that we have everything in order to move forward with this i will share with you that on september 1st the faculty senate as it currently exists will be abolished based on statute so we have to work u with the board as well as with faculty senate to ensure that we are meeting the requirements that are laid

out by the state which we will work with legal counsel to ensure that and we will continue to meet with dr bernham and his colleagues again lots of additional duties as assigned by the legislature with regards to faculty grievances and hiring again i shared with you the executive searches and then the coordinating board the governor will appoint

an anbuds person who will then be a part of the coordinating board but it reports directly to the governor who will investigate and serve as a leazison between the public the legislature as well as institutions of higher education the legislature continuously passes bills senate bill 1786 from my perspective was a very good bill senate bill 37 is

a challenging bill a challenging bill that we will work with we will work with legal counsel to ensure that we are in compliance with the law and to ensure that our faculty continue to have representation but that is a small gamut of what the legislature looked at i picked items that were very pertinent to the college and

to the function of the institution i am happy to entertain any questions that the board may have dr tro there is supposed to be a special session anything contained currently judge so the the governor listed six items that he wanted to look at they were specific bills that had not made it through the session of one of

them the most notorious is the bill on hemp hemp products and so what you are looking at there is real concerns from the lieutenant governor who is been very vocal about this that it should be banned completely from the business sector it raises estimates are that it raises a billion dollars in tax revenue if the legislature chooses

to ban that then they have to figure out where that billion dollars of tax revenue comes from or what they cut it brings in a billion dollars now that is what we are told that is that is the estimate of the product within the state of texas but there is six specific items that the governor has asked

the governor can expand that there is nothing related to higher education at this point we do not anticipate that anything with regards to higher education will be brought higher education will be brought forward thank you section one nine board of trustees business items one nine one and item one nine two will be discussed after executive session section

one ten board reports item section one ten board reports item one ten one ten one treasures report item one ten one may 31 2025 financial statements no action is required item eleven ten two president's report item eleven ten two one dr william serata college president will update the board of trustees and audience on recent events that have

for you to just relate what you told me about these people actually when you say security guard service all of a sudden that ranges somewhere somebody walking around with an ar-15 to somebody with a cell phone you know tell what the security guard really encompasses and their training and what they have and that kind of thing sure

i can i can give you a brief description of what they do and yeah chief wants to add any more he is welcome to these are security staff that are licensed however they do not carry weapons or tasers as you asked me about so any issues that they communicate we have them covering evenings and weekends at the

five campuses and the administrative services center likewise we have two that cover the asc daily any incidents they reach out to the lieutenant on call so we have a lieutenant every evening and weekend and obviously chief that are on call same for any daytime operations here at the asc yeah i just think it is important to note

that they really are just a walking around walking mobile alert service and really that is what they are and that is a i you cannot describe something more than a vital function that you know that goes it is something we need that sort of bridges the gap between you know a locked door and having chief ramirez and

his people you know out there you know standing guard i think i think that is probably the probably best money probably the probably best money spent yes sir any other questions yes i have a question how much did we spend previously on these services i it looks did it go from 458785 to the current amount that is

been to the current amount that is been requested this is for three years this is for so the current amount is for the three years so it is an annual contract so the total for the first year would be the total for the first year would be 458 78560 the amount per year being really the amount per

year being really changed there is an increase so we are meeting whatever the increase is for the contract with merchant security but i do not have year's numbers i would need to get that to you do you know if we used a full amount or did you end up using less or more than what was requested i

am going to i am going to ask chief real quick on that mr we talked about as far as understanding this a contingency fund so for the maximum you project what it might be but you are not obligating to use this much right and so previously when we asked for these funds one of the things that we

are doing is this is making up for vacant police department positions so as we add more staff we are then able to reduce our reliance on the security staff so it can be variable but that would be the maximum that we would be spending each year so i do not know did we if we spent the whole

budget this past year chief no sir we have not yet no so we still have some funds left especially because sometimes in what happens is that if one of the officers security officers does not show of course we are not we are not charged for that so and we keep track of every on a daily basis if

they do not show or not because we are required to keep track of the money and then also i have a system in place that tells me that every where everybody's at and whether they show up or not so if they do not show up do you have one of your the officers get overtime and then they

come in or how that and then they come in or how that situation it is mainly it is mainly the the security officers that are working at night time and we do have an officer assigned with them at nighttime so again the officer that is working with them at night time that officer covers you know you know

whatever is left uncovered and then in the during the day of course we could pick up u you know what whatever work is not done by them you know we are here i have more people that are assigned during the day so we are able to cover that so and do they work mostly part-time or no ma'am

all the officers that we have at this time are they are working have at this time are they are working full-time fulltime yes ma'am excuse me when you say somebody does not show up just out of curiosity what kind of non-attendance rate do you see out of the security service it just depends actually the the crew that

we have right now they are pretty reliable they seldom call in late or arrive or do not show up so they are pretty reliable they should they do show up to work so every now and then they do not of course you know so more or less out of that amount that was approved before how much was

spent or how much was left or that i do not i do not know ma'am i do not i do not have that information i can i can give you that information but okay and when you say that there is positions that haven't been filled by police officers so you have vacant positions what do you attribute that

to and okay we currently we do get a lot of applicants or i should not say a lot of applicants we do get applicants but the problem is that a good majority of the applicants that we are receiving or getting do not actually have a peace officer license which is the main requirement they see the announcement and

they believe that they can apply for it but if they do not have a peace officer license then they are not they are not qualified for the position that is one of the really m one of the main problems the other problem is that they are not clearing the background they some of the applicants that we have

received in the past have a pretty serious background they have some serious problems and i do not accept them i do not i do not run them through so they fail the background checks is not the epcc offering the peace license on a kind of a fast track that i know of they have two courses one it

is running during the day during the day hours and i believe that academy is i want to say seven months and then the other one that are that they usually run in the evening hours because they are less hours you know they take them i believe nine months so that they are always running a class like that

ormies like that so yes ma'am thank you sir yes ma'am any other questions just out of curiosity you are competitive is that a competitive position on people with a police officer's license do they have option to go to some other big city like van horn or something like that yes you know that is that is always a

challenge that you know they want to go someplace else believe that believing that they can do better or improve their pay that is not always the case in the in the case you know with some of the people that have left actually want to come back again because they leave and then it is hasn't turned out too

well for them and they actually want to come them and they actually want to come back yeah but you know it is just it is just going to depend on what they have done you know since they have left if some officers are you know actually have gotten into problems and then i do not accept them so

have we considered any programs like to build a pool or capacity in hiring under a probationary period while if contingent they are enrolled here with us for the peace officer certification we can hire them for a term well if they do not have an a license i cannot hire them as an as officer but even as a

program under a probationary have is that something that we have considered just to build a pooling capacity i am not really sure that i understand the question i will jump in mrs moy so we have worked quite a bit to improve the police officer starting salary and in all the officers within the ranks and we have discussed

several options so been something that we have discussed as a possible option you are talking more like an academy sort of style so it is been on the table but we haven't move forward on that yet any other questions call a question mr exter mr exter i mrs robiss mrs robiss hi miss naha miss naha hi mr
