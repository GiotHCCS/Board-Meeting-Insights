the board u mr graves was so kind to lead this as you know s sp17 was passed in the last legislative session as a result the college must go through an audit to ensure that we are in compliance with s sp7 we contracted with weaver and they conducted an audit for us please thank you for having me

yes it is a pleasure to be here tonight as your contracted internal auditor it is been a long time coming i know we started the proposal process prior to co then co hit and then it all kind of everything happened and then you relet that and we are happy to be here tonight love working with community colleges

throughout the state of texas as dr tarata said the first audit that we got to do for the college this year if we go to the next slide audit i will keep going it'll show up here in a minute that internal audit as the state auditor's office inquire was sending inquiries through all the different oh thank you

i did not realize i had a pointer the state auditor office put out inquiries throughout some a lot of the community colleges and universities throughout the state of texas and essentially asked if they were going to do the an internal audit of s sp17 if not i believe that the sao was going in and doing audits on

a selected basis and so that was our first audit this year that internal audit included the compliance with sb17 as codified within the texas education code section 51 3525 through our procedures ultimately you got a clean report we found no findings as part of the report so there was nothing really to bring you today we did however

have some improvement opportunities that essentially included different documents throughout the college throughout the hiring procedures throughout the onboarding also throughout the website site that essentially could be enhanced or modified to be more clearly in compliance with sp7 there were a few things that were kind of in a gray area and so we brought those to the attention

of college administration and they addressed those immediately and so ultimately that was the audit you got a clean audit report there were no findings just some opportunities for improvement and so i am very happy to bring that to you tonight and let you know that through our audit that again no findings so congratulations again no findings so

congratulations to dr zarata and all the college administration for administration for that questions yes sir yeah i guess i do not understand but it all that goes on i am not in human resources but i see this as sbi seventeen signed into law in 2023 and if you watch the news dei has become a big subject to

look at and there is a presidential order that addresses this concept and i and i say that only because i am familiar with the idea that i heard the words but how does this relate to whatever is going on that is come out of washington and whatever is being proposed what is s sp7 what is the current

position that we should be looking at and how are we responding and do we have anything we need to do be do we have anything we need to do be concerned about that is a big question have at it well as sb seventeen and general counsel i do not know where they are at but they can correct

me or step in at any moment sb7 is from the texas senate and so this is the texas legislature really does not have anything attached to what is going on nationally or federally at the moment this actually came out before the newest federal pronouncements and s sp17 essentially tells public colleges and universities that dei cannot be a

part of hiring practices differential treatment cannot be part of any mandatory training it does not impact curriculum so curriculum is set aside it also does not impact what the college can do to apply for and demonstrate statistics as part of federal grants or to apply part of federal grants or to apply for grants checking to see a

couple other checking to see a couple other things no anti-is it does not impact federal anti-is mination and what goes on in compliance with federal compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws course instruction does not affect student organizations so there can be student organizations that have dei concepts associated with them does not impact those at all does also does

not impact any guest speakers or performers student recruitment or performers student recruitment or admissions and it really is centered around not spending in money related to those topics that are state funded so no state money can be spent on that and so this report is impacted for what the what texas came out with prior to any federal

any federal outlay and we haven't seen any direct impact other than from a federal standpoint yet on mandates for the shells and shell nots other than you know things like the nots other than you know things like the ncaa rules that are coming out in being impacted by that but of course the ncja i am sure will

follow suit so with respect to what our agreement is with you and your organization we you have completed and whatever is going on nationally subse you know subsequent to the swearing of a new president a new administration that has no bear there is no reason to revisit anything that you have in your report here not yet it

is yet it is as far there is been nothing ferally that is been pushed down that impacts or anything that we'd have to revisit but if there did then we would need to rewrite our agreement with you because as far as we are concerned you have we are complete with this report as of what it applied to

when it you know correct yeah we have completed the scope and objectives of this report now as your contracted internal auditor we have a contract i think i believe for three years plus renewal so we are in the process five years part of my clicker went away if we could go back to the prior slide oh that

is fine we also there we go the bottom section there we are also in the middle well actually we are at the tail end of our internal audit risk assessment and so what that is we have performed u a facilitated entity-wide risk assessment that covers pretty much all of the college's operations and significant activities and we went

through we had a halfday meeting with the president and his cabinet and walked through those areas and walk through the risks and we are on the tail end now developing a multi-year internal audit plan that we will bring back to you for approval back to the board of trustees for approval and so we will be presenting that

in the future to you and that will lay out a multi-year plan of other audits that we will do in subsequent years so we are c covered with respect to potential activities that we may be potential activities that we may be subject to correct subject to this report right here i mean as the environment changes then we

can you know that we can adapt and respond appropriately yes sir so good i would like to be ready to respond rather than somebody come up and saying you did not do it well that that is hopefully what we are getting in front of we have addressed this we have addressed sp sp7 and any new federal state

local compliance that we need to address as part of the internal audit plan we can adapt and nimbly change that internal audit plan to respond to any of those changes thank you any other questions yeah miss n i want to thank mr graves based in austin came out and he and his team did a great job of

ensuring that the college is in compliance with sb7 as it currently stands we are obviously in a legislative session currently there is lots of bills that are being proposed nothing has passed yet but as of as of today we are in compliance with s sp7 certainly want to appreciate want to thank mr graves and his team for

the extensive audit that they did with our team as much item one seven two mr keith erikson of the northeast rotary club will make a presentation to the board of trustees regarding the flags for heroes at the trans mountain flags for heroes at the trans mountain campus good afternoon how you all doing today thank you great thank

to move on to retirement tonight we are going to be honoring olga la lazarin broom tonight we recognize and celebrate the incredible career of olga la lazarin broom who is retired from el paso community college after nearly 30 years of dedic ated service her journey with epcc began in 1995 as a work study student through her unwavering

passion for higher education and commitment to student success she grew into a vital member of our community eventually becoming a full-time admissions and registration assistant for the inter international student office over the years she has played an instrumental role in guiding students from diverse backgrounds through the admissions and visa processes helping them achieve their academic dreams her

impact extends far beyond the office olga has been an integral part of the admissions and registration team representing epcc at apply texas intake sessions tacro conferences and operation college bound as well as serving on numerous college committees her deep belief in the power of education is evident in the practice compassion and care she brings to her work

in fact epcc was an essential part of her own educational journey with the support of the college she earned an associate of arts and criminal justice before going on to complete her bachelor's degree in the same field her colleagues will miss her tremendously she has always gone the extra mile ensuring that every student and staff member received

the best possible support if she did not have an answer she would find it her commitment to excellence and willingness to help others have left the lasting mark on epcc as she embarks on this new chapter she looks forward to spending more time with her children and grandchildren but her passion for learning does does not stop here

she is already enrolled at new mexico state university to pursue her master's degree in social work miss ladin broom your dedication and hard work have made a profound impact on this college and the many lives that you have touched we are deeply grateful for your service and while we will miss you we celebrate this exciting next step

good evening members of the board dr sarata vice presidents faculty and staff and honor guest my name is luis gonzalez and i am truly honored to be here today as a member of the student government association and new student orientation i was privileged to represent apcc at the texas capital at austin and i want to take a

moment to thank you all for making this an incredible experience possible i would like to express my gratitude to the once again board of trustees dr sarata apcc leadership the apcc new orientation team and everyone who worked behind the scenes to make this opportunity possible i special thank you to staffer sophia garcia from senator husman's office who

took the time to meet with us and talk a little bit of how us students can be involved into the political process one thing she said that really stuck with me was that we as students have the power to accomplish anything hearing that from someone who working directly in the heart of our state government made me realize

that the only limits we face are the ones we accept if we step up speak out and take action we are capable of creating a action we are capable of creating a lasting change however this despite the inspiration and opportunities for representation i also faced a moment of harsh reality when walking to the streets of austin with

my peers we encountered an act of racism from a homeless individual this moment made me realize that despite the progress in many ways human society has bias will exist and will continue to exist even though i it will be a moment to define my trip as something bad i took this as a learning opportunity and reason to

continue raising my voice and advocating for my rights coming back from austin i am more driven than ever i saw firstand the impact that community colleges have in shaping lives and how important it is for students like us to be involved in for students like us to be involved in the conversation i also learned that adversity will

always be present but what matters is how we respond to it and i choose to respond with strength knowledge and action once again thank you for giving me this opportunity thank you for investing in students and believing our boys deserve to be heard this trip changed my life and i hope that my experience can serve as a

testament why sur pring community colleges is not just an investment in education but an investment in a better more just society thank you and go thank you and go hanos good evening dr serata and members of the board i am isak diaz palma i am vice president of epcc sgaa and this evening i would like to take

a moment to share some of the insights that we gained during our recent trip to austin for community college day but before i do i want to extend our sing gratitude to dr serata members of the board as well as to miss rivas dr amaya miss olivas miss sanchez and everyone who play a role in making this

race possible one of the main themes for our tree was advocacy which we understand as public support for a cause or policy advocacy is vital because it allow us to represent our community's interests and stand out for what matters the most throughout this experience we learned that advocacy can succeed when we put enough effort and more importantly

when we come together as a collective force to pursue our goals i was truly inspired by walking through the capital aisles and getting to know how government works one memorable moment for me occ when i was in dr gonzalez office speaking with her staff one of her staff members told me not to lose hope even in the

current challenging political climate as long as we continue to speak and stand out for what we believe in we will find a path forward it was at that moment that i truly realized the importance of our work every draft every training session every meeting and every bit of preparation had led us to this meaningful opportunity to advocate

for our ca now that we are back in el paso i believe that our next responsibility is to share the knowledge we have gained with our fellow s members as well as with our friends and family this way the information we learn does not stay just with us but instead it spreads out to our community i remember

when dr amaya was telling us when we were leaving the capital building that it is now up to us to pass on what we learn so that future generations and everyone in our network will be better equipped to make a difference once again thank you for this incredible opportunity we are excited to continue participating in events like

this so that we can keep learning and contributing to a brighter future not only for ourselves but for our entire you thank you all for representing us in austin for community college days b can you make sure you reflect that judge hagerty is here he got here when they were presenting and he'll be taking over from here

yes ma'am thank you bnie come on up there the best speech of the whole i made it just in time i missed you mr hagerty where were you gee i do not have to answer that i do not have to answer that wow greetings trustees mr president vice presidents deans guests in person and in the vastness of

cyers space two years ago the dominant political party in texas attempted to eliminate tenure in texas public colleges and universities fortunately that effort failed two years later in the present day that political party is once again advocating the elimination of tenure as i did back in 2023 i quote the great american patriot thomas payne when i say

these are the times that try men's souls the official party platform of that dominant political party states in that dominant political party states in paragraph 108 we support abolishing the system of tenure in academia and advocate ate replacing it with a merit-based system for teacher retention of course this political party would be the one to write the

rules for retention and those rules would undoubtedly state their particular propaganda in addition texas state representative matthew shaban a member of the dominant political party has introduced hb1 1830 which states an institution of higher education may not grant an employee of the institution tenure or any type of permanent employment status here we go again folks that same

dominant political party is for the second legislative session in a row seeking to deprive us of our livelihood but this should come as no surprise as the same political party at the national level has already deprived thousands of federal government workers of their livelihood and a most capricious vengeful and uncaring attitude to paraphrase the great thomas jefferson

and the declaration of independence that particular political independence that particular political party whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people thank you anybody else section one eight communications item one eight one discussion and review regarding data statistics policies and general information rel related

to aeso community college by the board of trustees chair hagerty and members of the board i invite dr andrea wolf to come up and provide the board with an update on our 2025 quality please hi first of all thank you so much for this opportunity to talk to you about our quality enhancement plan otherwise known as the

q as dr sra mentioned i am dr andre wolf and i am the director of qep and assessment here at al paso community college and today i am going to talk just a little bit about what is our q as well as some of far okay so first you should know that our q is part of our

accreditation process it is required to address either student learning or student success there are two requirements for the topic one it must be data driven and it must be selected through a process involving all institutional stakeholders for us in our process a couple years ago we had a qep topic selection task force that had a lot of

institutional stakeholders they looked at the data we had two institutional wide surveys we then also had a qp town hall afterwards once we had our topic we then had a qep development task force with more stakeholders to come up with our interventions so let me tell you a little bit about the cycle it takes five years to

develop a plan this plan is then reviewed by sac crc and they give us our recommendations or suggestions at that point we have five years to implement our plan then we turn in a five-year report to sac crc we are now in our third year of implementation so our qp is find your way connect discover succeed our

focus is to improve student success our primary goal is that students take ownership of their academic and career paths and our primary assessment is the decrease of the average semester credit hours for our graduates now we have three sets of in interventions the first set has to do with communication so we are talking about communicating with students

both about programs events as well as the colleg goinging culture so first we have a start here epcc start here video you may have some of you on the board may have mention seen it a couple years ago it is both in english and spanish i know she is not here but thank you to dr graham for

that suggestion of having it in spanish it covers expectations such as you are supposed to go to new student orientation nso you are supposed to visit your first year experience adviser and do something called an educational plan and i will tell you about that what that is in just a moment we also have requests to promote forms

now the idea here is that we have this hub my pcc edu that has announcements and upcoming events and we want that to be a main communication hub for our students so in order to encourage ownership of this site from our faculty and staff we have asked them to do complete requests to promote forms whenever they have

an event in this way the sites populate with all of our events and they are telling other students hey this is the place to go and this has really is the place to go and this has really been successful also new student orientation had a little bit of a boost we gave ten interns for new student orientation

these interns were incredibly important because they did a lot of the community outreach to students new students to come furthermore this became a place that we can give really important information so for example we had students on our task force as well as on our in in the town hall who mentioned that they did not even know

they were supposed to do epcc email the first couple of months they were here and so we knew there was something that we need to address at nso we have computers and one of the things they absolutely the interns do is that once they come in they say hey have you entered your epcc email yet have you

logged in would you like help and they do that in the beginning at breaks and at the end and of course we assess that as well forther this is a place they learn about degree works this is the program that students can digitally look at their degree plan and they can also play around with it a little

bit like hey what happens if i decide to change my major how many more classes would i have to take it is a great tool and finally again they hear about first year experience advisers and to do those year experience advisers and to do those educational plans now there is another part of our cp and that has

to do with the faculty we invited all the disciplines to do one of three interventions one is a career day event and you will see the two pictures there are from previous career day events these are very big events that address hundreds of students they are a big deal it take a lot it takes a lot to

host them but they put in the work and effort and the idea is that we have people from the community that come in and talk about careers as from in the community as well as say what kind of career can you get with a philosophy degree with a criminal justice degree these are great events that students really

have a lot of take a lot of value in the carew reflection assignment so we have two different types of assign assignments a career reflection assignment and an assignment using degree works that program we talked about that digitally looks at those degree plans so these run the gamut these are not one set assignments these assignments are owned

by faculty and disciplines and they run the gamut from doing journal entries to doing reflection homework assignments posters projects they they have really taken ownership of this project and it is throughout all of the all of the different ah lost by tr thought all the different disciplines that are implementing those okay finally we get to the educational

plans yay all right so the educational plans are different than degree plans in a really important way a degree plan is a list of required preset courses in each program of study whereas an education plan is a step-by-step roap that can be customized toward students individual needs this means as they meet with the students the first year

experience advisors meet with them twice in the fall twice in the spring they have these conversations and it talks more about not just here's your degree plan but the challenges they may have the changes in their lives that might happen they are also these fy advisers become an important bridge to all the different resources we have hey

you are having a problem figuring out this is the right career for you go to career and transfer services you need to work full-time instead of part-time hey maybe you can look at some of the scholarship opportunities we have you are having some trouble with one of these courses that you need to pass to move forward did

you know about our tutoring so they become a great bridge for that so and they hear about the expectation for doing these education plans remember it is kind of stacked they hear it from that video they hear it at nso they get an invite through email which is why it is so important they enter that email and

then they also hear it from faculty and other counselors okay so the data this is some of the data because we have a lot of data but the data in general really shows positive all the way through so here is a screenshot from our start here video we started with one 349 clicks in 2022 we this past

year it is done by january to january one 864 combined clicks and so we are moving up the request remote forms are also moving up from 93 in the academic year of 2022 2023 to 154 this last past academic year and i just recently talked to jim heiney who said that we are already past that number and

we are only in february new st orientation has some of the best data so we are up to this they do it by season of summer so this is season 2024 just last summer three 197 participants which represent 80 of our ftic that is the best we have ever had that is up from 2766 which is 65

of fts back in 2023 so we assess every single part this is from an exit survey so 83 respondents from that survey logged into their email 95 said they were confident using degree works coming out of nso and 93 respondents planned to meet with their fy adviser all good stuff career day events since 2022 we have had

62 career events which is incredible that served four 419 students we have had 30 different disciplines participate 98 of the again we do an exit survey for this as well 98 of the respondents reported that the events were good use of their time and 96 talked about how the information was valuable to them so clearly students are

these experiences are important for their for experiences are important for their for our students so our total completed surveys for career reflection assignment and the assignment using degree works is three 75 that is our number that they completed the survey but obviously it is only a fraction of the number of those who actually did the assignments we

also from these 80 said that their career reflection assignment was useful to them even though 40 one previously did a similar assignment that was one of our concerns hey if they are doing reflection over here and reflection over here would not that become roote but this this inter intervention was grounded in the research that students needed to

have repetition it was not enough to have one class where they talked about p reflection and then did not do it ever again so this actual data supports that as well and also the assignments using degree works 87 said that the assignment was useful to them even though almost 50 had used degree works before they still found

value in these assignments and finally our first year experience we went up from one 022 which is 24 of f tixs in 2022 2023 to one 200 which is 30 of ftic we cannot wait to see that number grow and finally our average semester credit hours we noticed a nice downward turn 78 to 75 to 74 a

small caveat i would mention that the qp only started two years ago so it is unlikely that the q had a huge impact on these particular numbers and far more likely we have other interventions here at epcc that affected these numbers but i would say that student success is everyone's business here at el paso community college and

so we should all be proud about these numbers any you section one nine board of trustees business item one nine one discussion and take action to authorize the president or his design to execute a limited license agreement between the college and rotary international district 5520 regarding the installation of certain american flag displays on the trans mountain campus

what can we do to assist you what can we do to help you persist and graduate so what they said was it'd be great if there was a center a student parent resource center that we know was for us that we could get the help we needed we als also would like lactation rooms at each campus they

also said it'd be great if the college had more familyfriendly practices including course scheduling and two generation event programming and it'd be great if we could get referrals to college and community resources and services so by 2023 we open up the student parent resource centers at every campus we open lactation rooms at every campus we now have
