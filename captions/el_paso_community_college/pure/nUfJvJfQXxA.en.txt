assistant hello good afternoon so this is my first board meeting i have ever attended but i wanted to have a few comments for you guys so i have i have found out from people that they are saying new degree coming out it is called occupational assistant degree to give a quick background about me i graduated from high

school two years ago i right away went into pcc on trent fountain and went in while fire i am st a student right now and i heard of a new degree year called occupational assistant but a few people have been telling me that it did not get approved or it is keeps getting delayed and i' i have

been sure i have been wanting to be a occupational therapy assistant from high school before high school i graduated top ten of my class in high school so i am right now i am currently doing my basics still at epcc as a matter of fact i have class night so when i was in high school i suffered

some trauma that made me want to become a occupational therapist i know a few people from umc who were my therapists and they all support me on this and but my i am almost done with my basics but my point is that i need that degree approved as soon as possible but someone told me that it was

getting delayed so i really hope to ask you guys if we could keep working to get that degree out as soon as possible for me cuz i am like i said i am done with my basics this year this year but i am kind of guessing what the occupational degree would include and my goal for today was

to hopefully get an answer from one of you guys about an update on this new degree i know that nobody really knows no one should know of the degree i am talking about but i found out and i am hoping to get an answer from any one of you today about an update regarding this thank you for

to congratulate you and everything else that excuse me but i want to i made a point sort of in conversation there and i'd like to get it on record again i am a professional engineer i am a registered engineer i made my living as an engineer i ran an engineering company and i am a published engineer and

i want to say that all with respect because i found that a lot of what i have is something i'd like to see incorporated in this program officially we can talk about engineering and those things but i would like to see a actual requirement for public presentation and for written communication because as an engineer in a in

a strict sense as an engineer that helps you get ahead you but i think in a larger sense the ability to communicate with others is important to be able to get along and i just happen to noticed tonight excuse me that in the larger sense this idea of communication we had an a good example in there and

i know this young man that just talked to us i and i apologize for not remembering your name but as i was thinking about i watched him and i think he got up here and he exemplified real courage okay this something you need to do if you are talking about a group that you are not familiar with

he did the important thing he had courage to get up there he identified a problem he identified the presence the importance of the problem the need for the problem his interest in the problem and a request for action okay and that is what get things done he is a perfect example he needs to be congratulated for getting

up and speaking about it but that is what we need and that is what in now back at the need and that is what in now back at the engineering academy you can you can i i am here to tell you can do the books and do the equations all you want to but if you cannot get

provide on-site food services on a concession basis at the northwest campus and rio grande campus respectfully move and rio grande campus respectfully move to approve mr mes second it second yeah sorry second any discussion yes sir okay i look at and we actually have in our notes on page 102 we have the results of the scoring at

looking for taco family doing businesses tuer i am did not pronounce it right and then for the second one and so i have some questions about i am not sure who attended that but i look on this the first scoring thing when we looked at food services northwest campus we have there was based on 100 point points

and so for the reputation of the vendor out of possible ten points there was eight points awarded i wonder you know is there a question with reputation item three the quality of that 25 points and it only got twenty points is there a question about the quality do we do not have adequate quality no this page 102

dr s okay and then pay and then item four the extent which the good and services meet the 35 points and it was awarded 29 six points less is there a question about that we go then to the real g campus and we had that 100 points qualified and we selected somebody that scored only 71 nine five

points i in a classroom 70 points is your c not so great class you know i mean i realize that this is the only people we got only thing but you know 70 points to supply food services again the reputation in this case the reputation for the taco family was six whereas a reputation for the taco family

at the northwest campus is eight four is there a difference in their reputation as to where they are going to to do that it is the same number of points but did the reputation rise or fall depending on the campus the quality of the store seventeen five points versus twenty points again do they serve better quality at

one campus and the other i do not understand that and the extent to which they can do the goods and services those are nominally the same but i do not understand i do not understand why that we are at number one i do not understand why we are accepting something at 71 if this is the only one

there do we then even want to offer food services number one yeah we do i mean i am the one very much interested in food secur insecurity but we do not want food inadequacy okay and i do not understand why we are 71 points is there something we do to work with the people or we can do

something else get better and then why are we looking at what i consider on a classroom scale that now i understand that but and i understand there is really no comparability other than we see the local food service in the city goes through and once a quarter they go and evaluate all the restaurants and we look if

anybody has less than 90 95 points you know you do not think you are going to take your family there to eat a hamburger or something here we are looking at said okay 80 points or 71 i do not know and i know that the point considerations are totally different they are not comparable we are not even

apples no we are not fruits and anything el but i tell you what i do not understand why we are somebody that is quality i mean the reputation is not there the quality is different it varies between location what what is happened do we have the same group or is there why is there difference and should we

be accepting stuff like this or should we be trying to work with people to provide if this if something better if we are going to provide and see that our students would get food services do not we want you know good stuff i mean i am not saying this is not good but i do not know it

seemed like that there is room for growth mr uxer those are really good questions and they are quantitative based upon two different committees each location had was comprised of a dean a for that campus a student government representative for that campus and then consisted of the director of auxiliary services mr juan flores and then avp of budget

financial services miss anik so there were two different committees responding to your question on the reputation where one received an eight another one received a six you have different committees that were scoring that were ultim ly averaged into a composite score for location as far as the grading the 70 these two vendors have been providing us already

their known quantities their known quantities to us they are providing his services at other campuses and we know their service so the quality of their services has been good mr exer so they are good but they do not get the numbers based upon the submission of the documentation that they provided the committee reacted to the materials that

were placed in front of them and compared them to the nine criteria that we follow to evaluate and so the committee's interpretation of the document that each each vendor provided their menu and how the venue and the menu met the needs of that of that campus were interpreted by the committee and individually graded and resulted in individually

graded and resulted in the scoring i guess if i were to receive these two occupants and then just looking at the first one the one that is common between both we had two different committees that had i will choose one particular deal the the reputation and the quality and it is a different value but then i would

actually want both groups to get together and say hey how come y'all evaluate the differently is did one knows something better than the other yeah i real individual just because that is a committee we got to take their word and that is nothing i think i would have chased that down to find out why one has less

and if they are supplying good good quality and doing really good at other locations is 71 as a total score else no those are those are good comments and hard to answer the rules that we follow or prescribed by the purchasing area where we do not co-mingle committees from different campuses so we try to honor the integrity

of the process is there is there part of the rules say that the committees after they are through they cannot get together and at least talk as to why they could not come up do you have rulle saying you cannot ever talk to anybody else and find out what else they may know that i do not know

the rule says you cannot do that i would have to defer to mr gallardo about the rules or person so mr xer one thing to keep in mind is that these are two different proposals submitted by the same vendor for two separate procurement processes with different titles one the real grand campus that were looking for a coffee

and a pastry location and the northwest campus was looking for a full eery so it is different needs different proposals different submittal like looking at two resum s for the same candidate the rum is being tailored by that candidate for a particular so the quality of that organization will depend on what service they can provide yes so

if they were if they'd have a better quality if you wanted to from just to sandwiches to that and something their quality then changes with something else yes sir okay and these are rules who makes up those rules so these are not rules if we are looking for an orange and an apple submits then they are not

going to be that apple is not going to be as qualified as the orange right okay so you know i understand and we go that it just seems to me that we have these evaluations and frankly i would i am not impressed on buying somebody doing whatever it is for somebody that is ad if they have been

there for a while and they have done good to get an 80 i mean we all work on k12 type thing 80 is just you just got to be you know and we want a food service we want a we want a level of services so to give you a little perspective on that for the real grand

campus i think that is the one where the 71 score came to play this is our fourth attempt at getting a an eery for that campus so we are willing to accept something we are we do not have to accept it if the does not want to okay and we can go out a fifth time but i

am thinking we may i realize this is the only one and you know and i have been privy to this and we have been cha you and i and some of the other have been chasing this since i first went to northwest campus almost ten years ago and we are not you know when k left we sort

of got you know we haven't been up to k's level i am sorry we have t here but we haven't been up to k's level since then it is a difficult challenge yes sir especially for the business providing the services to keep a profitable okay then what are we going to do to do better to get something

better than 70 i mean we can accept this and go ahead i am sorry i t time but we can accept this but let let us see if we cannot do better for the kids we made multiple phone calls to businesses out of the purchasing department hoping that one of them would submit a proposal as a matter

of fact i think our camp also reached out to people they know from around that campus at real grand and like i said this is our fourth rfp what what is what would be the response to the question how can we improve the rfp request to get better performance we pay the vendor to be on campus oh

okay that be sounds like a winner we can get the money right now they pay us well we can pay them we can we go there is a bunch of bunch of money floating in washington dc right who is who where's sir roy h have her write another grant request for that she is good at that okay

i am sorry it just seems to me that the numbers just do not reflect them doing good jobs elsewhere as far as taco families concerned it and i may be speaking out of turn but i believe that dr tenna who is the dean of that campus is very happy with her service is she go wait a minute

wait a minute you took me around almost ten years ago and if we have a problem on that campus how come you haven't called me how come it is not as good as k how come you haven't called me and told me that we you know i i am the one that is my school you need to

call me and say hey we need to do something except wait until i get one of these things for him thank you sir for the clarification call that question please on can i oh i am sorry just for clarification this eval these evaluations are based on the proposal documentation that they put in right not somebody actually going

and trying the product and going and saying what is the service like what is the food like this is based on what somebody wrote somebody's proposal these evaluations are based on that correct yes ma'am thank you yes and that explanation is also found on the agenda book call the question please mr xer hi mrs ress hi miss

naha hi mr mendes hi dr graham hi section five physical facilities there is none section six curriculum and instruction item six one discussion and action on the approval of the revised new credit program certificate in social move to approve do we have a second thank discussion mr smith can you give us a little bit of background on

what that is going to entail it sounds exciting absolutely dr graham first of all i want to mention at the bottom of the agenda item you will see that the board had actually approved this program as a level one certificate some meetings back we are presenting it now because we realized that one of the courses in the

program requires students to pass the tsi pushing it into a level two certificate so we are bringing this back just to clarify with the board that the approval is for a level two certificate but as most folks in the audience are probably aware social media is a huge burgeoning industry and we are getting number requests for companies

that need social media experts out whether it is podcasting whether it is a web presence on instagram or facebook or x students will be trained to facilitate those sorts of things for programs and businesses so is there going to be two levels or it is only one l it is just one dr graham it is a level

two certificate a certificate so there is not like a pre class okay thank you sir mh mr xer i mrs robless hi miss naha i mr mendes hi dr graham i item six two discussion and action on the approval of a new academic program in polysomnography sleep study tech in the any discussion call the question mr xer

foundation in the amount of 63 five 75 item six eight discussion and action on the acceptance of a grant award from the texas workforce commission twc in the amount of 31 500 item six nine discussion and action on the acceptance of a grand award from the math circle network of the american institute of mathematics aim in the

amount of eleven zero dr graham and members of the board i'd asked dr smith to weigh in on these grants as you see appropriate obviously carl perkins is one that we receive on a regular basis but a lot of work went into it as well yeah first of all of course i want to thank the grants office

for all of the assistance that they do for all of these grants carl perkins of course is one of our largest grants that is geared to serve cte students and so we are grateful for the state to funnel that money to us it is based on the headcount of cte students that we have at the institution and

you will see higher than the previous yes as we see increased student enrollment in cte programs that amount increases increased and you see several vps identified as resource persons on there so we actually have those funds dispersed not only in instruction but also in institutional research and student services as well to facilitate the success of those students

so thanks to those folks for chiming in the james buddy d foundation let me ask dean joshua vi alobos to stand up and be recognized i will not venture to guess how many years in a row we have gotten this but it started when he was a geology faculty member and has continued to this day so thank

you dean vos for putting that together for us and then i want to thank miss fan chen for the math circle grant that she is got for those of you that may know professor chen she is a force to be reckoned with in the math area if you subscribe to her ex- channel you will see she is

having tutoring sessions on the weekends and the evenings at the public schools in libraries she is all over the place so we want to thank her for her efforts around there she is not here this evening and then let us see which one mr reer you caught me off guard by approving all of them at the same

time of course i would like to recognize mr primit mr blain primit associate vice president of workforce and continuing education for the skills for small businesses those of you that do not know mr primich as a dean at the viver campus started collecting child care grants and continues to this say we know that is an incredibly important

need in our community and for our students well in that light it was to the us department of labor for 160 and the james a buddy foundation if you want to comment on those yeah the buddy foundation one was the one for dean vi aobos which we recognized and then the department of labor department of labor grant

the susan harwood grant that is another one that we have had for many years it is centered around risk management and safety in the workplace and so as you may know we also receive a large amount of money for the risk management institute from texas mutual and so those two grants taken together let us do great things

for risk management and safety in the region thank you dr smith thank you sir and please convey our gratitude to all that contributed time and effort to getting this funds and getting these programs going we do thank you dr good job it is a lot of money mr exer hi mrs roess hi miss naha hi mr mendes
