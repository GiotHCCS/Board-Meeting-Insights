00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
&gt;&gt;:  Good morning, everyone.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
  Thank you for being here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
  Before we start this meeting, 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I just want to make sure if you 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
weren't here earlier in our 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
budget workshop meeting, chair 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Sullivan is here, but he had to 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
step out real quick to attend a 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
work matter.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
  So he asked me to take his 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
place for a while.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
  So if you see him step back in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and me getting -- you know, 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
switching seats, you know why.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
  Thank you.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
  Thank you for your patience.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
  Good morning again, this is a 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
regular meeting of the Lone Star 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
College system Board of Trustees.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
  It's now come the order at 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
10:30 a.m.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
  If you could please stand with 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
me for the pledge of allegiance.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I pledge allegiance to the flag 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of the United States of America.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
  And to the republic for which 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
it stands, one nation, under 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
God, indivisible, with liberty 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and justice for all.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm going to do a roll call real 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
quick just to make sure that we 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
do have quorum, which we do.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
  But I'll start with trustee 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Wilson?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
&gt;&gt;:  Here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
&gt;&gt;:  Trustee Broussard?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
  Trustee Stoma?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
  Trustee Meza?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
  Trustee Murillo?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
  Trustee Vogt?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
  Trustee Cain?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
&gt;&gt;:  Here.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
&gt;&gt;:  And myself.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
  Perfect.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
  Thank you.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
  Chancellor Castillo, has the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
notice of this meeting been 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
posted?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, madam chair.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
  I certify that the posting has 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
been done so in accordance with 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the law.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you, sir.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
  Next slide is public comment.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
  Do we have anyone signed up 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
for public comment?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, we have one public 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
speaker, Dr.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 John Bergdof.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
&gt;&gt;:  Hello.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
  Good morning.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
&gt;&gt;:  Good morning.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
  Good morning,  everyone.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
  I am Dr.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 John Bergdof, president of the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
American federation of teachers 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
at Lone Star College.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
  In September of 2005, the most 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
powerful hurricane ever recorded 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
in the gulf of Mexico was taking 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
a direct path towards  Houston.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
  Hurricane Rita intensified to 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
category five with top winds of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 177 miles per hour and she was 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
headed straight towards 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Galveston bay.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
  Although she veered away from 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Houston at the last hour, the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
effects in the golden triangle 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
were devastating.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
  Between rain and astronomical

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 storm surge, Rita was bad.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
  As bad as Rita was for folks 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
east of us, the worst problem 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
for Houston was we overreacted.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
  Tens of thousands of people 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
took to the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 freeways, brings I-45 to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 a standstill all the way to 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Dallas.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
  Why am I recalling this sad 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
story  today?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
  Since the start of the year, 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
higher education has been 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
experiencing a category five 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
hurricane in the form of 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
government actions.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
  There are many specific 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
examples I could bring up, but 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
today I want to recall three.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
  The lawsuit from the Trump 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Department of Justice ending 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
instate tuition for undocumented 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
students.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
  Senate bill 37 shuttering

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 faculty Senate and creating a 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
new bureaucracy in  Austin.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
  And Senate bill 2615 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
restricting remote work for 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
higher education employees.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
  All of these action and others 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
are very bad for Lone Star 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
College, for our students, and 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
for our employees.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 my biggest fear is that the 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
effect can be made worse if our 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
people overreact.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
  The indistrict ruling, for 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
example, does not apply to 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
foreign students on F

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
1 visas or students with valid 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
work permits.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
  DACA students and foreign 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
students with visas as well as 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
several other categories of 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
students are still eligible for

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 indistrict tuition if they meet 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
indistrict requirements.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
  I absolutely understand the 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
threat that many of these 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
students feel but they don't 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
need to make decisions based on 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
incorrect information about 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
tuition, potentially making 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
their future prospects even 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
worse.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
  SB37 in early drafts included 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
restrictions on the content that 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
faculty teachment these 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
provisions were stripped out 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
before the bill passed.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
  I've been getting calls from 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
faculty asking if they should 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
quit teaching about unpopular 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
topics, like slavery or 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
segregation or from showing 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
pictures of renaissance art or

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
.  I assure them that they

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 do not have to do so and, in 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
fact, they should not back away 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
from the important information 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
they teach.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
  However I worry that others 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
will silently overcomply with 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
what they think the law as a

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 says and deprive students of 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
the education they need.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
  SB2615 puts limits on remote 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
work for higher education 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
employees but does not end it.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
  Lone Star's flexible work 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
program which allows for some 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
days working from home and

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 includes accountability 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
measures should largely pass 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
muster, at least for nonteaching 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
staff.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
  Some alterations may be 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
necessary but pulling back on 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
the program would be a needless 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
overreaction.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Rita may have been less deadly 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
for Houstonians if public 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
officials had given out clearer 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
guidance.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
  I believe working together, 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
you on the board, the 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
administration, the union and 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
other interested groups, can 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
send out the best possible 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
information so that Lone Star 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
follows the law but our people 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
don't needlessly hurt our 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
students and ourselves by 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
overreacting.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
  Thank you so much for your 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
kind attention.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you, sir.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Ms.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Barnet, do we have anyone else 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
signed up for public comment?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
&gt;&gt;:  We do not.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
&gt;&gt;:  No?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
  Okay.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
  Since we have no other 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
speakers, we'll move on to the 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
approval of the minutes.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
  So colleagues, if you had the 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
opportunity to review the 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
minutes, it's now time to 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
approve them.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
  So approve the minutes of the 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
June 5th, 2025 budget workshop 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
meeting and the June 5th 2025 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
regular meeting.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
  Are there any corrections to 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
the meeting, if you were able to 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
review them ahead of time?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
  If no corrections, do I hear a 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
motion the approve the minutes?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
  Do I hear a second?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
&gt;&gt;:  Second.&gt;&gt;:  Okay.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
  There's a motion and a second.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
  Can I hear any ayes or yes

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
?&gt;&gt;:  Yes.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
&gt;&gt;:  Okay.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
  And any nays?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
  All right.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
  The motion passes.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
  Thank you.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Next slide is special

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 reports and announcements.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
  Chancellor?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, thank you, madam chair.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
  Let's start with the events.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
  So I want to start by 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
highlighting Dr.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Vienne was recently  

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
recognized, I think it was about 

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
a week ago, on July 23rd by the 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Houston business journal for the 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
best CFOs in the greater Houston 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
area.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
  And it was a great event.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
  And I know several board 

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
members were there, so we look 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
forward to your comments on that.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
  We had three tables there, 

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
actually.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
  It was really nice.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
  Your colleagues were there, a 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
lot of your team members were 

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
there.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
  It was a really nice and it 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
was also a big deal because it 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
was the inaugural one.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
  So I wanted to publicly 

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
recognize Dr.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Vienne  again.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
  When one of our employees 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
wins, we all win.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
  So we're very proud of you.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Would you like to say a few 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
words,  Dr.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Vienne?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
  Reenact your speech from that 

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
day?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
  No?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
  Okay.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
  All right.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
  All right, ma'am.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
  Fall 2025 convocation is on 

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
August 19th from 8:30 to 11:30 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
at the Woodlands water way 

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Marriott.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
  And we're going to do things a 

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
little bit differently this year.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
  If you've been there this year 

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and you're, like, been there, 

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
done that, it's a new show.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
  We'll see what the ratings say.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
  But we're going to at least 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
try something new.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
  It is optional.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
  I want to be very clear about 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
  I don't want anyone

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
  convocating against their will.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
The start of the term is on  

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
August 25th and so we're going 

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
to start the fall term, and then 

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
now I want to move to sort of 

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
really the main point that I 

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
wanted to make today.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
  And I'm going to start first, 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
we're going to talk about this 

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
later with regards to the action 

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
item number 28, but we have a 

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
representative from -- that 

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
represents Apple in the audience 

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and I want to recognize him.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
   Mr.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 Collins is back there.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
  Yes.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
  And we're forming a 

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
partnership with (inaudible) and 

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
indirectly with a Apple to as 

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
you guys have probably read as 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
recently as yesterday, there is 

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
an announcement that we're going 

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
to have several millions of 

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
dollars of investment coming 

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
right here to our fall brook 

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
area in North Harris county.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
  And one of the things that 

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I've asked our hopefully new 

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
partners and fox con and Apple, 

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
NVIDIA and Samsung and those 

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
folks is all we ask in return is 

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
that you hire our students.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
  That's really sort of the only 

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
thing that we have to ask of you.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
  We want to be good neighbors.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
  We want to be good  partners.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
  But we would like for you the 

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
offer one of those -- most of 

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
those 2500 new jobs to our 

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
students here at Lone Star.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
  And so part of what I told 

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
you, Mr.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Collins, is that at this 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
institution, we believe in the 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
work product that we put out.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
  And I wouldn't ask Apple or 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
fox con or anyone else to hire 

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
our students if I'm not willing 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
to do it myself.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
  And so I want to recognize we 

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
have five students right now 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that work in the Chancellor's 

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Office and I'm going to go one 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
by one with them and ask them to 

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
stand and just talk a little bit 

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
about them.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
  I promised them that they 

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
would not have to come and give 

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
speeches.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
  So let's start with Marie H.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
  Marie is originally from

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Cameroon and a proud first 

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
generation college student 

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
studying abroad.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
  Planning to graduate by 2029.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
  She aims to build a career 

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
protecting systems and 

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
communities from digital threats.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
  She enjoys modeling, spending 

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
time with loved ones, and time 

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
coding.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000
  So there you go, Apple.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
(inaudible) moved from Angola to 

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
the United States in 2024 and 

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
began studies at Lone Star that 

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
fall.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
  He's pursuing engineering -- I 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
get nervous too, believe it or 

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
not -- he's pursuing an 

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
engineering degree with plans to 

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
transfer to A&amp;M.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
  And you're expecting to 

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
graduate in 2026.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
  You aspire to work in the 

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
offshore oil industry and travel 

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the world.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
  You enjoy researching global 

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and environmental topics online 

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and playing video games.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
  What type of flicking no, I'm 

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
just kidding.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
  I promised no one would have 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
the speak.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
  Thank you so much.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
So Jenny is from Vietnam

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 and she moved to the United 

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000

  She's pursuing an associate of 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000

  She plans to transfer to the 

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
University of Houston and 

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
graduate in 2028.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
  She has a focus on human 

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
resources and organizational 

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
development.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:30.000
  So thank you.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Brianna earned both a

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 high school diploma and an 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
  She has a molecular biology 

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
concentration, I can barely 

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
pronounce that, so 

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
congratulations.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
  You're graduating in December 

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
  She aims to become a child 

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000

children's children and families 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
in hospital settings.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
  She is actively involved in 

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
volunteering in hospitals and 

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
church leadership.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
  Thank you.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Richard, last but not least is 

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
from Canada with a background as 

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
a full stack software engineer

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
.  He aspires to start a 

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
software business and sees the 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
degree as a stepping stone 

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
toward entrepreneurial roles.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
  He enjoys coding and video 

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
games in free time.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
  Thank you, Richard.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And so the my friends at Apple, 

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I practice what I preach, and I 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
expect my partners to do the 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
same.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Next but not least, I want to 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
introduce new president of the 

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
LSC online.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
  Come on down, Dr.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Morales.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
  So let me tell you a little 

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
bit about Dr.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Morales because he tends to be 

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
very humble and I like to brag.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
  He's the founding president of 

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
TCC connect, which is in Tarrant 

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
county, which serves over 30,000 

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
students.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
  She began her career in public 

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000

  She's been at Lone Star since

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
  She holds a doctor of higher 

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000

been the interim for the last 

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
eight months.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
  So we just knocked off the

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 interim.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
  Dr.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Prince is this.

&gt;&gt;:  Thank you.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
  Good morning, madam vice chair

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
, chancellor Castillo, and the 

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
rest of the faculty and staff 

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
who are here.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
  It's truly an honor and 

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
privilege to be intrusted with 

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
this role.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
  It's very exciting to work at 

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
a place like Lone Star College 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
system where everyone from the 

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
board to the chancellor to the 

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
leadership team works together 

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
collaboratively to really be 

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
able to transform the lives of 

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
our students, their families, 

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and our communities.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
  And it was very easy for me to 

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
say yes to being in a role where 

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I get to work with all of this 

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
team.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
  It's so rewarding to be a part 

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
of this, and I'm excited for the 

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
work ahead and grateful for the 

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
opportunity.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
  Thank you very much.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
&gt;&gt;:  All right.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
  And the last  introduction, I 

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
promise, is our new associate

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 vice chancellor of

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 mental health and wellness.  Dr.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Stokes, come on down.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
  She's the associate vice 

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
chancellor in that position.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
  She has 27 years of clinical 

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
experience and nearly 20 years 

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
in college mentality leadership.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
  She's known for her innovative 

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
approach to mental health, 

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
aligning with Lone Star 

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
College's mission.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
  She led key wellness

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 initiatives with the Judd 

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
foundation.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
  Her background includes work

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 in psychiatric settings.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
  She is a proud mother of three 

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
daughters.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
  And so I really want to 

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
highlight this part of it.  Dr.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Stokes is a clinician.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
  Right?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
  And so she's a mental health 

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
doctor.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
  And she has been hired to lead 

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
what we hope to be our new 

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
internal mental health division 

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
for our students and our

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 employees.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you to the vice 

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
chair, chancellor, and to the 

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
board members.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
  I am thrilled to be here.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
  I have had such a warm welcome 

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
from so many of you.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
  I've been able to meet with 

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
people from all levels of 

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
leadership, as well as our 

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
frontline staff.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
  I was sharing with Dr.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Vienne that as soon as I think 

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I know how big Lone Star S it 

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
gets bigger.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
  And then it gets bigger.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
  And so I'm still trying to 

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
wrap my head around the 

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
magnitude of the  system.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
  But people have been very 

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
supportive, enthusiastic.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
  I've spoken with folks who 

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
have shown commitment in 

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
addition to the willingness to 

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
be uncomfortable if it means 

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
that we can create mental health 

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
programming for our students.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
  And give good outcomes to them.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
  And so I appreciate everyone's 

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
enthusiasm as I continue to kind 

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
of learn the system and figure 

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
out on how we can move forward.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
  I can say that this system has 

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
good bones.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
  When I left my former 

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
institution, someone said to me 

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
on the last day at my sendoff, 

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
aren't you glad you're getting 

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
away from the chaos.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
  And I said well I'm not 

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
leaving higher education, so I'm 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
not really getting away from the 

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
chaos.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
  I'm kind of getting new chaos.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
  But the difference here at 

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Lone Star is that there's heart 

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
and there's energy behind the 

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
work.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
  I've seen a real dedication 

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
from folks to want to really 

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
improve these outcomes for our 

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
students, and I'm excited to be 

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
a part of building together.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:32.000
  Thank you.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
&gt;&gt;:  That concludes my report, 

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
madam chair.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
  Thank you.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
  Our next item

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 is board members, trustees, do 

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
you have any special reports or 

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
announcements?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
  No?

&gt;&gt;:  A couple of items.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
  I had the pleasure of 

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
attending the Houston business 

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
again for being honored.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
  That was a very nice day.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
  I also had a chance to, this 

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
week, attend the dedication of a

putting out a

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 fire.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
  A number of those fire 

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
fighters are on hand.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
  It was a wonderful occasion.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, I had the pleasure of 

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
attending Dr.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Gonzalez and chair Sullivan's 

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
community event at Kingwood, 

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Lone Star College Kingwood.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
  It was the state of the union 

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
event with a lovely luncheon and 

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
it was just spectacular.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
  I thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
  Chair Sullivan and I discussed 

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
how nice, and so did trustee 

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Wilson, who was also there, how 

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
nice it would be for every 

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
institution to have such an 

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
event as far as the state of the 

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
union.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
  Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed 

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
it.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
  Thank you so much.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
&gt;&gt;:  Trustee Wilson?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
&gt;&gt;:  I've been moving and 

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
shaking all  over.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
  So first with the positive 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
award ceremony to recognize our 

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
own Dr.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Vienne, I thought that was 

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
awesome, and to see how many 

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
people that we had actually come 

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
out and celebrate her.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
  I believe like support is 

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
actually action, and I do 

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
believe you felt the action and 

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
love and support from the 

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
institution.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
  And not only that, Lone Star 

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
was, like, recognized, you know 

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
what I'm saying?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
  It was good to see.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
  We had 30 people there, as the 

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
chancellor mentioned and it was 

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
really  nice.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
  So I really appreciate that 

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
and the invite.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
  I also attended the state of 

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Kingwood with Dr.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Gonzalez and chair Sullivan and 

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
it was really, really good to 

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
see all the information and the 

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
growth that they're doing out 

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
there in Kingwood.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
  And I'm excited for the growth 

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
is that you know because we need 

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
it.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
  And I appreciate everybody 

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
putting their time in and the 

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
faculty and staff to make it 

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
happen because I know it's a lot 

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
that goes behind it but you-all 

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
did an awesome job and I 

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
appreciate the information.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
  I also attend, along with 

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
former trustee pierce, we 

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
attended the LSC Tomball special 

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Olympics golf they had at top 

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
golfment everybody -- it was 

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
full.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
  They had the whole bottom part 

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
of top golf blocked off for the 

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
tournament.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
  Everybody that attended 

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
placed, first second or third.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
  So I thought it was really 

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
amazing.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
  They really did a good job.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
  They really know what they're 

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
doing.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
  And so I was just excited for 

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
the -- you know, because that 

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
just shows we don't just focus 

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
on one type.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
  We focus on everybody.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
  So I really appreciated the 

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
invite and I know he's not  

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
here, but the coach of the team, 

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
he's also the coach of the 

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
basketball team for life skills 

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Tomball.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
  And he was just telling me and 

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
former trustee Pierce that they 

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
have the USA special Olympics 

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
team and he went out of 40 

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
teaches to see if he could be 

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
the head coach.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
  And we had three students try 

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
O.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 they didn't make it but he made 

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
it to be the coach.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
  That's a big thing  to do.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
  That's more recognition for 

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Lone Star.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
  So people would know who we 

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
are and let them know we have 

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
good people.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
  We have strong people that are 

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
trying to make a difference in 

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
our kids' lives.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I also attended the Kingwood 

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
fire training pavilion 

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
dedication for doctor Staley and 

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
to see that his parents 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
entrusted us with an endowment 

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
for fire fighters and they 

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
entrusted us to award 

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
scholarships to deserving 

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
students.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
  They even had the first 

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
student receive funding there, 

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
and one who just received 

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
funding from there.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
  Dr.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Gonzalez, you did a good job 

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
with that.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
  And it was really nice to see 

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
the plaque that was going to be 

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
put inside the pavilion.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
  So when the cadets come to 

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
take their rest, the plaque is 

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
there for them to see it was 

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
made possible by this family.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
  So it was great to see on this.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
  And I also attend -- this is 

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
my last -- the back to school 

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
with Dr.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Wright at positive fall brook 

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
and it was an awesome event.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
  It was so many people.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
  There was a lot of people is 

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
there and it was just good to be 

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
able to help, along with

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 trustee Murillo, trustee Meza, 

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
to see the people and the 

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
excitement.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
  Snow cones, corn dogs, hot

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 dogs, all the things.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
  School supplies -- it felt 

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
good to get back in the 

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
community and help again.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you, trustee Wilson.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
  Any of my other colleagues?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
  Trustee Meza?

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
&gt;&gt;:  Good morning.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
  I'm going to chronological 

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
order.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
  So long as my full-time job 

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
with Al dean, we did a trip to 

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
DC.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
  We took 22 young people, 

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
students, graduates from our 

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
high schools to DC and they got 

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
to do the whole tour and see all 

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
the monuments and historical 

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
events, learn about them, that 

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
have shaped our country.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
  We got to tour the Supreme 

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Court also, which is a really 

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
cool experience.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
  And we also had some students 

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
represent and meet with 

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
legislative staff.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
  So we got to meet with the 

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
staff of senator Cornyn, the 

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
district 18 staff which as we 

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
know the position is vacant 

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
currently.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
  And we actually had a special 

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
student, Deliria Smith who I 

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
don't see here, so I'm not sure 

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
if she's gone off to the marines 

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
already, but she attended with 

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
us.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
  We're very proud of her.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
  So all that to say I'm hopeful 

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
that maybe with the program we 

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
have here with our college as 

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
far as the engage the elect rat 

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
program, I'm glad to work with 

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
the facilitators of that program 

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
to get some students out to DC.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
  I'm sure y'all are probably 

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
way ahead of that for me.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
  But any way I can help out, 

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
I'd like to do that.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
  I'm proud of our students.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
  A lot of our Al dean students 

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
do end up coming to Lone Star 

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
and I'm trying to make sure that 

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
I help them and ensure that they 

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
get same opportunity that I was 

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
given from my counselors at 

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
spring ISD to come the Lone Star.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Secondly I'm grateful to the 

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
college and chancellor Castillo 

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
to send me to the  (inaudible) 

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
conference.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
  I represented the college in 

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Atlanta just a few weeks ago and 

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
got to meet with a few people, 

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
colleagues of ours in different 

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
jurisdictions and positions.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
  It was cool for me, since I'm 

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
relatively new to this thing.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
  And so I got to get a little 

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
bit of coaching and mentoring 

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
out there and do a little bit of 

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
elbow rubbing.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
  But it's a really cool 

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
experience and I got to meet a 

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
few other trustees at other 

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
colleges, not just in our area 

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
but throughout country and learn 

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
about some of the challenges 

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
they're facing.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
  Attended a really good session 

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
such as land  use, mental 

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
health, other things that 

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
concern our community currently.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
  So I just want to say thank 

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
you again for allowing me to go 

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
out there and represent the 

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
college.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
  And then also lastly, a big 

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
shout out to Dr.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Wright for his recent event at 

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
fall brook.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
  I know it was hot and you had 

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
your staff out there working 

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
six, seven days a week.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
  Also thank you to Dr.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Lambert for coming to our back 

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
to school event.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
  We had quite a few tables and 

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
talked to a lot of Lone Star 

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
alum, including myself.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
  So thank you to all of our 

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
presidents for the work that you 

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
are doing right now.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
  I know it's crunch time right 

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
now to get all of our students 

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
enrolled.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
  So we're very appreciative of 

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
all the work you're doing.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
  Thank you for that, and we're 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
hopeful for an amazing semester 

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
and year.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
  Thank you so much.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you, trustee Meza.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
  Trustee Murillo?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
  Okay.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
  I just want to take this 

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
opportunity and thank Dr.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Wright for our back to school 

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
event.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
  It was incredibly blessed and 

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
awesome.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
  We served how many students,  

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Dr.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Wright?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
  Over 1100 students, y'all.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
  1100 students for our back to 

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
school fair.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
  And we had obviously, you 

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
know, their back packs and 

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
school supplies.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
  But we also have snow cones, 

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
follow up corn, live music.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
  It was a very wonderful event.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
  So I want to publicly thank Dr.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Wright, all your staff.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
  I know it's -- you know, doing 

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
events is a lot of work.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
  So I really appreciate that.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
  And also fall brook church for 

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
partnering with us and always 

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
being open with Lone Star 

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
College for us to be able to 

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
host events there.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
  So thank you fall brook church 

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
for doing that for us and Dr.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Wright, thank you so much.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
  That was a very, very  good -- 

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
much needed event, as well, as 

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
you could see.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Thank you.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
&gt;&gt;:  Now we move to --

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
&gt;&gt;:  Vice chair, I'm so sorry.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
  Am I being recognized?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
  I think we may have skipped  

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Dr.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Jones' presentation?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, thank you ma'am.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
  Yes, I went a little bit ahead 

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
of myself.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
  So I want to go back to item 

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
B, which is the presentation.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
  Apologies.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
&gt;&gt;:  I will give y'all a minute 

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
to have laptops -- iPads 

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
distributed.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
&gt;&gt;:  Well while they distribute 

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
the iPads, I'll take a second 

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
because I forgot to recognize 

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
one group of people.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
  I've gotten three or four 

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
emails from trustees in the last 

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
two or three weeks commending 

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
the office of the chancellor's 

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
staff and the board liaison.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
  This is me doing me.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
  A lot of work goes into these 

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
meetings for a lot of time the 

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
staff in the Chancellor's Office.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
  It's a weekly labor of love to 

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
sort of just set up our meetings.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
  And so just want to make sure 

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
that we publicly recognize them.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
  And another pitch for our 

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
students, Mr.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 Collins, my chief of staff, my 

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
executive assistant and our 

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
office manager are all former 

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
students of Lone Star College.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
  And so again, we're very proud 

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
of them and really proud of 

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
y'all.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
  Thank you so much for all the 

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
work that you do, Mr.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 Krall, Ms.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 Barnett, Brooke, everybody that 

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
-- Nathaniel -- everybody that 

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
works on these board meetings.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
  The facilities folks, the OTS 

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
folks.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
  I personally appreciate it and 

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
I can tell you that the board 

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
appreciates it because they've 

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
gone out of their way too 

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
commend all of y'all.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
  So I wanted to publicly thank 

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
y'all and apparently it worked 

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
out perfectly while we did 

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
whatever is going on behind me 

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
here.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
  So thank you, chairman 

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Sullivan, for that indulgence.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
  I'm done now

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000
.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
  Dr.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Jones, please  proceed.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you, sir.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
  Good morning, chancellor and 

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Board of Trustees.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
  Lone Star College has a legacy 

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.000
of excellence and

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 innovation for the future.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
  Picture our first generation 

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
students starting at LSC, unsure 

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
of their future and unsure how 

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
to get there.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
  But leaving with a degree, a 

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
job in their career, and the 

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
skills and confidence to thrive.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
  That's the LSC difference 

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
we're amplifying today.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
  Hopefully.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
  Community colleges first open 

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
to expand access to higher 

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
education.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
  Now called community college 1.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
0.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
  Decades later priorities 

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
evolved to emphasize credential 

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
completion or 2.0.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
  And now in recent years, 

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
community college 3.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
0 was coined by the Aspen 

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
institute to recognize the 

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
additional need for postcollege 

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
success.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
  This includes ensuring that 

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
our credentials prepare students 

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
for high demand, high wage 

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
careers and ensuring students 

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
cross the finish line to 

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
employment in those careers.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
  If this rings a bell for you 

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
with credentials of value and 

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
the work of G2 and G5, you are 

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
spot on.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
  For LSC, employment  

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
readiness, experiential learning 

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
and confidence in our graduates 

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
isn't new.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
  However, we continue to 

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
deepen, expand, and innovate new 

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
ways in which we support family 

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
sustaining careers for our 

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
students.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
  Many students arrive with 

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
financial need as a barrier.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
  Through direct employment and 

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
paid internships, we empower 

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
them to support themselves and 

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
their families, ensuring they 

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
can stay and succeed.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
  There are three main ways LSC 

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
puts students to work.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
  We employ them directly, as 

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
you've heard the chancellor 

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
mention this morning, as 

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
students and as alumni.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
  We embed real world experience 

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
in the curriculum through 

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
co-ops, clinicals, and 

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
internships.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
  And we offer a variety of 

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
career support services.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
  Three of the newest we'll 

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
highlight in a few minutes, like 

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
the timber wolf leaders pictured 

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
here, building on a foundation 

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
of access and completion, let's 

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
dive into how we're supporting 

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
postcollege success through 

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
direct employment opportunities.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
  Both campus and system offices 

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
have found ways to bring 

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
students into our teams.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
  Not only is their perspective 

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
invaluable in shaping our 

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
future, but when we're proud of 

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
the graduates we produce, there 

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
is no greater compliment than to 

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
welcome them back as colleagues.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
  The financial aid department 

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
has supported student employment 

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
through work study initiatives, 

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
which include  VA study and 50 

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
state mentor students this  year.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
  $1.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
8 million towards federal work 

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
study positions systemwide 

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
familiarizes students with 

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
professional environments and 

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
effectively prepares them for 

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
successful careers 

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
postgraduation.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
  Since 2017, the office of 

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
legal affairs and student 

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
success has proudly employed 

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
more than 50 former LSC students.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
  These students have 

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
represented every campus across 

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
the system, demonstrating the 

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
team's strong connection within 

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
the LSC community.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
  chancellor Castillo has 

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
carried this practice into the 

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
office of the chancellor.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
  So now LSC graduates like 

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Nathaniel and Brooke are an 

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
integral part of that office, 

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
too.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
  OLES has the potential for 

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
seeing the potential in students 

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
like Pablo.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
  While they are with us, 

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
students like Jocelyn from 

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Houston north can get part-time 

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
employment providing critical 

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
support to other students or 

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
stay connected over the years, 

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
like Stephen Murphy who started 

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
as a student assistant in zero 

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
five and became a full-time 

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
professor last fall.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
  Sometimes student become 

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
future employees because one 

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
person makes a special 

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
connection, as was the case for

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Andrea at North Harris.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
  Through our online college, 

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
students like G

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
abriela learn not only hard 

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
skills but also interpersonal 

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
skills.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
  Co-ops, clinicals, and

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 internships.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
  These industry partnerships 

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
are mutually beneficial, 

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
ensuring our courses and 

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
programs are a responsive to 

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
industry demands.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
  In process technology and 

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
instrumentation, robust 

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
partnerships create remarkable

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 opportunities.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
  when our students

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 impress their employers, like

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 James Don, sometimes we get the 

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
double win, as he is now 

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
employed and also adjunct 

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
faculty.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
  Internships can even place 

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
students into the business 

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
operations of the college, like 

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
OTS and college relations teams, 

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
who hire student interns to 

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
apply their learning in real 

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
world operations in the 

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
supportive culture of LSC.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
  Additional career support from 

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
campus and system teams include 

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
job fairs, career exploration 

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
activities, career star for 

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
online connections with 

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
employers, and workshops on 

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
interview and resume writing.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
  As we embrace the chancellor's 

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
challenge to ensure students are 

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
better positioned to thrive, new 

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
promising practices have 

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
launching.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
  As one LSC, these practices 

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
are shared, expanded, and 

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
evolving to support the LSC 

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
community.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
  Three such programs will be 

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
featured, but more are always on 

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
the way, benefiting students 

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
like Madison, whose role in 

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
student services prepares her as 

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
a future engineer.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
After launching falcon force in 

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
23, LSC CyFair created the 

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
falcon internship program in 

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
February 24 to place students in 

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
paid internships aligned with 

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
their career aspirations but 

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
separate from their classes.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
  Successful launch required 

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
creating new industry 

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
connections, now exceeding 150 

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
businesses and developing 

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
industry specific training to 

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
help students compete.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
  Logical 170 students have 

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
received at least one customized 

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
coaching session.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
  Under the strategic priority 

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
to build the campus for career 

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
through completion, the 

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
opportunity had you been will 

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
launch micro-internships, a 

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
national association of colleges 

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
and employers or NACE, 

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
competencies aligned pilot for 

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
new students, industry field 

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
trips, and more.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
  Students like

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 Daniela are equipped to succeed 

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
as a commercial intern for 

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
congressman Wesley hunt.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
  LSC university park developed 

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
a student communication pathway 

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
that evolved from their pain 

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
squad of five student content 

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
creators.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
  As of June, a formal paid 

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
internship program.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
  The new social media marketing 

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
internship at UP is an 

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
intentional career aligned 

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
student role developed within UP

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 relations.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
  Interns contribute to campaign 

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
strategy, experience, event 

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
planning, and internal marketing 

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
while developing real world 

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
skills in communications, PR, 

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
and digital content.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
  These experiences not only 

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
prepare students like Andrea for 

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
postcollege careers but 

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
strengthen their ties to the 

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
college.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
  In its third year, timber wolf

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 leaders provided paid 

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
opportunities for student 

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
leaders and contributing 

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
directly to campus initiatives.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
  Notably, two program 

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
participants have successfully 

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
transferred to roles within 

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
college departments.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
  Impacting over 13 departments 

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
across campus, more than f12 

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
timber wolf leaders have now 

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
been integrated into every major 

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
division.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
  A hundred percent of these 

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
students have not only been 

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
retained into the program but 

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
have a hundred percent 

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
graduation and transfer rates, 

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
as well.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
  Peyton shared, this experience 

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
has helped me not only find my 

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
voice but use it with confidence 

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
and purpose.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
  These weren't just initiatives.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
  They're transformative proof 

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
that LSC students are better off 

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
because of us.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
  In a competitive job market, 

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
programs like these bridge the 

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
gap between education and 

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
employment.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
  As the energy around these 

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
teams is electric, idea sharing 

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
and intercampus collaborations 

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
continue with grassroots leading 

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
the way.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
  I've compiled the more 

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
detailed students stories into a 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
booklet for each of you, which 

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Fatima will share.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you very much, Dr.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Jones.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
  Before you leave the podium, 

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
we'll ask for questions.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
  I'll start to my right.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
  Any questions, comments?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
  No?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
  No?

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
  Great job presenting the 

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 presentation to us

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
.  Trustee Murillo?

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
&gt;&gt;:  I want to commend you.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
  You presented it extremely 

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
well, and just go get it!

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
  Thank you.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you, trustee Murillo.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
  Thank you, Dr.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Jones.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
  Next we'll move into committee 

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
reports from board members.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
  First let's see, trustees, do 

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
we have any special reports or

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 announcements?

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
&gt;&gt;:  I do.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
&gt;&gt;:  Start on my left?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
  Okay.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
  Trustee  Stoma?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
&gt;&gt;:  The committee reports, 

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
right?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
&gt;&gt;:  These are special reports 

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
or announcements.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
  Trustee Broussard?

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
  Trustee Wilson?

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
  Okay.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
  Thank you.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
  Okay.  Pardon me.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000
  Now committee reports.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
  Trustee Stoma?

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, I want to thank

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 Ms.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 Bridgett Johnson for furnishing 

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
her monthly report to the board, 

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
and this is for board eyes only.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
  I know she's not here today 

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
and I wish her well and a speedy 

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
recovery.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
  She's doing an excellent job, 

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
as well as her team.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
  These reports are important 

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
because it allows the board to 

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
keep track of what's going on 

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
and to be able to ask questions, 

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
either to the chancellor or 

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
through the board liaison.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
  I've also spoken with the 

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
chancellor several times, and 

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
having Ms.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 Johnson present five or ten 

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
minutes at each board meeting.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
  There are three advantages to 

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
doing this.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
  One, it gives the board again 

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
an opportunity to ask questions.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
  If there's any proprietary 

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
information or questions asked, 

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
those can be deferred to private 

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
sessions.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
  But it gives visibility  also, 

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
public transparency, to what 

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
we're doing.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
  We're going to spend tens of 

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
millions of dollars on the 

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
transformers of these 

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
information systems, tens of 

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
millions of dollars of public 

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
money and they have a right to 

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
know where that money is going.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
  So it gives some public 

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
transparency to what we're doing 

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
here.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Thirdly, it really helps Ms.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 Johnson and her team to know

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 that not only does the 

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
chancellor have their support, 

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
but the board has their support.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
  In my 30 plus years of 

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
managing programs and projects, 

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
I always have a requirement to 

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
report to the senior level 

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
management, CXO, BPs

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
, et cetera, board members.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
  And that's important.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
  It's important to know that 

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
they're behind you because any 

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
project or program that does not 

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000
have senior management 

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
involvement fails.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
  That's a matter of  research.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
  You can look that one up.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
  So I believe, my opinion, my 

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
professional opinion and Ms.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 Bridgett Johnson and I'm going 

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
to call out

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 Ms.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Chris Williams.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
  She's the CIO.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
  She's the person who gets 

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
things done and she's doing an 

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
excellent job, as well.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
  And the two of them are the 

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
right people to lead this 

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
endeavor.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
  So I encourage them to have 

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000
time before the board.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
  I encourage them and support 

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
them fully.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000
  They're the right people for 

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
the job.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
  And we need to support them 

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
and give them, you know, 

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
whatever support we can in any 

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
way to help them move this 

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
forward because it's not easy.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
  And they've really not done 

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
anything this -- how should I 

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
say -- scope, scoping before.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000
  And they are very accomplished 

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
folks.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
  But still, every project, 

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000
every program, every 

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
transformation is new and 

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
they're going to have issues and 

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
they're going to need to entrust 

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
those issues before the board 

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
and we need a good rapport with 

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
them.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
  So again, I want to thank them 

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
for their work and encourage 

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
them to carry on.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
  That's all I have.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you, trustee Stoma.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
  As a practice I started a 

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
couple months ago, we're going 

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
to call on each committee.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
  Policy  review, chair Saldivar?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
  Okay.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
  Thank you.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 chancellor goals and 

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
evaluation, chair Murillo?

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
&gt;&gt;:  Not this month.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
  I will report next month.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, sir.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
  Thank you very much.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
  Grievance committee, 

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
chairwoman Wilson?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
  Okay.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
  Thank you.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
  Committee on committees, chair 

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 Cain?

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
  Okay.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
  Thank you.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
  Community engagement, chairman 

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Meza?

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
&gt;&gt;:  No updates at this time.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
&gt;&gt;:  Finance which is under me 

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
is trying to schedule a meeting 

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
right now.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000
  We'll now move to committee 

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
charges.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
  It's something that we started 

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000
working with the administration 

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
on creating a charge for each 

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
committee, both ad hoc and 

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
standings.  Mr.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 Krall has the latest

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 work product that has been 

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
reviewed by legal, by the 

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
administration, and is now being 

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
passed out to each trustee.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
  So each trustee will have a 

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
charge of all the committee 

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
charges being released today.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000
  There are a couple still in 

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
progress.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:32.000
  Thank you.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
  So why you might remember that 

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
we did a technology committee 

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
previously.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
  So that one is done.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000
  Included in the packet today

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 is community engagement 

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
committee charge.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
  Grievance committee, that's 

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
chair Wilson.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
  Policy review committee, 

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
committee chair Saldivar.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
  And committees on -- excuse 

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
me, committee on committees 

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000
committee charge.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
  That sounds funny.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
  Trustee I know Cain.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
  So when you have time, review 

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
these.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
  Reach out for assistance.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
  And also be mindful that every 

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
committee has a staff resource 

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
assigned to it.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
  And if you don't remember who 

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000
that is, Mr.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 Krall or Ms.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 Barnett will provide that 

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
information to you.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
  But I'm excited about the 

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
committee charges because I 

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
think they're going to give us a 

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
sense of direction and 

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
priorities that need to be 

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
addressed as opposed to trying 

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
to come up with something to 

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
work on.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
  So I appreciate everyone's 

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
indulgence on that.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Any questions?

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
  Okay.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000
  Good.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
  Thank you.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
  Consideration of the consent 

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
agenda.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
  We'll now move forward with 

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
consideration of our consent 

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000
agenda.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
  Are there any items that need 

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
to be pulled for separate 

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
consideration?

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
  I'll start on my left.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
  Trustee Murillo?

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
  Trustee Cain?

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000
&gt;&gt;:  Item 22.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
&gt;&gt;:  Item 22 will be pulled.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
  Trustee Cain.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
  Trustee Meza?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000
&gt;&gt;:  No, sir.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
&gt;&gt;:  Trustee Saldivar?

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
  Trustee Wilson?

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000
  And chancellor, I'm going to 

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
pull item 28 so the 

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
administration can address it.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
  All right.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
  The following items have been 

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
pulled from the consent agenda 

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000
for separate consideration, item 

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
22 and item 28.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
  So may I have a motion for 

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
items one through 21 and

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 23 through 27?

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000
  Trustee Wilson motion.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
  May I have a second?

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000
  Trustee Saldivar second.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Any discussion?

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
  If not, I'll do a roll call

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 vote on the items called.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000
  Trustee Saldivar?

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
  Thank you.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
  Trustee Wilson?

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000
  Thank you.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
  Trustee Broussard?

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
  Thank you.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
  Trustee Stoma?

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
  Thank you.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
  Trustee Meza?

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
  Trustee  Cain?

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
  And I vote yes as well.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
  The item  passes.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
We'll now pull item number

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 22.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000
  Could I have a motion for item 

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
22?

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
  Trustee Wilson.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
  Thank you.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
  Do I have a second?

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
  And trustee Cain, item 22 is 

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
yours, sir.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000
  In going through the agenda, 

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.000
item 22 really jumped out at me.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
  It's the

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 Puente project and it's about 

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000
expanding the project, which I 

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
think is just a great idea.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
  This is a project that is in 

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000
collaboration with UC Berkeley.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000
  Its focus is on providing

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
 enhanced services to

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 educationally unrepresented 

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000
students, many of whom are also 

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
economically disadvantaged 

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
students.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
  It seeks to level the playing 

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
field for these students, which 

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000
is a great thing.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
  It benefits those students, 

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
and in a larger sense it 

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
benefits everyone.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
  And so I am just totally in 

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
support of this program and 

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000
wanted to see if there was 

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
additional information that we 

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
could, through the Chancellor's 

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Office, gain from that item.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
  Any comments?

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
&gt;&gt;:  Dr.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 Wright, will you come up here, 

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:05.000
please?

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
&gt;&gt;:  Good morning, trustees.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
  We are very excited and want 

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000
to thank you for the support of 

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
the Puente program.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
  We are in the process now of 

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000
expanding university park is on 

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
board now.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
  We have two campuses.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
  And it's worked very well.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000
  So tell you what this is 

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
about, it's a program that takes 

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000
an academic and a mentoring 

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
model and the focus is on first 

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
time college students with 

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000
specific focus on first 

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
generation students.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
  We like it because as you know 

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000
one of our G2 goals is retention 

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
of first year students.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000
  And so this is a model that 

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
helps our faculty and our staff 

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
to know how to connect.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
  And so there's a couple of 

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000
ways.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
  There's three different ways 

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000
in which it supports our 

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
students.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
  One, there's a general cohort 

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
and the students come through 

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
together, taking certain courses 

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
like all your English, your 

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000
speech, your psychology, your 

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000
arts courses and they work 

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000
together.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
  There's another model in which 

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
like, for instance, at Houston 

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
north we have a mentoring model 

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
of all first time college 

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
students.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
  And so the faculty go through 

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
and they're trained on 

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
techniques to deal with first 

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
generation college students.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000
  That alone is about 750 

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
students.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
  And then there are several 

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000
faculty members who just became 

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
certified just for the purpose 

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
of teaching their classes.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
  And to tell you the type of 

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000
impact that we've had, over the 

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
past four years, we now have 

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
about 44 faculty and staff 

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000
members that are certified and 

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
have gone through the training.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
  And to tell you a little bit 

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
about just the success of it, 

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
the cohorts over the past three 

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000
years have all had over 90 

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
percent course success rates, 

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000
meaning A, B, or Cs in courses.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000
  And to put that in 

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
perspective, that's about 12 

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
percent higher this past year 

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
than our overall system average.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
  And that's with once again 

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000
first time in college, first 

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
generation, underrepresented 

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
students.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
  And it's all about focusing up 

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000
on bringing the backgrounds of 

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
the students into the classroom 

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
where they matter, with 

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
everything that they're bringing 

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
to it.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
  The content helps the faculty 

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
relates to it.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
  The advisers relate to them.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000
  So it's been a  highly, highly 

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
successfully program and I just 

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
want to end with this point.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000
  It's not an administrator 

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000
driven program.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
  It's a faculty driven program.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000
  I could tell you some of the 

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
first trainings the faculty got 

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
together, asked for some 

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
funding, and they went through 

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
this training themselves.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
  We jumped on the back end and 

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
said if you support it, we 

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
support it too.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
  So I want to commend the 

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
faculty for keeping it alive all 

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000
this time and look forward to it 

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
continuing to help our G2 goals

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
&gt;&gt;:  Good, trustee Cain?

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
  Good.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
  Thank you, Dr.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 Wright.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000
  Any other questions or 

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
comments on 22?

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000
  I'll do a roll call vote.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000
  Trustee Saldivar?

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000
  Thank you.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000
  Trustee Wilson?

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
  Thank you.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
  Trustee Broussard?

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
  Trustee Stoma?

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000
  Trustee Meza?

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
  Trustee Murillo?

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
  Trustee Cain?

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
  And I vote yes.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
  The item passes.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
  Next is item number 28.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000
  May I have a motion for item 

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000
28?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000
  Trustee Wilson.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
  Thank you.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000
  May I have a second?

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000
  Trustee Saldivar for the 

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.000
seconds.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000
  Thank you.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
  The administration wanted to 

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000
comment on this item.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, thank you, chair.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
  Like I said earlier, this is 

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
an FTC application on behalf of 

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000
fox con, which is a major 

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000
manufacturer.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000
  Actually I think it's pretty 

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000
much the manufacturer of 

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
iPhones, iPads, and a whole

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 set of different products for 

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
different companies.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
  But primarily the one we've 

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
been working with is Apple.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000
  So most of you have read and 

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
heard about this massive 

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
investment that Apple, along 

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000
with the Trump administration, 

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000
are making into chip 

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000
manufacturing, server 

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000
manufacturing, and really sort 

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000
of trying to bring manufacturing 

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000
back on a big scale to the 

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
United States, particularly 

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Texas.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000
  And it just so happens that 

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
the site location for these new 

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000
proposed factories happen to be 

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000
in our service area over in our 

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000
fall brook neighborhood is where 

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
these are going to be built.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000
  And they are moving at 

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
lightning speed.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000
  We've met now twice with both 

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
the leaders of what I'll call 

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
system office fox con and then 

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
we also met with the specific 

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000
center of fox con leaders here 

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000
recently.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
  And they, if I understood them 

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
correctly, they have to be up 

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
and running in production 

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000
essentially by spring.

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000
  By late spring they have to 

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000
get going.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
  So they came to me and said 

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
can we push up this FTC 

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
application?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
  It was originally supposed to 

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
be in September.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
  We pushed it to August because 

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
we want to help get them going 

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
as quickly as possible.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
  What it means for us, they're 

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
projecting at the least 2500 

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
jobs and these are very well 

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
paying jobs because one of the 

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
things I've learned in meeting 

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
with them is a lot of our jobs 

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
in manufacturing went abroad 

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
when labor was cheaper abroad.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
  But one of the dynamics that's 

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
happening now is that cheap 

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
labor abroad is being replaced 

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
by robots.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
  And so now they need somebody 

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
to essentially engineer the 

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
program, to program the robots.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
  And that's where the local 

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
aspect of it comes.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
  And I committed to come to the 

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
board with my full

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
 endorsement.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
  Mr.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
 Collins is back there on behalf 

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
of Apple and they've shown a lot 

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
of energy that I have not seen 

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
in quite some time from an 

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
employer that's willing to 

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
partner with us, provide better 

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
jobs, family sustaining wages to 

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
our students.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
  So again, I urge you without 

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
reservation to please adopt 

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
action item number 28 because I 

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
think it's the beginning of 

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
something that's going to be 

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
really special and unique at 

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Lone Star College for our 

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
students.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you, chancellor.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
  And to those in the audience 

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
with fox con or the  

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
contractors, please know how 

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
much we appreciate this.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
  Chancellor, if you covered 

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
this earlier, I apologize.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
  But I led a course that

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
 payment in lieu of taxes and 

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
there's also no  net loss to the 

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
system.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
&gt;&gt;:  Correct.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
  Essentially, it's an  offset.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
  They still pay what we would 

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
get, so we're not letting them 

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
off the hook for the money but 

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
the way the money is paid 

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
affects considerations for them 

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
that really don't affect us.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
  And so that's the reason that 

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
for us it's essentially a 

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
neutral thing and especially 

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
when they've committed to be 

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
partners in hiring our students.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
  It's a win.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
&gt;&gt;:  Extraordinary.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
  Any comments?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
  Trustee Meza?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
&gt;&gt;:  I wanted to ask because I 

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
know we're entering an 

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
agreement, with the pilot 

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
agreement and then they also 

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
have the FTZ, the foreign trade 

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
zone application, how long does 

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
this last for?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
  Is this something we have to 

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
renew at certain periods of time?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
&gt;&gt;:  It is a pilot, which means 

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
we can jump off at some point 

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
--

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
&gt;&gt;:  (inaudible).

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
&gt;&gt;:  I'm sorry.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
  Let me restart.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
  The pilot doesn't mean at a 

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
but yes, there is a point where 

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
essentially we can pull it back 

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
is my understanding.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
  Yes.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
&gt;&gt;:  The designation would only 

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
be for a certain period of time 

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
and then they could reapply for 

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
it but it's a limited amount of 

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
time.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
  Sorry to speak over you, 

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
chancellor.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
&gt;&gt;:  That's okay.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
  It is both a capitol P pilot 

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
and a lower case p pilot

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
.&gt;&gt;:  Any other comments is no.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
  We'll do a roll call vote.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
  Trustee Saldivar?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
  Trustee Wilson?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
  Trustee Stoma?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
  Trustee Meza?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
  Trustee Vogt absent.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
  Trustee Cain?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
 sullivan votes yes, the item 

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
passes.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
We now move to financial report.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
   Dr.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
 Vienne will come up for round

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
 two today.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, sir.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
  You get to hear from me again.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
  Apologies.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
  So these are the financial 

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
statements.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
  Just as a reminder to the 

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
board, for month ending June 

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
30th.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
  So when you're looking at 

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
actual revenues, you can see 

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
that state appropriations 

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
specifically are tracking down 

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
from where they were in FY24 and 

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
that was specifically because 

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
the state's payment was delayed 

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
to us beyond the June payment 

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
when it was expected.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
  We didn't actually receive 

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
that until July.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
  So even though it's recognized 

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
there through June 30th, we have 

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
now actually received the final 

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
payment but it was not 

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
recognized in June.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
  So I do want to point out that 

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
for you.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
  So in June, the check was in 

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
the mail.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
  We did finally receive both 

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
checks from the state to make us 

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
whole for state appropriations.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
  When you're looking at 

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
expenditures through month end 

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
of the 30th again, we are 

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
tracking pretty well where we 

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
have been this previous time 

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
last year.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
  We have 345 million in total 

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
expenditures of a 513 

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
million-dollar budget through 

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
month end of June.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
  So again as you look at that, 

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
we are still ahead in revenue.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
  We're at 97.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
8 percent of the budget now with 

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
receiving the state payment, we 

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
actually have competed that.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
  And again we'll report more on 

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
that next month so you can see 

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
those actual figures.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
  79.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
8 percent though in budgeted 

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
revenue had been received 

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
through June 30th.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
  And then we're tracking a 

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
little bit down in expenditures, 

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
which means we spent less this 

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
year as compared to the same 

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
point in a previous year.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
  So out of the 

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.000
$3,513,000,000,000 budget, we've 

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
only spent 83 percent of that.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
  So we continue to monitor that.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
  So when ere looking at your 

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
financial statement, I do want 

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
to highlight a couple of 

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
variances, many of which I've 

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
talked about in the budget 

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
workshop.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
  When you're looking at the 

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
variance, you can see $3.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
4 million variance in tuition.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
  That is to the positive, which 

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
means we've received more in -- 

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
we anticipate we will receive 

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
more in tuition fees than what 

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
we budgeted for to the tune of 

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
about 3.4 million.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
  So again, we did recognize 

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
that moving forward for this 

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
year's budget.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
  State appropriations, there 

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
was a delta.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
  That was a timing between the 

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
file and the final run that they 

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
did.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
  Taxes, we residue 8.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
5 million more than anticipated.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
  And then again investments, 4.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
4.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
  So again you heard me speak 

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
about investments ask 

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
recognizing that as actual 

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
revenue.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
  You can see why we want to 

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
recognize that.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
  It's consistently been 

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
recognized the last two years as 

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
received.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
  So we have a delta of about 

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
$26 million more this year in 

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
revenue than what was budgeted.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
  So all to the  betterment of 

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
the system.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
  So always good news to report.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
  When you're looks at the 

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
financial statements and the 

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
expenditures, to date there's no 

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
significant variances to report, 

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
which just means everything is 

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
lining out the way that we 

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
anticipated.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
  Again, only spending about

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
 70.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
3 percent of the expenditure 

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
budget to this point in month 

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
ten of a 12 month cycle.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
In looking at your board 

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
binders, you do have additional 

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
documents in your documents.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
  And then when you're looking 

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
at cash reserves, just to remind 

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
everyone, this stays static 

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
because it is looking only by 

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
definition at a singular point 

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
in year.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
  So for FY25, we have

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
 169 in reserves.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
  We do anticipate that growing 

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
for next year, taking into 

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
account the additional $26 

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.000
million that was received I 

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
 beyond what was budgeted.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
  And this does not include 

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
capital projects or the ERP.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
  So we do anticipate this 

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
growing for next year.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
  Any questions from the chair 

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
or the board?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
&gt;&gt;:  Trustees?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
  Trustee Meza?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
&gt;&gt;:  Dr.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
 Vienne, I have a quick question.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
  Going back to the increased 

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
revenue from tuition, it's 

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
closer the 3.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
5, right?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
  The million?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
  Do we know --

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yeah.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
&gt;&gt;:  Do we know where that came 

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
from?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
&gt;&gt;:  Yes, absolutely great 

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
question, sir.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
  When we have budgeted, our 

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
focus has been on student 

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
outcomes and student success.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
  We've taken away the focus on 

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
growth.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
  So both last year and in this 

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
year's budget, we're not 

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
projecting growth.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
  So we budgeted flat that last 

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
year.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
  We're budgeting flat again 

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
year.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
  So that was recognizing growth 

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
that we received that we did not 

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
budget for.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
  So we received additional 3.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
4, almost $3.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
5 million based on growth.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
  This year we recognized that 

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
growth.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
  We're not budgeting for growth 

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
this year, just recognizing that 

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
if we stay flat, if we continue 

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
to grow this year, we hope, we 

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
would like to.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
  But again the focus is on 

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
student graduation and success.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
  Then you would also see that 

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
variance because it's 

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
recognizing the growth that we 

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
didn't put in the budget.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
  Is that helpful?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
&gt;&gt;:  Definitely.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
  And I know the focus is on 

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
retention and of course keeping 

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
the students coming back and 

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
getting them to graduate but we 

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
can't stop students from 

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
enrolling.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
  And they want to enroll.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
  So that's great.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
&gt;&gt;:  Just to offer an 

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
operational sort of perspective 

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
for that, it goes back to the 

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
same dynamic that I talked about 

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
during the budget meeting.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
  If you budget growth, then it 

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
gets allocated and you forecast 

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
it.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
  And so what happened for the 

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
way it used to work is we would 

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
budget growth and then when the 

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
growth did not happen, then you 

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
had to pull back.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
  And so people felt like budget 

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
was being cut.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
  And it wasn't that.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
  It's the growth estimates 

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
weren't what we had budget hard 

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
baked essentially into the 

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
budget.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
  And so just like HB8 money

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
 now with enrollments, if we say

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
 that we're not focused on 

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
enrollments but we budget on it, 

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
then that doesn't align and 

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
culturally there's a mismatch 

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
between our budget and our 

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
strategy.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
  If we get the money, we will 

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
recognize it and then we will 

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
spend it.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
  But we don't need to build a 

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
budget in my opinion that says 

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
we're going to grow x, y, and z.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
  So it has nothing to do with 

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
turning people away at the door 

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
or students, it has to do with 

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
are we counting on that money 

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and are we counting it in a way 

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
that if it doesn't come true, 

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
we're going to have to redo 

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
things just like HB8.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
  So it's a student tuition 

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
strategy where fundamentally 

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
just back to basics, don't spend 

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
money you don't have until you 

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
have it.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
  And that's fundamentally what 

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
we're doing across all income 

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
streams.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you, trustee Meza.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
 thank you very much, Dr.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 Vienne.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
  Appreciate it.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
&gt;&gt;:  Thank you.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
&gt;&gt;:  And before we go in closed 

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
session, I apologize.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
  I missed part of the meeting.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
  So I want to thank vice chair 

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Saldivar for running both the 

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
budget workshop and the meeting.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
  Thank you.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
  Second, I missed makes some 

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
comments about some activities, 

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
so if you could just bear with 

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
me a momentful it's been a very  

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
active month.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
  I appreciate what everyone 

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
here at the board wants to 

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
accomplishings the good they 

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
want to do and the engagement 

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
results from everyone working 

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
together.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
  With this said, I want to 

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
thank Dr.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
 Melissa Gonzalez and her team 

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
at Kingwood.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
  Event highlighted the many 

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
programs and activities offered 

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
and included not just the main 

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
campus but the centers, as well.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
  I could feel the energy and 

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
interest in the room.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
  Afterwards, many guests stayed 

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
to mingle, ask questions, and 

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
tour.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
  It was great to have y'all 

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
there.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
  Next item is to recognize Lone 

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Star College foundation.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
  Earlier this week, Lone Star 

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
College Kingwood, they held a 

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
ceremony dedicating a fire 

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
pavilion to someone who had lost 

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
their life fighting a

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
 fire.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
  It honored Gary Staley

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
 who lost his life fighting a 

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
fire department he was a 

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
foundation -- this was a 

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
foundation event and would not 

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
have been possible without the 

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
generosity of the Staley family.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
  To the point take a minute to 

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
acknowledge the work that Ms.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
 Gotye does.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
  She is a consummate 

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
professional, always promoting 

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
the foundation and the work that 

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
it does.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
  In closing, I want to thank 

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
trustees Wilson and Cain for 

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
attending event, as well.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
  We'll now move into closed 

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
session under one or more of the 

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
following provisions.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
  Section 551.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
071, section 551.072.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
  Section 551.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
074, and section 551.076.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
&gt;&gt;:  I reconvene this board 

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
meeting at 1:43 p.m.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
  Are there any suggested future 

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
agenda items.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
  Looking to my right?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
  Any future items?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
  To my left?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
  Yes?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
&gt;&gt;:  Whenever we went to DC, a 

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
few of us, I had encountered

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
 some community colleges  that 

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
-- and I would look into how to 

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
put this in policy or what their

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
 process is, but they have 

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
student trustees.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
  At least one student trustee.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
  So going back to the goals of 

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
the college as far as community 

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
engagement, listening to our 

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
students, giving them a seat at 

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
the table, I would like to see 

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
something next month on the 

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
agenda if necessary.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
  If  not -- but I would either 

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
way like to see us starting a 

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
student trustee program.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
  And if it has to be put on the 

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
agenda for board approval, I 

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
would like to see ha.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
  And if not and we can still do 

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
it, then however we can get it

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
 done.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
  That's my approval.&gt;&gt;:  Okay.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
  Let's give the administration 

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
whatever time they need, if they 

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
need a month or two.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
  Because we're getting ready to 

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
start the fall semester and 

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
budget.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
  But good idea.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Anything?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
  Okay with no further business 

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
to discuss, this board meeting
