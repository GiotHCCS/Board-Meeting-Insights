00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 MANY OF WHOM ARE THE STUDENTS

 THE COLLEGE OR CONTRACTORS WHO 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH US.  

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 ALTHOUGH AN ACTION ITEM LIKE 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 THIS NOW ROUTINELY APPEARS ON 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 THE AGENDA ABOUT THIS TIME OF 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 I WANT TO SHIFT GEARS TO AN 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 UPCOMING PROHIBITION FROM 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 AUSTIN IN ORDER TO COMMEND THE 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 BOARD AND ADMINISTRATION FOR 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 WISELY TAKING ACTIONS IN THE 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 PAST THAT WILL REDUCE THE 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON STUDENTS AND 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 EMPLOYEES IN THE FUTURE.  I AM 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 SPEAKING OF SENATE BILL 8 WHICH 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 HAS BEEN PASSED PIPET HOUSES OF 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 THE LEGISLATURE AND AWAITS THE 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE.  THIS IS 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 THE SO-CALLED BATHROOM BILL 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 WHICH REQUIRES TRANSGENDER 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 PEOPLE TO USE THE BATHROOMS AND 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 TRESSING ROOMS CORRESPONDING TO 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 THEIR GENDER AT BIRTH.  

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 VIOLATIONS WILL BE ACCOMPANIED 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 BOY HEFTY FINES NOT BY THE 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED BUT BY THE 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 COLLEGE.  I AM GRATEFUL AND 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 PROUD THAT LONE STAR COLLEGE 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 MADE A CONSCIOUS AND PROACTIVE 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 DECISION A FEW YEARS AGO THAT 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 ALL ALL NEW COLLEGE BUILDINGS 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 WOULD INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 GENDER NEUTRAL SINGLE OCCUPANCY 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 BATHROOM AND THAT AS SOON AS 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 PRACTICAL ALL EXISTING 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 BUILDINGS WOULD BE RETROFITTED 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 TO INCLUDE ONE.  IN FACT IF 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 THIS EFFORT IS NOT COMPLETE 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 SYSTEM WIDE I BELIEVE IT IS 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 VERY CLOSE.  THAT'S BATHROOMS 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 PROVIDE A SAFE AND DIGNIFIED 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 ALTERNATIVE FOR TRANSGENDER 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES AND ALSO 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 ARE A BENEFIT TO OTHERS 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 INCLUDING PARENTS WHO NEED TO 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 BRING SMALL CHILDREN ON CAMPUS 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 AND DISABLED PERSONS WHO NEED 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 ASSISTANCE AND HAVE CAREGIVERS 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 OF A DIFFERENT GENDER.  WE NEED 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 LOCATIONS OF THESE PATH ROOMS 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 ARE WELL PUBLICIZED.  I KNOW 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 THERE ARE MANY STRONGLY HELD 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 POINTS OF VIEW RELATED TO THIS 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 ISSUE.  WHAT DISTRESSES ME IS 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 THAT AD MIST ALL OF THE DEBATE 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 THE HUMANITY A OF PEOPLE GETS 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 FORGOTTEN.  I SERVED FOR MANY 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 YEARS AS CHAIR OF THE 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000

 EVERY SEMESTER.  THIS IS NOT 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 SURPRISING SINCE TRANS GENDER

 PROXIMATELY 100 STUDENTS OVER

 THE SEMESTER.  ALL OF THESE 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000

 &gt;&gt;  GOOD MORNING I AM HERE TO 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 ADDRESS A COMMENT AND SOME 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 CONCERNS THAT WERE FILED BACK 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 IN 2024 OF AUGUST IN REFERENCE 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 TO THE ATCP PROGRAM HERE AT 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 LONE STAR.  AFTER 11 YEARS IN 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 EDUCATION IN HOUSTON, THREE 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 YEARS OF MY DAUGHTER BEING 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 ENROLLED IN CY-FAIR ISD LOCALLY 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 I WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED AND 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 HAPPY TO BE ACCEPTED INTO THE 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 ACTP PROGRAM.  MY FIRST EVER.  

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 IN MAY OF 2022.  I STARTED 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 CLASSES IN AUGUST OF 2022.  IN 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 THAT MOMENT I KNEW MY DREAM OF 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 BEING A CERTIFIED TEACHER WILL 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 COME TO PASS.  UPON ENTRANCE I 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 NOTICED UNFAIR PLACEMENT EACH 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 WITH THE HIGH ENOUGH GPA I WAS 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 ADVERTISED AND GIVEN DIRECTIVES 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 TO TAKE EXAMS THAT WERE NOT 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 INTEREST REQUIREMENTS BASED ON 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 MY TRANSCRIPT GPA'S AND THE 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.  I WAS 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 ALSO NOT EVEN ABLE TO 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 MOST OF THE RANDOM ADVISORS 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 WITHOUT BEING DISPLACED OR END 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 TO THE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 NOTHING TO DO WITH CONTINUING 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 EDUCATION.  I CAN REMEMBER ONE 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 OF THE NINE ADVISORS WITHIN 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 THAT TIMEFRAME WOULD CC ME OR 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 REFER ME TO SOMEONE IN THE 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT OR 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT WHEN 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 SPECIFICALLY ASKING QUESTIONS 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 IN REFERENCE TO EDUCATIONAL 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 RESOURCES, THAT ALONE WAS JUST 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 ONE OF THE MANY CONCERNS WITH 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 THE ADVISING THAT I EXPERIENCED 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 WHILE ENROLLED IN THIS PROGRAM.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 OVERVIEW OF STUDY ABROAD AND 

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 THE IMPACT AND ATTRACTION IT

 NOTE, EVERY PICTURE YOU SEE 

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 HERE IN THESE SLIDES ARE LEGAL 

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 PHOTOS FROM STUDY ABROAD TRIPS 

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 FROM FACULTY AND STUDENTS.  

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 THESE ARE NOT STOCK PHOTOS.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 THIS IS A MAP HIGHLIGHTING THE 

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 SCOPE AND RANGE WE HAVE OVER 

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 THE YEARS AT LSC, TAKING 

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 STUDENTS.  THIS IS REPRESENTING 

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 OVER 5 CONTINENTS WE HAVE TAKEN 

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 OUR STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE THE 

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 WORLD.  WE ARE POSSIBLY WORKING 

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 ON A SIXTH IN AUSTRALIA BUT YOU 

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 CAN SEE FROM EUROPE, SOUTH 

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 AMERICA AND MOST RECENTLY, 

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 ISSUE AND A NORTH AFRICA.  WE 

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 ARE SENDING OUR STUDENTS OUT 

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 INTO THE WORLD AND THEY ARE 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 BRINGING THE WORLD BACK HOME TO 

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 LSC.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 I THINK THIS MATTERS STUDY 

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 ABROAD FOR OUR STUDENTS.  FOR 

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 MANY IT IS THEIR FIRST 

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE OF THE 

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 COUNTRY AND FOR MANY IT MIGHT 

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 THEIR ONLY EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE 

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 OF THE COUNTRY.  SOME IT IS 

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 THEIR FIRST EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE 

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 OF THE STATE.  FIRST TRIP ON AN 

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 AIRPLANE, ON A TRAIN.  SO WE 

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 ARE REALLY OPENING UP A GLOBAL 

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 AND INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE 

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 FOR SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS, 

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DON'T 

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 HAVE A OPPORTUNITY AND MEANS TO 

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 EXPERIENCE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 SO MANY OTHER STUDENTS IN THIS 

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 COUNTRY.  THE SUPPORT WE GET 

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 FROM LONE STAR, THE BOARD AND 

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 THE CHANCELLOR AND HONORS OUR 

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 -- IS FACILITATING THAT.  I 

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 HAVE SOME STATISTICS HERE.  THE 

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 ATTRACTIVENESS OF STUDY ABROAD 

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 FOR STUDENTS IS A MAJOR 

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 RECRUITING GOAL AND A MAJOR 

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 DRAW FOR SAYING IN COLLEGE AND 

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 I THINK IT SIGNALS NOT ONLY THE 

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 OUR STUDENTS BUT TO THE STATE 

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 AND NATION THAT STUDY ABROAD

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 BELONGS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES 

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 AND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE.  HERE 

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 WE CAN SEE THE NUMBER OF HEY 

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 WARDS YOUR STUDENTS HAVE WON.  

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 THEY ARE HELPED BOY HONORS 

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 EDUCATION TO APPLY FOR THIS AND 

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 THE FACULTY TRIP LEADERS.  WE 

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 HAVE 5 STUDENTS SELECTED FOR 

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 THE CASE PROGRAM IN TUNISIA.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 WE HAVE MAJOR SCHOLARSHIPS FROM

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 RANGE OF STUDENTS.  SOME MIGHT 

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 HAVE TRAVEL EXPERIENCE THAT IS 

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 BENEFICIAL BUT ESSENTIALLY 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE 

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 EXPERIENCE AND THIS IS THEIR 

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 FIRST TIME.  WE SELECT FROM 

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 DIFFERENT MAJORS AND CAMPUSES 

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 AND WE HAVE ANY NUMBER OF 

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 CRITERIA THAT WE USE TO TRY TO 

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 SELECT THE BEST GROUP THAT WE 

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 CAN, THAT'S AN EVEN 

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 DISTRIBUTION IN ANY NUMBER OF 

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 CATEGORIES AND WE DO OUR BEST 

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 BUT WE HAVE WAIT LISTS.  

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 UNFORTUNATELY.  IT IS ALSO -- 

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 IT IS UNFORTUNATE TO TELL 

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 STUDENTS THEY CAN'T GO THAT 

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE AND 

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 NEEDING AND WANTING TO.  THE 

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 MORE HE CAN EXPAND THIS PROGRAM 

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WE CAN 

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 SERVE EACH MORE STUDENTS.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 &gt;&gt;  THANK YOU.  TRUSTEE S

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 SALDIVAR.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 &gt;&gt;  THANK YOU.  I TRULY SUPPORT 

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND I 

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 AM GLAD LONE STAR HAS THEM 

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 BECAUSE I BENEFITED FROM THEM 

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 WHEN I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY.  

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE 

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 TRAVELING OUTSIDE OF THE STATE 

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 AND IT DOES CHANGE YOU.  IT 

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 GIVES YOU A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON 

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 PEOPLES' CULTURES, THE 

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 GOVERNMENT, SOCIAL, EVERYTHING. 

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 SO, YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF LET'S 

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 YOU TO KIND OF THINK WE'RE NOT 

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 THE ONLY ONES, RIGHT?  AND SO 

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 BECAUSE OF THAT I HAVEN'T 

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 STOPPED TRAVELING SO THAT IS 

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 VERY, VERY TRUE.  OBVIOUSLY OUR 

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 UNIVERSITY WAS A LITTLE BIT 

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 DIFFERENT BUT THEY ARE VERY 

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 EXPENSIVE, THOSE PROGRAMS BUT 

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 WE HAD SCHOLARSHIPS FOR THAT.  

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 BUT YOU WOULD THINK AS A 

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 STUDENT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I 

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 THOUGHT, OH I AM GOING TO BE 

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 SITE SEEING EVERYWHERE AND THIS 

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 IS AND THAT BUT NO.  IT'S 

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 REALLY NOT.  YES, YOU CAN SITE 

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 SEE BUT IT GOES WITH THE 

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 PROGRAM BUT IT'S A VERY HARD 

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 AND SORT OF DIFFICULT, RIGHT, 

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 -- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TALK 

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 MORE ABOUT THAT BUT YOU GET SO 

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 ADDICTED TO THAT, THAT ONCE YOU 

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 DO ONE PROGRAM YOU JUST WANT TO 

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 CONTINUE TO DO THAT.  SO THANK 

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 YOU FOR OFFERING THAT.  

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 CHANCELLOR I TRULY DO BELIEVE 

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 IF WE COULD EXPAND THE PROGRAM 

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 BECAUSE IT IS LIFE CHANGING TO 

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 A STUDENT.  IT REALLY IS.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 &gt;&gt;  THANK YOU.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 &gt;&gt;  YOU HAD A QUESTION DIDN'T 

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 YOU AND YOU ASKED IF WE COULD 

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 DO MORE --

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 &gt;&gt;PROFESSOR DAVIS:  BASED ON 

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 WHAT YOU WERE SAYING I DO THING 

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 IT IS NOT JUST THE MUSEUMS AND 

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 THE TRIPS AND THE SITE SEEING.  

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 IT IS ALSO THE CAMARADERIE THE 

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 STUDENTS DEVELOP.  IT IS THE 

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 SMALL THINGS, THE SPACES IN 

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 BETWEEN AND TRYING SOMETHING 

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 NEW, AN ENCOUNTER THEY MIGHT 

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 HAVE, RIDING A TRAIN, PUBLIC 

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 TRAPS PORTAGES, HAVING A 

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY ELSE 

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 THAT MIGHT OPEN THEIR MIND AND 

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 THE MIND OF OTHERS.  IT IS 

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 IMPORTANT AS YOU ILLUSTRATE, IT 

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 IS NOT JUST SENDING THEM OUT 

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 BUT COMING BACK FOR OUR 

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 CAMPUSES AND COLLEGE, FOR THEIR 

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 COLLEAGUES, CHURCHES, AND 

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 COMMUNITIES AND BRINGING THAT 

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 EXPERIENCE AND MAKING THAT 

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 COMMUNITY IN OUR COMMUNITY 

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 COLLEGE THAT MUCH BETTER.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 &gt;&gt;  SO LET ME START WITH THIS, 

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE 

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 ABOUT THE FACULTY EXPERIENCE 

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 BECAUSE IF YOU GO BACK A FEW 

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 PICTURES I GET STRESSED OUT 

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 ABOUT THE FACULTY MEMBER BEING 

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 -- THAT STRESSES ME OUT JUST 

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 LOOKING AT THEM

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 &gt;&gt;PROFESSOR DAVIS:  IT STRESSES 

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 ME OUT.  (LAUGHING).

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 &gt;&gt;CHANCELLOR CASTILLO:  I CAN'T 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 IMAGINE BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR 

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 THAT MANY HUMANS IN A DIFFERENT 

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 COUNTRY BECAUSE I GET LOST BY 

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 MYSELF.  CAN YOU TALK ABOUT 

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 THAT WHAT IS THE STRESS LEVEL 

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 IN BEING ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT 

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 MANY OTHER HUMANS.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 &gt;&gt;PROFESSOR DAVIS:  IT IS 

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 STRESSFUL BUT INTERNATIONAL 

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 EDUCATION WE HAVE TRAININGS 

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  WE HAVE 

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 EXPECTATIONS AND TRAININGS WITH 

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 STUDENTS.  WE HAVE CONTRACTS 

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 ABOUT BEHAVIOR OF COURSE.  

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 THESE ARE ADULTS.  NOBODY GOES 

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 WHO IS NOT OVER 18 BUT IT IS 

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 IMPRESSED UPON THEM THAT THEY 

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 HAVE FUNDING FROM LONE STAR.  

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 THEY ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF 

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 THIS COLLEGE.  WE SELECT BASED 

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 ON THE KINDS OF STUDENTS AND 

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 PEOPLE WE THINK CAN HANDLE 

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 THIS.  WE MEET WITH THE 

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 STUDENTS WELL IN ADVANCE AND 

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS WE 

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 TALK TO THEM ABOUT IS DON'T 

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 RUIN THIS FOR THE NEXT GROUP 

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 AND I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND AND 

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 APPRECIATE THAT.  WE DO HAVE 

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 PARAMETERS AND LIMITS REALIZING 

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 THAT THESE ARE ADULTS BUT THEY 

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 ARE TAKING A COURSE, THEY ARE 

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 PAYING TUITION FOR IT AND MANY 

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 OF THEM ARE GETTING FUNDING AND 

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 I THINK FOR THE MOST PART, IT 

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 GETS THROUGH AND DOESN'T MEAN 

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 THERE AREN'T MISSTEPS ALONG THE 

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 WAY BUT -- MOST OF THE STUDENTS

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
  --

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 &gt;&gt;  (INDISCERNIBLE).

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 &gt;&gt;PROFESSOR DAVIS:  YES, BUT 

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 THERE IS THAT BONDING 

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 EXPERIENCE THAT WE ARE IN IT 

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 FOR EACH OTHER AND WE PICK EACH 

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 OTHER UP AND THOSE THAT HAVE 

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 STRONGER LANGUAGE SKILLS HELP 

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 FACULTY AND HELP THE OTHER 

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 STUDENT, MAYBE HAVE MORE 

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 EXPERIENCE TRAVELING AND CAN 

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 HELP THOSE.  THERE IS CULTURE 

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 SHOCK AND THE NEW, ESPECIALLY 

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 IN SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES THAT 

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 ARE FAR ACROSS THE WORLD.  IT 

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 IS AN EXPERIENCE AND AN 

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 EXPERIENCE FROM FACULTY.  YES, 

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 IT IS STRESSFUL BUT I ALSO 

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I AM A 

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 REPRESENTATIVE AND I CAN SPEAK 

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 FOR THE REST OF FACULTY OF LONE 

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 STAR AND I AM A STEWARD OF LONE 

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 STAR AND THESE STUDENTS AND YOU 

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 KNOW, I THINK AFTER THE FIRST 

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 FEW DAYS MOST OF THESE GROUPS 

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 AND TRIPS REALIZE WE ARE IN 

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 THIS TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH THERE 

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 IS AN INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE, 

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 AND AWARD.  WE ARE DOING IT 

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 COLLECTIVELY.  WE'RE LEARNING.  

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 WE'RE GOING AND WE'RE BRINGING 

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 THIS BACK HOME.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 &gt;&gt;CHANCELLOR CASTILLO:  AND THE 

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 LAST THING I WANT TO SAY, THANK 

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 YOU PROFESSOR IS I AM A SUPPORT 

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 OF WORLD TRAVEL.  I AS A HUMAN 

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 DON'T LIKE TO TRAVEL BECAUSE 

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 THE REASONS IS I GET NERVOUS 

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 BUT I AM A SUPPORTER OF IT 

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 BECAUSE I THINK IN ORDER TO 

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 OFFER WORLD CLASS EDUCATION WE 

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 HAVE TO TRAVEL THE WORLD.  

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT 

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 WE CAN READ ABOUT AND WATCH 

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 VIDEOS BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN 

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE 

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 EXPERIENCED.  ART IS THE A GOOD 

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 EXAMPLE.  YOU CAN SEE A PICTURE 

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 OF ART BUT WHEN YOU STANDING 

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 BEFORE IT THAT IN FRONT OF THE 

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 CANVAS THAT THE ARTIST STROKE 

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 THERE IS A FEELING AND 

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 EDUCATION ABOUT IT.  YOU CAN 

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 READ ABOUT ARCHITECTURE AND 

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 READ ABOUT IT BUT THERE IS 

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 SOMETHING TO SITTING IN FRONT 

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 406 A CATHEDRAL OR MONUMENT 

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 MADE BY HUMANS AND THERE IS AN 

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 EDUCATIONAL ASPECT THAT CAN'T 

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 BE REPLICATED BY INTERNATIONAL 

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 TRAVEL.  I DO THINK WE OFFER A 

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 WORLD CLASS EXPERIENCE HERE AT 

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 LONE LOPE AND PART OF THIS IS 

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 OFFERING A WORLD CLASS 

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 EXPERIENCE.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 &gt;&gt;  PROFESSOR DAVIS BEFORE YOU 

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 LEAVE I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY 

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 YOU WISH YOU COULD MAKE MORE 

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 STUDENTS.  SO I WROTE DOWN WHAT 

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 INTEREST LIMITATIONS AND 

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 BARRIERS.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 &gt;&gt;PROFESSOR DAVIS:  ON A 

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 PARTICULAR TRIP IT WOULD BE 

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 HARD TO TAKE SUCH A LARGE GROUP 

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 WITH FLIGHTS AND LOGISTICS BUT 

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 OPENING UP TO MORE PROGRAMS, 

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 BEING ABLE TO GO.  WE DO 3 OR 4 

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 A YEAR AND THAT'S THE MAIN 

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 STUDY ABROAD AS I HIGHLIGHTED 

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 IN SOME OF THE SLIDES WE HAVE 

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 SHORTER TERM PROGRAMS FOR SURE. 

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 SUPPORT.  AS WAS MENTIONED WITH 

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 THE ONE OF THE PREVIOUS 

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 EXPERIENCES.  RECRUITING X 

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 (MULTIPLE VOICES) REVIEWING 

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 STUDENTS AND MAKING STUDENTS -- 

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 YEAH.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 &gt;&gt;  OKAY.  SECOND QUESTION,

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 IS 

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 THERE -- ON THESE TRIPS AND 

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 WITH STUDY ABROAD, IS THERE A 

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMMUNITY 

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 COLLEGE PARTICIPATION AND OTHER

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 OTHERS?

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 &gt;&gt;PROFESSOR DAVIS:  I DON'T 

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 THINK SO.  I'M NOT QUITE SURE 

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 IN TERMS OF THE KINDS OF TRIPS 

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 WE DO AT LONE STAR.  I DON'T 

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 BELIEVE ARE DIFFERENT OTHER 

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 THAN BEING BETTER.  YOU KNOW, 

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 OURS ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, 

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 CURATES IN-HOUSE.  THE ONE THAT 

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 STEVE DAVIS AND I LED WE HELPED 

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 BOOK THE FLIGHTS AND DO THE 

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 LOGISTICS.  WE DO HAVE SOME 

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 OTHERS WITH PARTNERSHIPS THAT 

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 ARE READY MADE THAT WE CAN 

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 SEGUE INTO AND THOSE ARE VAL

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 VALLABLE TOO AND THAT HELPS US 

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 TO ITS SCALE.  MOST OF THE 

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 OTHER STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS AT 

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 BIG UNIVERSITIES, THEY GET 

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 STUDENT FROM ALL OVER THE 

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 COUNTRY.  UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS 

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 STUDY ABROAD YOU HAVE STUDENTS 

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 FROM NEW YORK AND OTHER 

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE YES, THERE 

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 IS SOMETHING VALUABLE BUT IT IS 

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 POSSIBLY A MONEY MAKER.  OURS 

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 ISN'T TO MAKE MONEY BUT FOCUS 

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 ON STUDENTS AND GIVE THEM THE 

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 BEST EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE AND WE 

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 WORK HARD TO KEEP THOSE COSTS 

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 DOWN BUT ALSO MAKE IT SAFE, 

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 REWARDING, ENJOYABLE AND IT'S 

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 KIND OF A HOME GROWN HERE AT 

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.  BUT IN 

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 TERMS OF THE COURSES THEY ARE 

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 TAKING AND EXPERIENCES THEY 

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 HAVE, I CHALLENGE ANY OTHER 

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM FROM 

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 HARVARD TO THE UNIVERSITY OF

 TOGETHER AS TO GIVE THE 

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 EXPERIENCE.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 &gt;&gt;  THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO END 

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 YOUR PRESENTATION AND THANK 

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 REWARDING TO SEE THEM 

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 EXPERIENCE THAT.  I WAS 

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 FIRST TIME AND I FREQUENT THE 

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000

 WILL BE A REGULAR WITH LONE 

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 STAR BUT I AM DEFINITELY GOING 

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 TO INVITE MORE PEOPLE TO THIS.  

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 WE HAD THE BEST SEATS THAT YOU 

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 COULD ASK FOR AND WE ARE PROUD 

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 TO REPRESENT LONE STAR THERE 

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 AND JUST THE REALLY GREAT 

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 PROGRAM.  A LOT OF THE 

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 PERFORMERS WITH THE MAYOR ASHY 

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 GROUP AND I BELIEVE THEY WERE 

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 CALLED (INDISCERNIBLE) -- THEY 

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 WERE TEACH EGGS AND INSTRUCTORS 

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 AND THEIR FRIENDS 06 A FRIEND 

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 AND SO IT WAS A REALLY GOOD 

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 EXPERIENCE AND THEY DID AN 

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 AMAZING SHOW.  VERY RICH 

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 CULTURALLY AND ME PERSON 

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 NATIONALLY I AM NOT OF MEXICAN 

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 HERITAGE BUT I GOT TO LEARN A 

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 LOT ABOUT THE HERITAGE AND 

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 CULTURE AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO 

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 SEE THAT AND EXPERIENCE THAT 

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 AND ALSO WITH MY PARENTS.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 MY MOTHER JUST GOTTEN ROLLED 

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 HER INTO THE ACADEMY FOR 

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 LIFELONG LEARNING PROGRAM.  SHE 

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 ATTENDED A TIACHI CLASS AND 

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 ENJOYED AND GOT LOST ON CAMPUS 

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 BUT SOMEONE WHO WAS A FRIENDLY 

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 FACE HELPED HER OUT AND SHE 

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 LEARNED A LITTLE AND I THINK 

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 SHE IS ATTENDING A FIELD TRIP 

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 AND DOING SOME OTHER CLASS SOS 

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 I AM REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE 

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 COLLEGE TO OFFER THAT PROGRAM 

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 AND THE OTHER DAY I WAS RUNNING 

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 AT THE TRACK OF MY LOCAL MIDDLE 

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 PROGRAM AND SO HOPEFUL WE CAN 

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 GET MORE INSOLD.  I DIDN'T 

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000

 LAST MONTH BUT I ATTEND AD PLAY 

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
 OFF THIS YEAR AND WE DID NOT 

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
 RECEIVE THE STATE A 

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
 APPROPRIATIONS IN THE TARGETED 

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
 MONTH OF JUNE.  AS I INDICATED 

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
 LAST MONTH THEY WERE DOWN AND 

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
 SHOWED THE DISTRIBUTION.  THE 

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
 STATE -- THE CHECK WAS IN THE 

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
 MAIL AS YOU SAY AND IT WAS 

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
 RECEIVED AND HAS BEEN 

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
 RECONCILED AND WE DID RECEIVE 

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
 THE FINAL PAYMENT SO ALL STATE 

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
 APPROPRIATIONS WERE RECEIVED TO 

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
 THE TUNE OF 

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
 $114 MILLION PUTTING IT BACK IN 

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
 LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS.  I WANT 

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
 TO POINT IT OUT LATER ON THAT 

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
 MISCELLANEOUS REVENUES CONTINUE 

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
 TO TRACK UNDER AND THAT THE 

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
 DIRECTED TO FAST FUNDING.  I 

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
 MENTIONED IT SEVERAL TIMES.  WE 

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
 HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY OF THE 

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
 FAS FUNDING FOR FALL OR SPRING 

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
 SEMESTERS.  ON 8/27 WE DID 

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
 RECEIVE THE FALL PAYMENT OF 

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
 $2.8 MILLION AND THAT IS NOT 

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 REFLECTED HERE BECAUSE IT IS IN 

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
 CLOSE OUT BUT I DID WANT TO SAY 

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
 THAT MISCELLANEOUS REVENUES ARE 

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
 DOWN DUE TO FAS FUNDING AND 

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
 THEY ARE CONTINUING TO TRICKLE 

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
 IN BUT MID SEPTEMBER BEFORE WE 

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
 RECEIVE EVERYTHING DUE FOR 

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
 FY235.  I KNOW THERE ARE LOTS 

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
 OF QUESTIONS AND CONVERSATIONS 

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
 ABOUT FAS FUNDING AND STATE 

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 APPROPRIATIONS SO END TO 

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
 HIGHLIGHT THEM.  WHEN WE LOOK 

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
 AT EXPENDITURES YOU CAN SEE 

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
 THAT MOST OF ALL ARE IN LINE 

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 WITH WHERE WE HAVE TRACKED THIS 

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
 TIME LAST YEAR.  YOU CAN SEE AN 

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
 INCREASE IN SALARIES YEAR OVER 

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
 YEAR.  THE BIGGEST ATESTAMENT 

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
 TO THAT IS A CONTINUED INCREASE 

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
 IN COMPENSATION PACKAGES THAT 

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000

 A LOT OF THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS 

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
 ARE TRACKING AND SHOWING UP 

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
 THIS TIME OF YEAR SO YOU CAN 

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
 INCREASE IN SALARIES BUT WELL 

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
 IN TUNE WITH WHAT WAS EXPECTED. 

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
 WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT YEAR TO

 AGAIN, ALWAYS A POSITIVE NOTE 

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
 WHEN THE CHARTS EXCEED WHAT WAS 

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
 BUNDLED.  WE BUMPED 

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
 $513 MILLION AND AS OF THE LAST 

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
 DAY IN JULY WE ARE AT 

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 APPROXIMATELY SO 3.8% OF WHAT 

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
 WE BUDGETED.  WE WILL EXCEED 

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
 BUDGETED REVENUES FOR THIS 

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
 YEAR.  AND AGAIN NOT IN TAKING 

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000

 RECEIVED IN AUGUST WHICH WILL 

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
 BE REPORTED NEXT MONTH.  WE TIP 

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
 TO TRACK WELL BELOW BUDGETED 

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000

 $26 MILLION MORE THAN WHAT WAS 

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
 BUNDLED THIS FY25 YEAR.  SO IT 

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
 IS A GOOD CONCEPT TO HAVE MORE 

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
